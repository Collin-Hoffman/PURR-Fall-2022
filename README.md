# PURR-Fall-2022
Work done for the PURR project in Fall 2022. This work includes finishing the data visualization project from the previous semester (BoW).

Additionally, files regarding the preprocessing and building of classifiers for the MDPI data set are included. There are 3 Excel files (Test, Train, and Validation Data).
The Python code that runs this is contained in a Jupyter Notebook file. The MDPI files that were used are included in a zip file.
