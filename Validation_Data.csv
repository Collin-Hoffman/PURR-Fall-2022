0,"Coastal forests cover less than 3% of the Earth’s surface yet sequester and store as much carbon (C) as their terrestrial counterparts [1,2]. By storing carbon in vegetation and sediments, coastal forests play important roles in biogeochemical carbon (C) cycling and mitigating climate change [3,4]. Coastal forests provide a suite of additional ecosystem services, including storm surge protection, wildlife habitat, water filtration, and recreational opportunities [3,5]. At the terrestrial–ocean interface, coastal forests are disproportionately impacted by pressures from human land use modifications and sea level rise, altering the structure and function of these valuable ecosystems [6]. Sea level rise rates are accelerating, outpacing the average 20th century rates, and leading to increased flooding and erosion, saltwater intrusion, and coastal forest loss [7]. At the same time, rapid population growth, demand for food and fiber, and unconstrained coastal development have caused rapid declines in the health and extent of coastal forests [4]. The interactive effects of sea level rise, land use, and other disturbances (e.g., wildfires) impact the quantity and quality of ecosystem services supplied by coastal forests [8], but regional assessments that account for these effects together are limited [9], and few account for spatial dependencies and nonstationarity in the socio-spatial processes driving ecosystem change. Declines in coastal forest health highlight the need for targeted human interventions. More comprehensive regional assessments that explicitly account for socio-spatial processes are critical to understand how and where different adaptation and management strategies will be most effective.The exposure of freshwater-dependent coastal forests to saltwater from accelerating rates of sea level rise alters freshwater and terrestrial biota and biogeochemical cycling, subsequently altering the carbon storage potential of coastal forests [10,11,12]. Coastal forests generally share characteristics of both wetlands and uplands, and thus sequester and store carbon in both aboveground biomass (e.g., vegetation) and in hydric soils that provide significant long-term stores of carbon [13]. Though C burial rates are highly variable, global rates for tropical mangrove forests, for example, are approximately 31–34 TgC y−1 compared to 78 TgC y−1 in tropical upland forests, despite covering less than 1% of the area covered by tropical forests [13]. These soils are often peat, water-saturated soils that make conditions favorable for anaerobic decomposition and subsequent carbon storage [11]. Wetland drainage and disturbances such as storm surge inundation can cause the rapid collapse of freshwater peats, particularly after vegetation dies off [14]. However, these dynamics and the associated impacts on carbon storage remain poorly understood. The large C stocks stored in coastal forests’ vegetation and soils highlight the important, yet largely unexamined, role in the global sequestration and storage of carbon that would otherwise remain as atmospheric CO2 and exacerbate climate change [13,15,16,17].As sea levels rise and storm surge events increase in frequency and severity, saltwater intrusion, the inland movement of seawater via natural and manmade conduits (e.g., streams and irrigation canals), will become increasingly commonplace. Though freshwater-dependent forests can withstand brief periods of inundation and associated saltwater exposure, prolonged periods result in tree mortality and limited regeneration [18,19,20]. More salt-tolerant herbaceous species move into these areas, altering species composition and ecological function [21,22]. The process is often referred to as marsh migration, and the stands of dead or dying trees that remain are known as ‘ghost forests’, marking the landward reach of sea level rise impacts [23]. Along the North American Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, this phenomenon is particularly prevalent because sea level rise rates here are three times the global average of ~0.6 mm yr−1 [24], due in part to rapid land subsidence [25,26]. Coastal forests will continue to retreat landward, provided barriers such as roads, other infrastructure, or incompatible land uses do not exist [6]. Targeted adaptation and management activities can enhance forest resilience or facilitate marsh migration, but this requires knowledge of the environmental and land use conditions affecting site suitability and disturbance regimes.While coastal forests are particularly vulnerable to sea level rise long term, land use activities, resource management (e.g., water use) and other disturbances (e.g., wildfires) are near-term threats. Land use change, and the interactive effects between land use change and sea level rise, will largely determine where and how much carbon is stored in coastal forests [27]. Land ownership in coastal landscapes involves private landowners and operators as well as local, regional, state, and federal agencies [23,28]. The land use decisions of individuals and organizations have regional impacts and necessitate approaches that account for socio-spatial processes in coastal planning, adaptation, and management. These processes often give rise to spatial heterogeneity in the relationships between environmental, land use, and disturbance drivers and coastal forest change. For example, if the relationship between coastal forest health and canal density changes across the study area, we might infer that the relationship exhibits spatial nonstationarity and that there are unmeasured social processes driving these variations. To understand where and when specific planning and management activities will be most successful, it is critical to not only quantify the relationships between coastal forest change and associated drivers of change [29] but also evaluate how these relationships might vary across space.To date, research on carbon flux (e.g., the driving processes and controls of C dynamics) in temperate coastal forests has focused on findings from field studies [2,4,30]. These studies are requisite to an understanding of the fine scale processes driving coastal forest carbon change, but their applicability at regional scales is limited. They can be used, however, in conjunction with other data to scale up C cycling estimates for regional and landscape scale assessments. The use of remote sensing data in aboveground carbon estimation, with its broad coverage and moderate-to-high spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions has become an important field of research in recent years [31]. Carbon has been successfully estimated using derived spectral metrics from multispectral satellite imagery [32,33,34], structural metrics from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data [35,36,37,38], or a combination of the two [39,40,41] in correlative models linking these metrics with field data and has become a common source for carbon estimation at regional scales. Access to multitemporal remote sensing data provides additional opportunities to measure change in carbon stocks over time; however regional analyses assessing carbon dynamics have focused on upland forests (e.g., [42,43,44,45]), herbaceous marsh (e.g., [46]), and mangrove forests (e.g., [47,48]) and not temperate coastal forests (however, see [49]). These studies also do not quantify the combined effects of the natural and anthropogenic factors driving carbon variability and change at regional scales, nor do they account for the spatial heterogeneity in the strength of the relationships between drivers and aboveground carbon stocks by implementing appropriate spatial modeling approaches. Traditional nonspatial regression models cannot capture local variation (in geographic space) in relationships between drivers and responses (referred to as spatial non-stationarity) [50]. Local spatial regression methods, however, can account for variation resulting from the location (non-stationarity) or the spatial scale considered (grain size, sampling interval, or spatial extent) and are well suited to quantify the relationships between drivers of carbon change and the change itself [51]. All of these are requisite to cost effective adaptation, conservation, and management [13,52].To address these knowledge gaps, we quantified spatiotemporal patterns of aboveground carbon change over a decade (2001–2014) across one of the largest, most vulnerable regions of coastal forest in North America using a combination of field measurements, multispectral satellite imagery, and LiDAR data. We developed a suite of sea level rise, land use, and disturbance drivers and applied global and local spatial regression approaches to model relationships between these drivers and aboveground carbon change. We address the following questions: (1) How do the relationships between aboveground carbon decline and sea level rise, land use, and natural disturbance drivers vary across the landscape? (2) What are the relative contributions of land use, natural disturbance, and sea level rise drivers to carbon decline? (3) Using the spatial regression models developed, what are the future potential aboveground carbon declines as sea levels rise? Our results strengthen the case for the value of coastal forests’ role in the global carbon cycle and highlight the need for similar research on other carbon pools in coastal forests (e.g., soils). Additionally, understanding the drivers of variability in coastal forests’ carbon stores can help managers allocate resources effectively and implement appropriate conservation, adaptation, and management strategies with the potential to address regional carbon management and climate mitigation needs.", 1.

1,"The study area is a 4000 km2 coastal region located west of the Albemarle-Pamlico Estuary in Eastern North Carolina and buffered from the Atlantic Ocean by a chain of barrier islands (Figure 1). Forested and herbaceous wetlands, together, cover more than 50 percent of the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula. Almost half (47%) of the study area lies below 1 m in elevation, making it particularly vulnerable to sea level rise impacts. Forty percent of the peninsula is publicly owned, most of which can be considered ‘public-non extractive’ land or areas without extractive activities but that may still be managed for biodiversity (e.g., mimicking disturbance events through prescribed fires). ‘Public extractive’ lands are those lands subject to extractive uses (e.g., logging or mining). Private property (60% of the study area) is a mix of natural forest, agricultural lands, and forestry uses. Agriculture and forestry are two main economic drivers, contributing to the state approximately $367 million in agriculture cash receipts and $342.8 million from forest output per year [53]. Industrial forests and agricultural lands occur in low-elevation areas and are thus highly managed with canals, water control structures, and impoundments.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study System,2
2,"We mapped aboveground biomass change between 2001 and 2014 using a combination of field measurements, repeat light detection and ranging (LiDAR) surveys (see Table S1 for specifications) [54,55], and Landsat imagery (see Table S2 for specifications) [49,56]. We quantified vegetation structure and composition with metrics derived from LiDAR and Landsat data for 2001 and 2014 (see Tables S3 and S4 for complete lists of satellite-derived and LiDAR-derived variables). To relate the remote sensing metrics to aboveground biomass, we inventoried the size and density of woody vegetation in 98 plots of 12 m radius [57] across a vegetation gradient from forest to marsh [49]. We calculated total (e.g., woody and herbaceous species) aboveground biomass in megagrams per hectare (Mg ha−1), from these field measurements using established allometric equations [58,59,60] relating diameter at breast height (dbh) or percent cover to total aboveground biomass. We applied the random forest machine learning algorithm (RF; [61]) to quantify relationships between aboveground biomass field measurements and remotely sensed metrics and predict aboveground biomass across the entire study area for 2001 and 2014. RF is an ensemble learning method for classification and regression that functions by constructing many decision trees for model training and then generating mean predictions or the mode of classes across the individual trees. The algorithm corrects for decision trees’ tendency to overfit their training datasets through the bootstrap approach [61]. Using 1000 permutations of the final fitted RF model, we tested model significance, performed validation withholding 30% of the training data, and generated metrics of predictor variable importance. We used the model improvement ratio (MIR) function to select the best predictor variables among the suite of candidate variables, following the methods found in [42]. We then quantified aboveground biomass change by comparing the output maps of aboveground biomass for 2001 and 2014 (Figure 2a and Figure 3a). The RF models performed well (2014 biomass: R2adj. = 0.78, RMSE = 15.0 Mg ha−1, % RMSE = 9.5; 2001 biomass: R2adj. = 0.75, RMSE = 18.3 Mg ha−1, % RMSE = 12.6) [49] (Figure S1). Metrics that contributed most to overall predictive power included mean and median vegetation height, highlighting the importance of vegetation structure for estimating aboveground biomass (Figure S2). We converted aboveground biomass change to carbon loads assuming a carbon concentration of 0.5 [62]. We developed a binary 30-m resolution map of carbon declines, where a value of 1.0 represented any cell with a decrease in carbon over the 13-year period, and a value of 0.0 was assigned to any cell with either no change or an increase in carbon storage. We excluded from the binary map non-vegetated cells and cells classified as developed or agriculture in 2001 or 2014.Using variogram analysis, we identified 450 m as an appropriate level of aggregation for the response variable (Figure S3). We overlaid the binary carbon decline maps with a 450 × 450-m regular grid and calculated the fraction of the percentage of vegetated area within each modeling unit experiencing carbon declines (Figure 3b).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Mapping Coastal Forest Carbon Declines,2
3,"We developed a suite of variables that we expected to be drivers of carbon declines and classified them into different representative classes—land use, natural disturbance, and sea level rise drivers (for complete list, see Table 1). 2.3.1. Land Use DriversLand use activities and modifications, such as farming, forestry, and even land abandonment, influence carbon storage and flux on the landscape. Agricultural and forestry pressures (as quantified by agricultural pressure and harvest intensity described below) can alter soil properties, increase nutrient runoff, and change vegetation composition, all of which influence carbon pools both in the areas actively managed and on spatially adjacent or nearby lands [4,9]. Land abandonment (e.g., fallow lands) can also change carbon pools by allowing for natural regeneration, providing buffers from storms for nearby lands, and increasing productivity on site or nearby [51]. Because of their potential to influence carbon fluxes, we included several land use-related variables, derived from spatial datasets, as described in more detail below.Agricultural and Fallow Pressure.To account for pressures from agriculture or land abandonment that might influence carbon, we extracted all agricultural lands from the 30-m resolution 2001 National Land Cover Dataset [64] raster and applied a gravity modeling technique, computing for each cell the number of neighboring agricultural cells within a search distance, weighted by a distance decay function [65,66]. This variable accounts for the effect of agricultural lands on nearby forest carbon changes, with more proximate agricultural lands having a stronger influence, as controlled by a coefficient for the distance decay function. For land abandonment, we applied the same methods, extracting instead the fallow land use class from the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service’s Cropscape dataset [67].Harvest Intensity.To identify possible forestry-related land use modifications, we developed a ‘harvest intensity’ metric to quantify changes related to industrial timber harvesting and clearing. We selected the pre-processed annual average Landsat-based Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) for every year between 2001 and 2014 from Google Earth Engine [68]. We calculated year-to-year EVI differences and applied a threshold to the average change values to differentiate acute or harvest events from normal variability in EVI based on approximately one standard deviation from the average change values across all year-to-year differences (+/−0.12). We created the ‘harvest intensity index’ by summing all binary rasters created after threshold application; each value in the raster represented the number of times that a cell experienced an acute event during the study period. We removed acute events due to wildfires from the harvest intensity metric because wildfires were accounted for in a separate predictor variable. 2.3.2. Sea Level Rise DriversSea level rise and associated climatic factors can drive changes in carbon storage and flux through a variety of mechanisms [13,14]. To capture general trends or changes in climate, we included climatic variables such as mean precipitation and temperature deviations over the last decade. As climate changes, extreme weather events, such as flooding and hurricanes, are expected to become more frequent and severe [7,25]. Though acute, these events can have lasting impacts on coastal carbon storage—both aboveground and in soils—by altering vegetation and soil composition. These impacts can be compounded by accelerating rates of sea level rise [19,20,29]. To address the potential for these factors to influence carbon flux, we included drivers related to where hurricane storm surges occur (e.g., slow and fast storm surge variables), where water flows and accumulates on the landscape (e.g., elevation, flow direction and accumulation), and proximity to bodies of water (e.g., distance to estuarine shoreline).Saltwater intrusion, resulting from a combination of both acute events and gradual sea level rise, facilitates changes in vegetation composition and subsequent carbon storage. Long term saltwater exposure in freshwater-dependent forests leads to osmotic stress and eventual mortality [14,20,21]. More salt-tolerant herbaceous species will replace tree species, changing carbon storage capacity, particularly aboveground. Hurricanes and even droughts (by shifting the freshwater–saltwater interface landward) can bring saltwater inland into areas not adapted to saltwater exposure [10,12]. Drainage networks, comprised of canals and ditches, though built to keep water off coastal lands, can serve as conduits during storms, to move water inland [51]. Because salt influences aboveground and soil carbon storage, we included spatial data representing the likelihood of salt impacts by accounting for potential pathways (e.g., the density of canals connected to the estuarine shoreline) and overall salinity values in the adjacent estuary (interpolated from water quality monitoring stations across the landscape). Other factors such as elevation, hurricane storm surge extents, and distance to the estuarine shoreline also indirectly influence where saltwater exposure occurs on the landscape.Connected Canal Density.We incorporated hydrological connectivity between coastal forests and the adjacent estuary by extracting artificial drainage features from the US Geological Survey’s National Hydrography Dataset [69]. We removed any isolated canals not connected by other canals or natural water features to the estuarine shoreline. We then calculated the density of linear canal features surrounding each 30-m raster cell using multiple search radii values, ultimately selecting a 1000-m search radius for the final predictor variable.Salinity.We used the US Environmental Protection Agency’s STOrage and RETrieval (STORET) database to extract average salinity values (in parts per thousand; ppt) for 3500+ observations from 40 water quality monitoring sites in the Albemarle and Pamlico Sounds between 2001 and 2014 [70]. To interpolate a surface from these point data, we performed an inverse distance weighting interpolation at 30 m resolution [71]. 2.3.3. Natural Disturbance DriversFrequent, low intensity fires have historically maintained these landscapes [72]. However, catastrophic fires can alter carbon pools by burning the rich organic soils in addition to the vegetation. Though regeneration occurs naturally and rapidly post-fire, interactions between fire, extreme weather events, and climate change can alter carbon storage and flux in unanticipated ways. We included a variable that measures the length of time since a wildfire for the study period to capture these changes in carbon storage and flux.Time Since Fire.We used the spatially explicit fire perimeters developed by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity Program (MTBS; [73]) and extracted the year of fire attribute to assign the number of years since fire for every fire polygon across the study area.", 2.

7,"We mapped all predictor variables at a 30-m spatial resolution and then aggregated cell values to the spatial modeling unit (450 × 450-m grid cells) via majority (for nominal data) or mean (for continuous data) aggregation methods and derived values for each grid cell. Prior to model fitting, we evaluated predictor variables for multicollinearity and selected a set of uncorrelated (r < 0.5) variables from our initial list (Figure S4). We scaled all variables to values between 0.0 and 1.0 using a minimum–maximum normalization, which retained the original distribution spread but allowed us to evaluate relative contributions of different drivers.We modeled the relationships between fractional carbon declines and predictor variables using ordinary least squares regression (OLS), a conventional global regression technique, and geographically weighted regression (GWR), a local regression method (Figure 2b). GWR detects heterogeneity in data relationships across geographic space via the fitting of individual localized ordinary least squares regressions [74]. This allows for local variations in rates of change. Coefficients in the model are not global estimates but are specific to a particular location and based on observations taken at sample points near that location [51,75].

In ordinary least squares, the sum of the squared differences of predicted and observed

is minimized in the coefficient estimates. In weighted least squares, a weighting factor is applied to each squared difference before minimizing so that the inaccuracy of some predictions carries more of a penalty than others. In weighted regression models the values of the weighting factor are constant so that only one calibration is carried out. In geographically weighted regression, the weighting factor varies with location i so that a different calibration exists for every point in the study area. The geographical weighting is implemented through a spatial kernel function. Common choices for weighting function include Gaussian, bisquare, or tricubic [52]. In addition to the weighting function, a bandwidth is needed that determines the rate of distance decay for each of the data weightings. A large bandwidth smooths parameter estimates, approaching the estimates provided by the global regression, and a small bandwidth tends to sharpen them. The bandwidth can be user-defined or determined using cross-validation (CV) or Akaike’s information criterion (AIC) and can be either a fixed distance or a set number of nearest neighbors (adaptive bandwidth). To minimize potential edge effects, we used an adaptive Gaussian kernel function with an optimal bandwidth selected based on a least squares CV that minimized the squared error. All statistical analyses were carried out using R statistical software and the GWR analyses were performed using the ‘spgwr’ package for R [76,77].We examined the variance explained by the global and local regression models, Moran’s I tests of model residuals, and the statistical significance and relative importance of predictor variables. We also quantified spatial dependencies and nonstationarity in the relationships between the response and predictor variables by mapping residuals and testing the interquartile ranges of the local coefficient estimates provided by GWR. Additionally, we used the studentized Breusch–Pagan test for heteroscedasticity to identify non-constant variance in the errors. We derived a pseudo-significance test for predictor variables by calculating t-values for each local regression and mapping t-values spatially to identify locations that are statistically significant at alpha = 0.05 [51].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Statistical Modeling Approach,2
8,"We used spatial models of future sea level rise inundation from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to forecast future forest carbon decline [78]. The data depict the potential inundation of coastal areas resulting from a projected 0.3 to 1.8 m sea level rise above current mean higher high water (MHHW) conditions. The values represent the projections for the intermediate to high global mean sea level (GMSL) scenario, which predicts sea levels under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This is considered the high-emissions scenario and is referred to as the business-as-usual scenario, which suggests that it is a likely outcome if society does not make concerted efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The model is a function of static elevation and hydrologic connectivity but does not account for other factors such as vertical accretion or subsidence rates, nor does it account for storm surge potential. We calculated total coastal forest carbon loss, measured in teragrams of carbon (TgC), through 2100 by combining our 2014 aboveground carbon maps and the GMSL inundation models. To predict future coastal forest declines in areas not inundated, we updated the distance to the estuarine shoreline predictor variable used in our GWR model using the new estuarine shoreline extent under inundation levels between 0.3 and 1.8 m. Holding all other predictor variables constant, we re-ran the GWR model and examined the resulting predicted fractional carbon declines on the remaining study area (Figure 2c).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Predicting Future Coastal Forest Carbon Declines from Sea Level Rise,2
9,"The global regression model explained 39% of the variation in fractional aboveground carbon declines. Statistically significant predictor variables included in the final model were agricultural pressure, connected canal density, time since fire, harvest intensity, distance to shoreline, and salinity (p < 0.05). We found negative relationships between fractional aboveground carbon declines and agricultural pressure, time since fire, and distance to estuarine shoreline. We found positive relationships between fractional aboveground carbon declines and canal density, harvest intensity, and salinity (Table 2).Land use and disturbance metrics were the most important predictors of variation in fractional carbon decline within the global model, with agricultural pressure explaining the most variation, followed by the time-since-fire variable (Figure 4). Moran’s I tests indicated autocorrelation in the response variable, even at the aggregated 450-m resolution (Moran’s I = 0.75, z-score = 167.77, p-value < 0.0001). The relationship between the predictor variables and the response variable exhibited nonstationarity (Breusch–Pagan statistic = 4092.4, p-value < 0001).Predictive performance improved with the local regression model, with a lower AIC and higher quasi-global R2. The GWR model explained 52% of the variance, and quasi-global R2 values ranged from 0.08 to 0.79, with more than 50% of the landscape having a local R2 value greater than the global R2 of 0.39 (Figure 5a). Standard errors ranged from a low of 0.006 to a high of 0.06 (Figure 5b). Coefficients for all predictor variables exhibited patterns of spatial non-stationarity according to tests for spatial dependencies (Figure 6).We found a statistically significant negative relationship between fractional carbon decline and agricultural pressure, canal density, and distance to the estuarine shoreline in the GWR. The range of local coefficient values and statistical significance varied across space, indicating spatial dependencies in the data. On average, we found statistically significant positive relationships between fractional carbon declines and harvest intensity, time since fire, and salinity with spatial heterogeneity in local regression coefficients and statistical significance.For 52% of the study area, land use and disturbance drivers had the strongest regression coefficients (13% of the total landscape for agricultural pressure, 13% for harvest intensity, and 26% for time since fire), and for 48% of the study area the sea level rise variables had the largest regression coefficients (2% of the total landscape for canal density, 20% for distance to estuarine shoreline, and 27% for salinity). In the southeast portion of the study area, the sea level rise drivers best explained variation in carbon declines (e.g., Figure 6c,d). In the northeast portion of the study area, both land use/disturbance drivers and sea level rise drivers contribute to declines (Figure 6). To the interior, relationships were mixed, with land use drivers most important in areas dominated by agricultural and forestry operations and sea level rise drivers generally most important in interior areas connected to the estuary via canals (e.g., Figure 6b–f).", 3.

10,"We estimated a minimum inundation extent of 1094 km2 for a 0.3 m rise in sea level and a maximum extent of 2914 km2 for a 1.8 m rise in sea level (Figure 7). Associated losses in total aboveground carbon ranged from 2.9 ± 0.1 TgC (0.3 m rise) to 8.6 ± 0.3 TgC (1.8 m rise). On the remaining landscape, we calculated potential declines increasing from 29% to 32% between a 0.3 and 1.8 m rise in sea level. The greatest changes in carbon declines are visible in each scenario adjacent to the shoreline and surrounding the lakes in the study area’s interior (Figure 8).", 3. Results, 3.2. Future Coastal Forest Declines,3
11,"Sea level rise, land use activities, and disturbances act synergistically in low-lying coastal forests to alter their structure and function, affecting the ecosystem services they provide. A regional scale understanding of where and how these forests have changed and where to expect future change is critical for prioritizing funding for management and establishing resilient coastal communities. Spatial heterogeneity in the drivers of coastal forest degradation, however, make quantification at regional scales difficult. To address this challenge, we examined the drivers of coastal forest degradation using a local regression approach that accounts for these spatial processes. Using geographically weighted regression (GWR), we examined the relationship between coastal forest fractional carbon declines and land use, disturbance, and sea level rise drivers. We found the patterns of influence to be spatially heterogeneous, providing local insights at regional scales, highlighting the benefit of using a local regression approach to inform management and resource allocation activities more effectively [50,80].In a low-lying coastal region highly exposed to impacts from sea level rise, we observed that land use and disturbance metrics were the strongest drivers of fractional carbon declines. Agricultural pressure, harvest intensity, and time since fire explained most of the variation in the global model. Interestingly we found a negative relationship between agricultural pressure and fractional carbon declines. Because agricultural lands are generally located at higher elevations in the interior of the study area, the adjacent coastal forests are likely less susceptible to the effects of saltwater intrusion and sea level rise than lower elevation coastal forests near the shore. Alternatively, water control structures, tide gates, and other measures intended to protect the productivity of large-scale agricultural operations may also benefit the coastal forests in these higher elevation areas. In addition to agriculture, approximately 13% of the study area’s inland coastal forests are managed as loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations for timber harvest revenues, which removes a significant amount of aboveground carbon [81]. Though stand-replacing disturbances (e.g., harvests) lead to a net forest C loss, replanting as part of the rotational cycle will eventually replace the lost carbon. However, if trees do not reach maturity and peak primary productivity before subsequent harvests [4,9], increased harvest intensity could result in net carbon losses as was demonstrated in the positive relationship between harvest intensity and aboveground carbon declines in our results.Natural disturbance events play an important role in coastal forest carbon dynamics. Both the local and global regression models indicated that the time-since-fire metric contributed significantly to the explanatory power of the model, explaining 36% of the model variation. The more recent the fire event, the higher the fractional carbon declines. Despite a low prevalence of prescribed fire and wildfire in our study area compared to historical estimates, fire remains one of the most important drivers of carbon dynamics on the APP [80]. During the study period, several catastrophic wildfires occurred on the Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula. Though severe wildfires result in aboveground carbon declines, many of the region’s tree species are adapted to fire and regenerate rapidly after fire disturbances [72]. However, if saltwater exposure occurs post-fire, regeneration may be limited by salinity intolerance of the saplings. Accordingly, fire disturbances and saltwater exposure can act synergistically to accelerate forest retreat and facilitate marsh migration of salt-tolerant herbaceous species into the area [19,20].Although our global regression model indicated sea level rise metrics contributed minimally to the overall explanatory power of the model (explaining only 6.8% of model variation), our local regression model identified places on the landscape where these metrics played a strong and significant role in fractional carbon declines. Distance to the estuarine shoreline, salinity, and connected canal density were important predictors of fractional carbon declines in the northeast and eastern portions of our study area. That there are high levels of spatial heterogeneity in these relationships reinforces the need to consider local spatial regression approaches in dynamic coastal systems. Sea level rise factors are a critical and significant driver of fractional carbon declines, but only near the shoreline and in areas predicted to have high salinities. Unlike the global regression model, our local spatial regression approach can be used to identify the extent and strength of influence for each of these sea level rise drivers in a spatially explicit way. Because the changes associated with saltwater intrusion and sea level rise are likely to be permanent, our approach can be used to identify areas unlikely to recover or return to coastal forest, particularly as sea level rise accelerates. This information can then be used to make more informed decisions about policy, mitigation, and the prioritization of limited resources.Our results indicate that by 2090, the study area could lose approximately 8.6 TgC of aboveground carbon because of inundation from sea level rise, with the remaining landscape experiencing, on average, 32% fractional declines in carbon. These estimates, however, do not account for future vegetation growth or succession, nor do they consider a potential shift in carbon storage, from aboveground to belowground [2]. This highlights the need to consider impacts on other carbon pools in coastal forests (e.g., soils) and landscape context because shifts in carbon storage in one location alter the amount of carbon stored in another location. Considering these aspects and incorporating potential non-linear relationships, feedbacks, and interactions between natural and anthropogenic drivers via mechanistic or process-based models would provide additional support for targeted adaptation and management activities.Our study underscores the importance of human interventions in determining future coastal forest resilience. The spatial variation in driving forces of coastal forest degradation has significant implications for prioritizing management activities. Our results indicate that along the shoreline and in the eastern portion of the study area the best management decision might be to facilitate marsh migration, whereas inland there may be more opportunities to work with landowners in conserving or restoring coastal forests. Management of drainage networks, originally built to drain wetlands and lower water tables for agricultural and forestry operations, is another important consideration [81,82]. In the near term these features help mitigate flooding; however, our results from lower elevation coastal forests adjacent to the estuaries suggest that without effective canal and ditch management, these networks act as conduits for saltwater intrusion from extreme weather events and gradual sea level rise [81]. In addition to water management, proactive coastal forest management activities such as lengthened harvest cycles, restricted harvests, and selective harvesting have the potential to enhance the carbon storage and coastal resilience [9]. Selective harvesting and tree species diversification on plantations will also play an important role as sea levels rise and saltwater intrusion increasingly affects forestry operations. Timber harvest revenues can be sustained by harvesting the most at-risk timber (e.g., timber most affected by inundation and saltwater exposure). The common practice of planting a single timber species on plantations increases the likelihood of widespread mortality during extreme storm and flooding events, particularly if that single species is salt-intolerant. Planting a more diverse set of species with a range of salinity tolerances will decrease the severity of impact from extreme storm events and produce added co-benefits associated with increased diversity [83].", 4. Discussion,None,4
12,"Our analysis illustrates several key points. First, in a low-lying coastal region highly exposed to impacts from sea level rise, we observed that land use (explaining more than 50% of model variation) and disturbance metrics (explaining 36% of model variation) were the strongest drivers of fractional carbon declines. Second, although our global regression model indicated sea level rise metrics contributed minimally to the overall explanatory power of the model (explaining only 6.8% of model variation), our local regression model identified places on the landscape where these metrics played a strong and significant role in fractional carbon declines. Finally, our results indicate that by 2090, the study area could lose approximately 8.6 TgC of aboveground carbon because of inundation from sea level rise, with the remaining landscape experiencing, on average, 32% fractional declines in carbon. By measuring coastal forest degradation via aboveground carbon storage, we provide an important link to ecosystem services. Because communities may have diverse values for coastal forests, understanding when, where, and how ecosystem services in coastal forests are changing helps managers prioritize resources for management, adaptation, and restoration of coastal ecosystems [84]. Management decisions must consider these trade-offs among ecosystem services as well as current and future susceptibility to land use modifications and sea level rise.Our approach quantified drivers of coastal forest decline in a spatially explicit way, highlighting the ways that human land use activities, climate, and natural disturbances can act synergistically to alter coastal forest structure and function. By mapping the spatially varying relationships between drivers and carbon declines, we identified geographic locations best suited for targeted management activities. However, to fully understand how these management activities will be implemented, and through what mechanisms, we need a greater understanding of landowner preferences, their evaluation of trade-offs among ecosystem services, their behaviors, and risk perceptions. These are requisite for reducing the uncertainty in coastal forest persistence as sea levels rise.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
13,"The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis Muell.), which is widely planted in tropical regions such as Southeast Asia and the tropical region of China, is of great importance in producing natural rubber and in providing timber when the rubber latex harvest is finished [1,2]. The establishment of new rubber plantations—usually converted from old rubber plantations, tropical forest, and cropland [3]—and timber harvesting in old rubber plantations will greatly alter the carbon budget [4]. Therefore, accurately estimating biomass, which is an important indicator of the carbon storage capacity and the potential carbon pool size of a forest ecosystem [5,6], is a widespread concern of ecologists, plantation managers, and policy makers related to the rubber industry.The biomass of rubber plantations at a plot level is usually estimated by allometric equation (AE) models, linked with field measurements of the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and Height (H), or a combination of other factors, such as the stand age and wood density [7,8,9,10,11]. In China, four rubber biomass allometric models have been developed thus far [8,10,12,13]. All these models use DBH or the combination of DBH and H as independent variables, yielding R2 values greater than 0.97. Three of these models were developed in Xishuangbanna prefecture, Yunnan Province [8,10,12], and one was developed in Leizhou Peninsula (close to Hainan island), Guangdong Province [13]. Jia et al.’s [12] model only considers the aboveground biomass but covers biomass variation at low (550–600 m), medium (750–800 m), and high (950–1050 m) elevations above the mean sea level (AMSL), while the other three models consider the belowground biomass [8,10,13]. These AE models are very valuable because the purpose of planting rubber trees is to harvest latex for a long period of time (usually 25–30 years) instead of wood. The cost of felling mature rubber trees in a large area to establish AE models is very high.There are several ways to extend biomass at the tree/plot level to a landscape/regional scale. One of the commonly used methods is to convert tree volume data from forest inventories into biomass using biomass conversion and expansion factors (BCEFs) [14,15,16]. A generalized curve of BCEFs for different species or species groups by stand age and site index has been developed in most countries, such as Poland and China, which signed up for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its supplementary Kyoto Protocol [14,17]. Another approach is to multiply the average or time-averaged biomass obtained at a plot scale by the area in a specific region [11,18]. For example, Petsri et al. [9] calculated the biomass per hectare through a meta-analysis of DBH and H against stand age and then estimated the national rubber biomass in Thailand with annual statistics for area data and a fixed rotation length of 25 years. The accuracy obtained in this way was much better than the result obtained from multiplying the average/time averaged biomass by the total area. However, large uncertainties may exist because the actual age structure is unknown and the rotation length is not fixed at 25 years. In addition, the use of remote sensing to estimate forest biomass over a large area is becoming increasingly popular. Many studies has been conducted to estimate different forest (e.g., broadleaf and coniferous) biomass through optical satellite imagery [19,20,21], the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) [6,22,23], Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) [24,25], or their combination [23,26,27,28,29]. More recently, the European Space Agency planned to launch a fully polarimetric P-band SAR satellite—BIOMASS—for which the main tasks are mapping the global aboveground biomass, forest height, and severe forest disturbances [30]. Generally, LiDAR is the top-ranked approach for forest biomass estimation as it can remove data saturation, followed by longer wavelength radar and optical remote sensing [31]. However, the data availability is the opposite; LiDAR data are the scarcest due to limited satellites carrying LiDAR instruments, and optical remote sensing data are the most abundant.Many studies have used remote sensing to estimate the biomass of rubber plantations. The relationship between rubber biomass, spectral bands, and vegetation indices derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) was explored in Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China, and different biomass models using stepwise regression [32,33] and Random Forest (RF) [34] were developed (R2 = 0.43–0.67 and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 30.27–46.05 Mg/ha). The total rubber biomass in Xishuangbanna was about 1.97 × 107 Mg, and the average biomass was 75.90 Mg/ha [32]. Yasen and Koedsin found that an artificial neural network based on WorldView-2 multispectral imagery could estimate biomass more accurately than stepwise multiple linear regression in Phuket Province, Thailand [2]. Charoenjit et al. [35] first estimated tree girth—using spectral bands, textural parameters, and vegetation indices from Thaichote multispectral imagery by a linear multiple regression model—and then used it with an AE model to estimate the rubber biomass in eastern Thailand. Avtar et al. [36] found that the Horizontal transmitting with Vertical receiving (HV) band of the Phase-Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) positively correlated with the biomass of rubber plantations. The correlation was higher than for the Horizontal transmitting with Horizontal receiving (HH) band, but it began to saturate when the biomass was about 50 Mg/ha. Trisaongko and Paull estimated the biomass of rubber plantations with a very high accuracy (R2 = 0.98 and RMSE = 1.88 Mg/ha), indicating that the acquisition time of PALSAR-2 and the choice of AE model significantly affect the accuracy [37]. By summarizing this literature, two main approaches for estimating the biomass of rubber plantations on a large scale can be obtained: (1) establishing direct relationships between biomass and spectral/SAR bands, vegetation indices, and textural parameters and (2) obtaining proxy factors such as DBH from remote sensing data and then using them as the parameters of AE models. In fact, all these approaches use canopy features from optical or SAR satellite imagery to estimate biomass. As the relationship between rubber biomass and canopy features gradually weakens with an increase in the stand age [38], the estimated biomass of middle-aged and old rubber plantations often exhibits large deviations.There is also a close relationship between rubber biomass and stand age [39]. Good models (R2 = 0.97–0.99) of the biomass/carbon stock of rubber plantations and stand age have been developed in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province [8,40,41] and in Thailand [9]. Compared to DBH, the rubber stand age is easier to acquire accurately from time-series satellite imagery. Thanks to the free access of Landsat data policy [42], the establishment year (same as the stand age) of rubber plantations can be accurately traced back to the end of the 1980s at an annual resolution and RMSE of about 2 years [3,43], demonstrating great potential for biomass estimation. In addition to the stand age, the rubber biomass is also closely related to the geographical environment in which it grows, such as light conditions, soil moisture, and fertility. Differences in the growth condition of rubber plantations may affect the intensity of the spectral reflectance that can be used to estimate the biomass [35]. Therefore, we assume that combining the stand age and spectral characteristics can more accurately estimate the biomass of rubber plantations. The objectives of this study are (1) to explore the relationship between rubber biomass and stand age and LS2-based variables (e.g., spectral bands and vegetation indices); (2) to develop biomass models using stand age and LS2-based variables; and (3) to generate a biomass map of rubber plantations in Hainan Island, China and to investigate its spatial distribution pattern.", 1.

14,"Hainan Island (19°20′N–20°10′N, 108°21′E–111°03′E, Figure 1) is the second largest island in China and has an area of about 3.4 million ha. The topography of the island is mountainous in the interior, with lowlands along the coast. Wuzhi Mountain (1867 m AMSL) is the highest mountain on the island [44]. The climate varies from tropical to subtropical. The annual mean temperature is approximately 23–25 °C, and the monthly temperature varies between approximately 16 °C in January and approximately 30 °C from May to July. The average annual precipitation is 1500 to 2000 mm, about 80% of which occurs during the rainy season from May to October. However, the spatial distribution of precipitation can be as high as 2400 mm in the central and eastern area and as low as 900 mm in the coastal areas of the southwest [45].Hainan Island is the second largest rubber plantation base in China. In the 1950s, a large area of rubber trees was planted to meet China’s national defense and economic needs. Statistics indicate that Hainan Island had about 5.43 × 105 ha of rubber plantations by the end of 2017, accounting for more than a quarter of the total forest area, and is the largest plantation ecosystem there [44].", 2.

15," 2.2.1. Field Inventory DataField data consist of two parts: the main field data sampled in 2016 and supplementary data derived from [38] or collected from the experimental farm of the Chinese Academy of Tropical Agricultural Sciences (CATAS) from 2007 to 2014. The main field data are new and have a uniform acquisition time, so are used to explore the relationship between rubber biomass and remote sensing variables, to develop Random Forest (RF) models, and to evaluate their accuracy. Both the main field data and supplementary data were used to fit a biomass model using the stand age as the independent variable. The supplementary data were mainly collected for increasing samples in the 1990s—a period established with limited rubber plantations, which made it difficult to acquire wealthy field data by random sampling.The main field data were collected in October of 2016 by randomly selecting rubber plantations with the aid of Google high-resolution satellite images. In each plantation, the DBH of each rubber tree at a 1.3 m height in an area of 25 × 25 m was measured, and the mean and standard deviation of the DBH were calculated. The stand age was obtained by interviewing farmers or was evaluated according to the height of tapped bark—a relatively fixed height of bark is consumed each year for latex harvest—and double checked with the plantation establishment year map of 2017 (described in Section 2.3). Field photos were taken by a Casio EX-H20G camera embedded with a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. The GPS information of the photos was extracted using these steps: (1) converting it into a Keyhole Markup Language (KML) file format by PhotoKML (v1.3) (https://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Graphic/Graphic-thers/PhotoKML.shtml), (2) importing the KML file in ArcGIS (v10.2, www.esri.com) and converting it into a shapefile format, and (3) extracting the latitude and longitude of each plot. A total of 51 rubber plantations were collected during the field campaign. The spatial distribution of field plots is shown in Figure 1 and descriptive statistics on the stand age and DBH are presented in Table 1. Among the 18 counties where rubber trees have been cultivated, 16 of them have sampling plots.The DBH and stand age of rubber plantations included in the supplementary data were collected in a similar way, but accurate GPS information of some plantations was not clear. Actually, the stand age is the primary concern when building a stand age-based biomass model. The supplementary data consist of 19 rubber plantations with different stand ages. The total biomass (below + aboveground) for a single rubber tree was calculated by the AE model (Equation (1)) [13]:

On Hainan Island, rubber trees were generally planted at a density of 3 × 7 m or 4 × 5 m in columns and rows, resulting in about 495 trees/ha at the initial stage of plantation establishment. However, the tree density decreased with the year because of typhoons, which frequently hit the island and caused huge damage in the rubber industry [46]. Tree density data of more than 80 state farms (not distinguishing the stand age), from 1952 to 2001, were collected by Hainan State Farm Bureau [47], showing an average density of 381.45 trees/ha. Equation (1) was converted into Equation (2) at a hectare scale by multiplying the average tree density and by dividing it by 1000 (converting kg to Mg):

 is the biomass (Mg/ha). The girth and biomass of each plantation were stored in the attribute table of the shapefile. According to the size of biomass, the field data were split into eight groups (30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 110, and 140 Mg/ha), which were further used as parameters for stratified k-fold cross-validation. Stratified k-fold cross-validation is similar to k-fold cross-validation, but it conducts stratified sampling instead of random sampling to ensure that relative class frequencies are approximately preserved in each train and validation fold. Then, the shapefile was uploaded to the Google Earth Engine (GEE, https://earthengine.google.com/) platform for subsequent analysis and modeling. 2.2.2. Satellite ImageryLandsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery was used in this study. Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery were obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS, www.usgs.gov), and the Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI) imagery was obtained from the European Space Agency (ESA, https://sentinel.esa.int). All the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance data of Landsat 7/8 collection 1 Tier 1 and Sentinel-2 Level-1C were acquired during the day of year (DOY) between 120 and 330 (April 1 to November 30) and from 2016 to 2017. Surface Reflectance (SR) data were not used because Sentinel-2 SR (Level-2A) for the study area was not available at the GEE platform when we first carried out this study, and the mix use of Sentinel-2 TOA and Landsat SR may have the problem of cross-calibration between different sensors. Landsat 7/8 data have a 30-m spatial resolution, and Sentinel-2 MSI has a 10-m spatial resolution. These TOA reflectance data had already been orthorectified with a high geometric accuracy and reduced radiometric uncertainties between different acquisition dates and different sensors, such as ETM+ and OLI. All these data were available on the GEE cloud computing platform and could be readily accessed.The cloud and cloud shadow of Landsat ETM+ and OLI were masked using bitmask information from the associated quality assessment band, which was generated by the widely used C Function of Mask (CFMask) algorithm [48]. Google’s cloudScore algorithm, together with the Temporal Dark Outlier Mask (TDOM), were used for masking the cloud and shadow of Sentinel imagery [49,50]. Regression models [50] were used to minimize TOA reflectance differences among the sensors of Sentinel-2 MSI, Landsat 7 ETM+, and Landsat 8 OLI, using Landsat 8 OLI TOA reflectance as a benchmark.A median value composite (similar to a maximum value composite [51], but the median value in each band over time was selected) was applied to Landsat 7/8 and Sentinel-2 (LS2) to generate 20-m resolution cloud-free imagery. Then, two commonly used vegetation indices—the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [52] and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) [53]—were calculated using Equations (3) and (4), respectively:

Previous studies indicated that principal component analysis (PCA) of Landsat images had stronger relationship with forest biomass than individual bands [31]. Therefore, PCA was computed based on the LS2 composite image. 2.2.3. Terrain DataThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation data (V3) at a resolution of 1 arc-second (approximately a 30-m spatial resolution) were provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) [54].

Then, two commonly used vegetation indices—the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [52] and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) [53]—were calculated using Equations (3) and (4), respectively:

19,"Most AE biomass models are built on DBH, H, or their combination [12,13]. However, the biomass of rubber plantations also displays a close relationship with stand age—the R2 of the established biomass model exceeds 0.93 [8,18]. A stand age-based biomass model is more popular in the remote sensing community because the stand age can be estimated more accurately by dense time-series satellite images than DBH or H [3,43], which are more easily and precisely obtained on the ground. In addition to the stand age, factors such as geography and climatic will affect the growth, meaning that rubber plantations of the same age have different canopy characteristics and biomasses. We made a hypothesis that integrating the stand age and spectral signatures from satellite imagery acquired in the growing season (April to December) can improve the estimation accuracy of the biomass model. Two methods were used to estimate the biomass of rubber plantations, and their differences were compared. The first was a regression model solely fitted by stand age, and the second was a Random Forest (RF) model built on LS2-based variables and/or the stand age. To generate a wall-to-wall biomass map of Hainan Island, both models require a reliable stand age map of rubber plantations in advance. 2.3.1. Mapping the Stand Age of Rubber PlantationsIn a previous study, we developed a new algorithm to identify the establishment year (same as the stand age, where the stand age equals the target year minus the establishment year) of rubber plantations based on all Landsat images of Hainan Island [3]. Specifically, signatures that topsoil exposed during plantation establishment and canopy closure linearly increased during nonproductive periods (rubber seedling to mature plantations) were employed to identify the establishment year. Annual images of the minimum and average Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) from 1987 to 2015 were respectively composited from all Landsat images (about 2000 scenes in total) acquired in the growing season of the corresponding year and were then used to generate an establishment year map of rubber plantations for Hainan Island in 2015. The establishment year map at an annual resolution since 1987 shows a very high accuracy (R2 = 0.85/0.99 and RMSE = 2.34/0.54 year at a pixel/plantation scale). The establishment year established before 1987 was uniformly set as 1986 because the earliest collection of Landsat 5 imagery of Hainan Island started in 1987. We used the same algorithm and thresholds to generate the stand age map in 2017, using the newly obtained map of rubber plantations in 2017 as a benchmark and adding annual composited images of 2016 and 2017 to the previous annual composited data set. 2.3.2. Regression Biomass ModelBoth the main field data (51 plots) and supplementary field data (19 plots) were used to build a regression biomass model. The field data used were obtained from rubber plantations of less than 30 years old. It is difficult to accurately obtain a stand age of over 30 years from both remote sensing and ground surveys—the former case is because of a lack of time-series images for mapping (the earliest collection of Landsat 5 images of Hainan Island began in 1987), while the latter case is due to difficulties in determining the stand age from blurred tapping bark of old trees. The biomass was grouped according to stand age, and their average and standard deviation values were calculated. The stand age was used as the independent variable, and the average biomass was the dependent variable.

. 2.3.3. Random Forest (RF) Biomass ModelThe RF machine learning algorithm is generally immune to data noise and overfitting [55] and has been widely used within the remote sensing community such as classification [56,57,58,59], biomass estimation [25,60], disease monitoring [61,62], and hazards detection [63]. The good performance of the RF model over other methods, such as maximum likelihood and single decision trees, has been demonstrated by many studies and was summarized by Belgiu et al. [64].Three tests were conducted during RF model building: (1) biomass saturation (sensitivity to biomass is lost up to a point) with different variables from LS2 composite images, (2) model building using LS2-based variables, and (3) model building using LS2-based variables and the stand age. Based on previous studies on forest biomass [31], we selected variables such as B3, B4, B5, B7, PC1, PC2, PC3, NDVI, and EVI to construct an independent variable data set. A scatter plot and the Pearson correlation coefficient between different variables and biomass were used to assess the biomass saturation. We calculated multiple correlation coefficients using samples of different biomass sizes, starting from 40 Mg/ha, with 5 Mg/ha as the step until 80 Mg/ha.Every possible variable combination by gradually adding a distinct variable from the independent variable set—B3 and B4, and B3 and B5 as combination examples—was used to build RF models. We also tested the model performance under conditions of with/without stand age as a fixed independent variable. We kept the best 10 RF models each time and finally compared their performance under different variable combinations. Considering the problem of biomass saturation, model building was also conducted for samples from different biomass groups (smaller than mean values of 50, 60, 70, 80, 110, and 140 Mg/ha, respectively). Due to the limited sample size, we did not perform model testing on samples with a biomass of less than 50 Mg/ha, even using k-fold cross-validation (K = 4 was used here). In order to improve the efficiency of the test, we downloaded the sample data containing LS2-based variables from GEE to a local computer and then used the scikit-learn (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) python package for model testing.

26,"R2 of the best RF models developed by variable combinations of B3, B4, B5, B7, PC1, PC2, PC3, NDVI, and EVI ranges from 0.38 to 0.81, and the RMSE is between 4.31 and 24.34 Mg/ha (Figure 5). The RF model trained with samples of less than or equal to group 50 (specifically, all samples with a biomass < 55 Mg/ha) holds the highest R2 (0.81) and lowest RMSE (4.31 Mg/ha). R2 decreases to about 0.65 when sample groups less than 60, 70, and 80 are used for modeling and then gradually decreases to about 0.38 when the samples of a higher biomass (groups 110 and 140) are added to the models. However, the RMSE of the RF models generally increases from 4.31 to 24.34 Mg/ha with the addition samples of a higher biomass.When the stand age is a fixed independent variable, the prediction accuracies of RF models are significantly improved. R2 ranges from 0.81 to 0.96, and the RMSE is between 4.08 and 10.59 Mg/ha (Figure 5). The accuracy of the RF model built with samples of less than and equal to the 50 group is the highest, where R2 reaches 0.96 (0.15 higher than that without using the stand age) and RMSE drops to 4.08 Mg/ha. When the sample biomass is high, the increase in R2 is more obvious. For example, R2 of a model built with samples of less than or equal to the 140 group increases from 0.38 to 0.85 and the RMSE decreases from 24.34 to 10.59 Mg/ha. The RMSE of the RF models generally increases with the addition of higher biomass samples.The scatter plot of the best RF model developed by stand age and LS2-based variables with k-fold cross-validation is shown in Figure 4b. The points are more densely distributed near the 1-to-1 line when the biomass of rubber plantations is less than about 65 Mg/ha, and most points are then more scattered afterwards. The R2, RMSE, and slope of the fit line are 0.70, 16.41 Mg/ha, and 0.78, respectively. A slight underestimation is observed for plantations which exhibit a higher biomass.Since the RF models have a higher prediction accuracy for plantations with a lower biomass (Figure 5) and the regression model presents a high accuracy for plantations with a higher biomass (Figure 4a), a hybrid model integrating the optimal results of these two models can better predict the accuracy.

27,"The establishment year map of rubber plantations on Hainan Island by the end of 2017 is shown in Figure 6a. Immature plantations with a stand age of less than four years were excluded from this map because of larger mapping uncertainties. Rubber plantations are densely distributed in northern and center-to-east regions. Danzhou city possesses the largest area of rubber plantations, whilst other counties, such as Baisha, Chengmai, Qiongzhong, and Qionghai, also have dense distributions. The establishment year map shows an interesting distribution: A considerable number of rubber plantations have been established in the western and northern regions since 2000, whereas the old rubber plantations are mainly distributed along the coastal strip from south to northeast.The spatial distribution of the biomass of rubber plantations generated by the hybrid model is shown in Figure 6b. The spatial distribution pattern is quite consistent with the spatial distribution of the establishment year. The biomass of newly established rubber plantations in the western and northern regions is generally below 60 Mg/ha, while the biomass of aging plantations distributed along the coastal strip from south to northeast and some border regions such as Danzhou city and Baisha county usually exceeds 110 Mg/ha. The biomass of some rubber plantations discretely distributed in Danzhou city and counties of Baisha and Qiongzhong is greater than 90 Mg/ha.The average biomass of rubber plantations varies in different counties or cities (Figure 7a). Wanning city possesses an average biomass of about 105 Mg/ha and tops the rankings, followed by the cities of Qionghai, Haikou, Wenchang, Sanya, and Wuzhishan, all of which have an average biomass of about 100 Mg/ha. Baoting county has an average biomass of about 95 Mg/ha, followed by the counties of Dingan, Qiongzhong, and Ledong, possessing an average biomass that is slightly greater than 90 Mg/ha. The average biomass of Danzhou city, representing the largest production base on Hainan Island, is about 80 Mg/ha. Changjiang and Lingao county exhibit the lowest values among the 18 counties or cities, displaying an average biomass of about 72 Mg/ha.The total biomass of rubber plantations varies dramatically among different counties or cities (Figure 7b). Danzhou city possesses a total biomass of 9.77 × 106 Mg, which is far higher than other counties or cities, followed by the counties of Baisha, Qiongzhong, Chengmai, and Qionghai city, all of which have a total biomass of rubber plantations greater than 4.50 × 106 Mg. The total biomasses of rubber plantations in Tunchang county, Wanning city, Ledong county, Dinan city, and Lingao county are about 3.21 × 106, 3.05 × 106, 2.78 × 106, 2.59 × 106, and 2.45 × 106, respectively, while the remaining counties or cities have values of less than 2.00 × 106 Mg. Dongfang city and Lingshui county have the smallest biomass of rubber plantations, possessing values of 6.88 × 105 and 6.37 × 105 Mg, respectively. The total biomass of rubber plantations on Hainan Island in 2017 was 5.40 × 107 Mg.The average biomass of rubber plantations varies greatly at different elevations and slopes (Figure 8a,b). The highest average biomass is located at an elevation between 200 and 300 m, which is about 93 Mg/ha, followed by rubber plantations distributed in an elevation range from 300 to 400 m and from 400 to 600 m. The lowest average biomass is located at an elevation between 50 to 100 m, which is about 85 Mg/ha. In areas with a slope below 12 degrees, the average biomass of rubber plantations increases with an increase in the slope, gradually increasing from about 83 Mg/ha within five degrees to about 94 Mg/ha at regions of 8–12 degrees. After the slope exceeds 12 degrees, the average biomass of rubber plantations is maintained at about 96 Mg/ha.The total biomass of rubber plantations on Hainan Island is mainly distributed in low elevation and flat areas (Figure 8c,d). At an elevation of 100 to 200 m, the total rubber biomass is the highest, exceeding 2.16 × 107 Mg, followed by areas of 50 to 100 and 200 to 300 m, with values of about 1.31 × 107 Mg and 8.95 × 106 Mg, respectively. The total biomass in areas above a 600-m elevation is extremely low. The total biomass of rubber plantations gradually decreases with an increasing slope. In flat areas of less than five degrees, the total biomass is close to 2.28 × 107 Mg, followed by areas of 5–8 degrees, for which the total biomass is 1.12 × 107 Mg.", 3. Results, 3.4. The Spatial Distribution of Rubber Plantations and Biomass,3
28,"Many studies have reported that the saturation point between the biomass of rubber plantations and different variables from remote sensing was very low. In this study, the saturation point of rubber plantations with B3, B4, B5, B7, PC1, PC2, PC3, NDVI, and EVI from LS2-based composite images was about 65 Mg/ha, which was higher than in studies conducted in Cambodia [36] and Thailand [2]. Avtar et al. [36] found that the PALSAR HV band positively correlated with the aboveground biomass of rubber plantations but was saturated at 50 Mg/ha. Yasen and Koedsin [2] found that the aboveground biomass of rubber plantations was saturated with WorldView-2 images at 40 Mg/ha in Phuket Province, Thailand. The main reason for the higher saturation point we monitored was that it contains belowground biomass. If the underground biomass was deducted at a rate of 20% [13], the saturation point of the aboveground biomass was also around 50 Mg/ha, which was consistent with these studies. Since the most LS2-based variables were saturated when the rubber biomass was very low, it was difficult to accurately estimate the biomass of rubber plantations from these variables. For example, only one model we developed using samples less than 55 Mg/ha had an R2 of 0.81. The R2 of other models built on samples with a biomass of less than 85 Mg/ha was about 0.65 and decreased to 0.38 when all samples were used for modeling (Figure 5a).", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Biomass Saturation with Different LS2-Based Variables,4
29,"The regression biomass model fitted by stand age had a high accuracy (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 7.12 Mg/ha), which was consistent with previous studies [8,10,18]. The high accuracy of the model could be explained by the fact that rubber plantations have a shorter economic life cycle (about 25–30 years). The growth of biomass only became slow after more than 20 years [38], so the biomass had a close relationship with stand age. The maximum biomass from this regression model (145.40 Mg/ha) was similar to studies such as [9,65], reporting 63.70 and 65.10 Mg C/ha of carbon stock for rubber plantations with rotation periods of 38 and 25 years, respectively. However, this value was much higher than the value from Trisasongko’s model—the maximum biomass of a 30-year-old rubber plantation was about 70 Mg/ha [37]. In addition to stand age, the planting density also affects biomass accumulation greatly [10]. We have incorporated planting density in the regression model, according to 50 years of extensive surveys from Hainan State Farm Bureau.Obtaining a high-precision stand age map was essential for estimating the biomass of rubber plantations over a large area. Currently, most studies use one or several satellite images to estimate stand age, obtaining a stand age map of different age groups (e.g., <7, 5–15, and >15) [66,67,68]. In this study, the stand age map of rubber plantations in 2017 was generated at annual steps using all LS2 images acquired from 1987 to 2017 and a novelty algorithm developed in a previous study [3]. With this reliable stand age map, the biomass map through the regression model of Hainan Island exhibited high accuracy (R2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 14.00 Mg/ha), better than models without the stand age—for example, higher than the regression model (R2 = 0.43) developed in Cambodia [36]; artificial network model (R2 = 0.66 and RMSE = 11.97 Mg/ha) established in Phuket Province, Thailand [2]; and RF model (R2 = 0.43 and RMSE = 34.05 Mg/ha) built in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China [34]. Using an accurate stand age map and models, the wall-to-wall biomass map could be obtained. Theoretically, this method was superior to the traditional BCEF approach since it was difficult to establish a yearly scale conversion factor [14].In addition to the stand age, signatures from satellite images contributed to the improvement of biomass estimation. However, the model built based on all samples had a large estimation bias especially in plantations which have higher biomass (Figure 4b) because the biomass of rubber plantations was saturated at around 65 Mg/ha (Figure 2). Previous research also found a similar estimation bias. For example, Yasen and Koedsin [2] found that the artificial neural network model was seriously underestimated after the biomass of rubber plantations exceeded about 50 Mg/ha, and Wang et al. [34] found that the stepwise regression model showed severe underestimation after 200 Mg/ha. The estimation bias issue in the RF model could be solved by replacing the prediction results of aging plantations (biomass of over 65 Mg/ha) with corresponding results from the regression model (estimated solely by stand age). R2 of the hybrid model was improved from 0.79 to 0.83, and the RMSE was decreased from 14.00 to 12.48 Mg/ha (Figure 4b).RF was widely used and proven to have a higher prediction accuracy than other algorithms because of its many advantages, such as the fact that it is not sensitive to noise or overtraining and requires less computational resources [69]. In this study, RF also showed a high prediction accuracy. For example, the R2 of RF models developed with samples of biomass less than 85 Mg/ha and LS2-based variables reached about 0.65, although the biomass of rubber plantations was saturated at about 65 Mg/ha. However, as reported in previous studies [64], the RF model was also very sensitive to the sample design. Initially, we randomly divided the samples into training and validation sets, but the estimation accuracy was quite low because sample sizes of different age groups varied greatly. After we adopted the stratified k-fold cross-validation method, the accuracy and stability of the RF models improved greatly since more samples could be used for modeling and cross-validation. In addition, cross-sensor calibration among LS2 images also promoted high accuracy of RF models since the differences in band values among MSI, ETM+, and OLI were significant for all cross-sensor band pairs [50]. In the future, more data sources, such as PALSAR-2 radar data, and more influence factors, such as the altitude and slope, can be included to further improve the prediction accuracy of the models. For example, terrain factors affect not only the light and temperature environment of the forest plantations but also the signal strength of remote sensing, which is used for modeling [22].", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Biomass Estimation Using Stand Age and Remote Sensing Parameters,4
30,"Rubber plantations account for more than one fourth of the total forest area on Hainan Island and are the largest forest plantation ecosystem there. Therefore, it is of vital importance to evaluate their biomass at a province scale. The average rubber biomass for the island is 90.53 Mg/ha, which is higher than the 83.25 Mg/ha [33] and 75.90 ± 58.75 Mg/ha [32] values estimated in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China. The main reason for the higher average biomass is the introduction of stand age during model building, which greatly reduced the signal saturation problem commonly encountered in the remote sensing community. The average rubber biomass was smaller than 108.35 ± 11.48 Mg/ha in 14-year-old plantations at a low elevation but higher than 79.71 ± 14.48 Mg/ha in plantations of the same age at a medium elevation in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, China [12].Since many rubber plantations were established after 2003, the biomass density in the northern and western areas of Hainan Island was relatively low and was mostly less than 75 Mg/ha (Figure 6). Danzhou city, which is the largest rubber production base on Hainan Island, is mixed with plenty of young and aging rubber plantations, leading to a higher average biomass (about 80 Mg/ha) than that of Lingao county (about 71 Mg/ha, representing the lowest average biomass), where most rubber plantations were established after 2003 (Figure 7). The highest biomass density along the coastal strip from south to northeast (e.g., the average biomass in the cities of Sanya, Wanning, Qionghai, and Wenchang is about 100 Mg/ha, Figure 7) can be explained by the large number of aging rubber plantations there. It was previously found that farmers were no longer willing to plant rubber trees in these regions, frequently hit by severe typhoons [46,70], even if the natural rubber price was rising rapidly. The expansion trend of rubber plantations in the western and northern areas was very obvious, leading to great changes in the biomass spatial pattern. However, rubber plantations have not expanded to high elevations and steep areas in the past few decades, so the average biomass in areas with a slope higher than 12 degrees has hardly changed, and the total biomass is concentrated in areas 400 m above sea level (Figure 8). Our previous study indicated that a large number of rubber plantations converted from cropland were concentrated in the northwestern part, which has relatively low elevations (Figure 1) and a large amount of flat cropland [3], causing a very low average biomass in low elevation and flat areas (Figure 8). The total biomass of rubber plantations by the end of 2017 was 5.40 × 107 Mg, which is equivalent to 2.70 × 107 Mg carbon if 0.5 is taken as the conversion factor [9].", 4. Discussion, 4.3.

31,"There are several factors affecting the estimation accuracy of rubber plantation biomass, including the accuracy of the stand age map, landscape fragmentation, and the tree density. 4.4.1. The Accuracy of the Stand Age MapAlthough we used all LS2 images and an algorithm based on changes of land use and the biophysical canopy of rubber plantations to generate the stand age map [3], there are still many uncertainties, especially for plantations established before 2000—a stage of acquiring a limited number of images from the Landsat 5 satellite. In addition, the establishment year of rubber plantations established earlier than 1987 was uniformly set to 1986, leading to an underestimation of the stand age and biomass (estimated by the regression model). 4.4.2. Landscape FragmentationDue to the strong interference from human activities, rubber plantation patches were quite small and often mixed with different crop patches. The severely fragmented landscape has brought many difficulties to the accurate mapping rubber plantations and their stand age [3]. This is why we used a single pixel instead of the average value of the 3 × 3 pixel window of the field data for modeling. 4.4.3. Tree DensityDue to being frequently affected by severe typhoons, the tree density of rubber plantations on Hainan Island gradually decreases as the stand age increases [46,70]. However, we could not establish a model of the tree density and stand age because of the lack of abundant field data. Instead, a fixed density of 381.45 trees/ha, according to field data collected by Hainan State Farm Bureau, was used to estimate the biomass of rubber plantations. This tree density was smaller than the 418.99 tree/ha value used in Thailand, which is rarely hit by typhoons [9]. Using a fixed tree density underestimates the biomass of young and middle-aged plantations but overestimates the biomass of aged plantations. However, the biomass of rubber plantations established before 1987 was underestimated due to the underestimation of stand age (uniformly set to 1986), which, to some extent, offsets the overestimated biomass of old rubber plantations.", 4.

35,"Biomass is a crucial variable for estimating the carbon storage capacity and the potential carbon pool size of a forest ecosystem. It is of great importance to estimate the biomass of rubber plantations that are widely distributed in tropical regions. Our results show that the biomass of rubber plantations is closely related to stand age and that R2 of the stand age-based biomass model (regression model) can reach 0.97. When the biomass of plantations is small, they are closely related to the LS2-based variables, especially B3, B7, PC2, and NDVI, and the absolute value of most correlation coefficients is around 0.55. However, the biomass of rubber plantations is saturated with all LS2-based variables at around 65 Mg/ha. Combined with the annual-scale high-precision map of the rubber stand age in 2017 and regression model, the biomass of rubber plantations on Hainan Island was estimated with a satisfactory accuracy (BRG, R2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 14.00 Mg/ha). However, the hybrid model with joint results of regression and RF models has a higher accuracy and low estimation bias (BRG + RF, R2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 12.48 Mg/ha). The introduction of stand age into the models significantly solved the problem of biomass saturation, which occurs at about 65 Mg/ha with satellite-based signatures.The results showed that there were a large number of rubber plantations with a low biomass distributed in the western and northern areas of Hainan Island, usually below 75 Mg/ha, because of rapid expansion since 2003. High-biomass rubber plantations were mainly distributed in the inner region of the coastal strip from south to northeast, which have frequently suffered from severe typhoons in the past few decades. For example, the average biomass of rubber plantations in Wanning city, southeast of Hainan Island, was close to 105 Mg/ha, ranking top among all cities and counties. Danzhou city, representing the largest rubber production base on Hainan Island, possessed the largest total biomass of 9.77 × 106 Mg, followed by Baisha and Qiongzhong counties. The total biomass of rubber plantations on Hainan Island by the end of 2017 was 5.40 × 107 Mg, indicating a great carbon pool there. The maps of stand age and biomass are of great value for regional carbon budget evaluation and can assist in the development of sustainable management policies to maximize the potential benefits of rubber tree resources.", 5.

36,"In recent years, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tomography (TomoSAR) has become a popular research topic due to its 3-D imaging capability [1,2,3,4,5,6]. TomoSAR has been successfully applied in many application contexts, such as forestry [7,8], 3D urban reconstruction [9,10], and glaciers [11]. The single-pass multi-baseline TomoSAR system has 3D resolution including the height resolving ability in a single-pass platform because there are multiple channels in the cross-track direction. However, the Rayleigh resolution in the height direction is very limited due to the limitation of the baseline length in a single-pass platform. As shown in Equation (25), the Rayleigh resolution of a TomoSAR system is about 35 m. If super-resolution performance is desired in the height direction, at a resolution of, say, 5 m, then a super-resolution algorithm must be introduced in that direction so as to distinguish multiple targets in small intervals within the Rayleigh resolution. Tebaldini [11] concludes that even a subwavelength accuracy of the antenna phase center (APC) position will hinder the focusing result in the height direction. The authors of [12] conclude that, when one wants to distinguish multiple point-like targets with different heights within a slant range-azimuth resolution cell, the requirements for phase stability or phase calibration accuracy are higher than those for traditional InSAR. Therefore, if we hope to obtain a super-resolution performance in the height direction, high requirements for the channel imbalance (also known as amplitude and phase inconsistency) and APC position calibration are required in a single-pass multi-baseline TomoSAR system.Several calibration algorithms have been proposed in recent years. Pardini [13] calibrated the phase error due to APC position by an algorithm based on a minimum entropy criterion. In [14], Gocho compensates for the phase screen caused by APC position errors using eigenvalue decomposition and phase interpolation/extrapolation. However, these two methods cannot obtain the exact APC position, and they fail to take channel imbalance into account. A phase center double localization algorithm is proposed by Tebaldini [11,15] to obtain the APC position. However, this method loses its effectiveness when there is channel imbalance. A different method has been proposed in [16], which estimates the APC position based on raw data. Such processing seems infeasible for users with single-look complex (SLC) images only. Regarding the correction of amplitude and phase errors in multi-channel array systems, Kuoye Han [17] proposes a calibrator-based approach. On the basis of [17], Xiaolin Yang takes into account both channel imbalance and APC position in [18], but they failed to decouple the phase errors caused by the channel itself and the APC position. In general, these calibration algorithms above either do not consider both the channel imbalance and the APC position or are unable to decouple channel imbalance and the APC position error. In addition, a plane wave model is used in most of these algorithms. However, even in the far-field condition, the plane wave model will bring some non-negligible phase error when the ratio of the baseline length to line-of-sight distance is not sufficiently close to zero [19]. As an example, Figure 6 will show that the plane wave model brings a non-negligible phase error even in the far-field condition, where b = 0.6 m and r = 1625 m. Therefore, we use the Fresnel approximation, which assumes that spherical waves can be approximated by quadratic waves in our signal model.In this paper, we propose a unified algorithm for the channel imbalance and APC position calibration of a single-pass multi-baseline TomoSAR system, which can not only calibrate channel imbalance but can also calibrate the APC position. Features of this algorithm are as follows: (1) the channel imbalance and APC position can be calibrated individually rather than confusing the phase error caused by the APC position error with the phase error of the channel itself; (2) the Fresnel approximation is used in the calibration signal model, which heightens the accuracy of the calibration signal model; and (3) there is no need for phase unwrapping.This paper is structured as follows. Section 2 is devoted to establishing a signal model. The proposed calibration algorithm is described in Section 3. The effectiveness of the calibration algorithm is validated in Section 4 with a real data set acquired by the array InSAR system [20,21] developed by the Institute of Electronics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IECAS). The discussion and conclusions follow in Section 5 and Section 6, respectively. ", 1. Introduction,None,1.

39,"After solving the APC position calibration problem, Equation (13) is solved in order to retrieve the channel imbalance. The diagonal element of the calibration matrix is the estimation of the channel imbalance. Non-diagonal elements are actually mutual coupling factors. In general, the mutual coupling factor is relatively small if the channels are spaced out far enough. In particular, the correction matrix will have some characteristics when the multi-channels array has some regular geometry. For example, the calibration matrix of the equidistant line array is the Toeplitz matrix. ", 3. The Calibration Algorithm, 3.2. Step 2: Channel Imbalance Calibration,3
40,"The simulation data is necessary since it makes it possible to directly compare the true channel imbalance and the APC position with those yielded by the calibration algorithm. This test would be quite hard to implement using real data, for which the true channel imbalance and APC position are, in general, not known with sufficient precision. The simulation data set consists of 8-channel 2-D focused SAR SLC images. Eight APCs corresponding to the eight-channel were distributed in the cross-track direction, and the longest baseline is 0.6 m. In this section, we will begin by showing a special case of the simulation data set in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. A Monte Carlo simulation is then carried out to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm in a statistical framework.In the special case, eight APC trajectories—equally spaced out in the cross-track direction—are shown in Figure 3. Amplitude and phase inconsistency are set as AmpErr = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] and PhaseErr = [0, 0.3, 0.1, −0.2, 0.3, 0.1, 1, 0.4] rad. Other relevant system parameters are summarized in Table 1.The observation scene includes 


3
×
11


 non-layover GCPs, and four pairs of layover GCPs spaced out with super-resolution factors of 0.5, 1, 2, and 8, respectively. The super-resolution factor [4] is defined as the ratio of the Rayleigh resolution and layover scatters’ interval. The observation scene’s 2-D SAR image of the simulation data set is depicted in Figure 4. When taking a look at the 2-D SAR image in Figure 4, one can see that all non-layover GCPs are included in the imaging area and are well focused, and that four pairs of layover GCPs in red circles are appropriate superpositions, as expected.After being coregistered to Channel 1 (the reference channel) with sub-pixel accuracy, the calibration algorithm proposed in this paper was carried out by utilizing all 33 non-layover GCPs. After calibration, we obtained the calibration values of the channel imbalance and APC position (see Figure 5). The true values of the channel imbalance and APC position are compared with the calibration values in order to verify the validity of the calibration algorithm. In Figure 5, the true values and calibration values are drawn in red and blue lines, respectively. Graphs in the left panel show the true and calibration values in contrast, while the differences (estimation errors) between them are plotted in the right panel. One can immediately note that the APC position estimation results are very accurate. The maximum and standard deviation are 0.16 mm and 0.105 mm, respectively. The maximum error of amplitude is only −30 dB. The maximum and standard deviation of the phase error are 0.12 rad and 0.06 rad, respectively. This seems a little disappointing because the maximum phase error is not as highly accurate as expected. An additional step, which can be helpful for improving the phase calibration accuracy, involves checking the same GCP in all channels or averaging the results of multiple GCPs, because we have obtained the exact APC position after the previous calibration. In order to examine the effectiveness of this calibration values, a comparison experiment was performed on four pairs of layover GCPs. The true values and the estimation results of the target number and height are listed in Table 2.As shown in Table 2, each pair of layover GCPs is correctly identified as being two targets within the slant range-azimuth resolution cell after calibration. After calibration, the height of each target is also accurately estimated. Prior to calibration, however, the situation is disappointing, since not only the height estimation but even the estimate of the target number is wrong. A precise performance assessment of the proposed algorithm has been carried out by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The systems parameters are the same as those in Table 1. The true APC positions, amplitude inconsistency, and phase inconsistency are modeled as follows:

One hundred trials were carried out. For each trial, the mean and standard deviation of the calibration errors (amplitude and phase) are calculated. Then, results of the different trials are averaged. The mean and standard deviation of calibration errors are shown in Table 3. The calibration error of amplitude is below −30 dB in nearly all trials. As for the calibration error of the phase, the standard deviation is less than 0.06 rad. Regarding the calibration error of APC position, it is computed via averaging the RMSE of all trials, where

 represent the calibration errors of the APC position in the cross-track and height directions, respectively, in the ith trial. The simulation result shows that the calibration error of the APC position is less than 0.127 mm. Based on these simulation results, it can be concluded that the proposed algorithm performs well.", 3. The Calibration Algorithm, 3.3. Validation with Simulation Data,3
41,"In this section, we will validate the effectiveness of the calibration algorithm by using a real data set acquired by the array InSAR system. The array InSAR system was developed by IECAS in 2014, usually installed onboard a Y-12 aircraft. The radar system operates at 15 GHz (Ku-band), and has eight channels in the cross-track direction. Other system parameters are the same as those in Table 1. As a multi-baseline system, the array InSAR system can obtain 3-D images of the observed scene in a single-pass platform. The Rayleigh resolution [5] in the height direction of the array InSAR system can be derived approximately as

where 

λ

 represents the wavelength, the slant range

 is 1625 m, and the off-nadir angle 

θ

 is 38°. Super-resolution techniques must be used since many targets are under 35 m in height; if not, TomoSAR would be meaningless, especially in urban monitoring and mountain mapping tasks. The utilization of a super-resolution technique can achieve high resolution in the height direction, but it is based on the premise that the channel imbalance and APC position are precisely known. Therefore, calibration is particularly important.It is clear in Figure 6 that, under the system parameters described above, the quadratic wave model is more accurate than the plane wave model, and that is why we use the Fresnel approximation in our signal model. The real SAR data set used in this section was acquired by the array InSAR system in April 2015. The calibration site is located in Yuncheng county in the province of Shanxi; its SLC image of Channel 1 is shown in Figure 7. In this single-pass airborne TomoSAR campaign, images of nine GCPs and layover scenes, such as urban buildings, have been acquired. This provides valuable data for our subsequent calibration and validation experiments.", 4. Experimental Results, 4.1. Data Acquisition,4
42,"Three special scenes, including a flat ground, non-layover GCP, and layover building, were selected to verify the effectiveness of the unified calibration algorithm. The chosen flat ground is located at the calibration site with an altitude of about 550 m. The 3-D image of this flat ground should be like a horizontal plane. The selected GCPs are trihedral corner reflectors with a leg length of 20 cm, which are placed at a non-layover area; there should be only one target in the height slice for each non-layover GCP. As for the chosen building, serious layover phenomena appear due to the SAR side view principle. Note that there are a maximum of three layover points in a slant range-azimuth resolution cell of the chosen building. Figure 8 shows SLC images of the chosen scenes and corresponding optical images.", 4. Experimental Results, 4.2. Validation Data Description,4
43,"The calibration processing of the channel imbalance and APC position was carried out as discussed in Section 3. Nine GCPs were used in the calibration site. The results shown in Figure 9 are the channel imbalance and APC position calibration results (blue line) of the array InSAR system campaign from April 2015. The nominal values of the APC position are depicted by a red line. Figure 9a,b show the nominal values and the calibration values of the APC position. The difference between the nominal values and calibration values may be due to the fact that the nominal values are obtained by rough measurement, which is not guaranteed to perfectly correspond to the electromagnetic phase center of the antenna. Figure 9c shows the amplitude difference between different channels. Channel 2 appears slightly smaller than the other channels. We found that the estimate amplitude consistency of each channel is similar to the amplitude calibration results in Figure 9c when the power of the same GCP is extracted in different channels. As the true phase inconsistency and APC position cannot be exactly known, special scenes were chosen to verify the effectiveness of the calibration results in Figure 9. As we shall see later, the 3D imaging results in Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the correctness of the calibration results.In order to verify whether the calibration values are correct, TomoSAR focusing experiments were carried out for two non-layover GCPs, for flat ground and for a layover building; they are described above. In these experiments, a compressive sensing ()-based TomoSAR spectral estimation algorithm—SL1MMER [4]—was used in the imaging of the height direction. Note that SL1MMER can only achieve the best super-resolution power if the parameters are precisely known. Therefore, the more accurate the parameter calibration is, the better the imaging and resolving power in the height direction will be.● GCP ResultsFigure 10 shows the TomoSAR focusing results in the height slice of GCPs. The APC calibration only means that we only compute the estimation values of the APC position by means of a phase center double localization (PCDL) algorithm [11]. The channel imbalance calibration only means that we only compute the estimation results of the channel imbalance by means of the algorithm proposed in [18]. It is apparent that the TomoSAR focusing results of the unified calibration are more accurate in the target number and position estimation and have less disturbance points than the results of the APC calibration only or the results of the channel imbalance calibration only. The heights of the two chosen GCPs are 550.93 m and 552.79 m, respectively. The reconstructed heights obtained by utilizing the unified algorithm proposed in this paper are 551.06 m and 552.75 m, which is very close to the true heights. However, the results of the other methods are not satisfactory. This is not difficult to understand, as the phase error caused by the channel imbalance and APC position error would result in disturbance points and the target position offset.● Flat Ground ValidationFigure 11 shows the 3D imaging results of the selected flat ground. The 3D imaging results of the unified calibration algorithm (see Figure 11c,f) are almost clustered on a plane, but the results of the APC calibration only and channel imbalance only are scattered, which is inconsistent with the actual flat terrain. It can therefore be said that the 3D imaging quality is improved by utilizing the system parameters calibrated by the proposed unified algorithm.● Layover Building ValidationIn this partition, the 3D imaging results of the layover building are shown in Figure 12. Figure 12a shows the building observation geometry. In this situation, Points A, B, and C with the slant range r1 will be superimposed within the same slant range-azimuth resolution cell in the 2D SAR image. The same is true for Points D and E. If the channel imbalance and APC position are calibrated precisely, these layover points will be perfectly reconstructed in the right height position utilizing a super-resolution algorithm. On the contrary, these layover points will not be properly reconstructed, such as the occurrence of disturbance points, location shifts, or even defocusing. When the channel imbalance and APC position have been calibrated by the proposed algorithm, the 3D imaging result is shown in Figure 12b. In this figure, we see that Points A, B, and C are resolved and reconstructed in the corresponding position. This is similar to the other points (i.e., Points D and E) of this layover building. For comparison, the 3D imaging results of the APC calibration only and the channel imbalance calibration only are shown in Figure 12c,d, respectively. Compared with Figure 12c,d, there are fewer disturbance points in Figure 12b, especially in the area near the bottom of the building. This is because the imaging results of these areas are more sensitive to system parameters due to the very small difference in height between the building and the ground. It is therefore safe to say that the imaging results of Figure 12b is better and shows the validity of the unified calibration algorithm proposed in this paper.To qualitatively exhibit the validity of the calibration algorithm we propose in this paper, the 3D focusing result of a residential area after channel imbalance and APC position calibration is shown below. The SAR 3D focusing result can be approached as follows. Applying a classical imaging algorithm to the raw SAR data collected by each channel, we obtain N 2D SLC images. After some sub-pixel accuracy coregistration to the reference channel and a unified calibration for the channel imbalance and APC position, a super-resolution algorithm, such as compressed sensing [3] or the direction of arrivals [12], is applied to each slant range-azimuth resolution cell. Following this, the 3D imaging result is obtained. The Google Earth image, SLC image, and 3D image of the residential area are shown in Figure 13. As shown in the SLC image, in the 2D SAR image, we cannot even correctly estimate the number of buildings owing to the serious layover phenomenon. When 3D imaging was carried out after precise calibration of the array parameters, the building footprints and the texture of the roof and façade were all clearly visible.", 4. Experimental Results, 4.3. Calibration Algorithm Validation,4
44,"Both the simulation and array InSAR system results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed unified calibration algorithm. The simulation results showed that the calibration accuracy of the phase inconsistency and APC position went up to 0.06 rad and 0.105 mm, respectively. The application to the array InSAR system, a single-pass multi-baseline TomoSAR system, demonstrated the effectiveness of the unified calibration algorithm. Both the point-like targets (e.g., GCPs) and distributed target (e.g., flat ground) presented more reliable 3D imaging results after calibration. In the simulation, the calibration accuracy mentioned above provided the super-resolution ability to distinguish two targets with a 4.5 m height interval (e.g., the 4th pair layover GCPs in Table 2) despite the system’s Rayleigh resolution of only 35 m. The resolution results in the height direction of the array InSAR system showed a similar super-resolution performance with a better separation of the building façade and ground (e.g., Figure 12b).As discussed before, our proposed algorithm calibrated not only the channel imbalance but also the APC position. This is of great importance since both the channel imbalance (especially the phase inconsistency) and the APC position are the key parameters of the super-resolution algorithm. This proposed algorithm makes it possible to obtain a super-resolution performance in the height direction where the Rayleigh resolution is usually about 10–50 times below that in range or azimuth. In addition, the signal model uses the Fresnel approximation, which increases the accuracy of the calibration signal model. Although the proposed algorithm is of great accuracy, other tasks lie ahead: First, the question of how to choose GCPs for calibration, including the choice of size and position, needs to be studied, since the quality of GCPs will directly affect calibration results. In addition, the derivation of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) [23,24] and the quantitative assessment method require further study.", 5. Discussion,None,5
45,"The multi-baseline TomoSAR system-like array InSAR system, whose antennas are placed in the cross-track direction, can obtain 3-D reconstruction images of the observation area in a single-pass flight campaign. In particular, when using the super-resolution algorithm in height focusing, we can obtain a high height resolution close to the azimuth and ground range resolutions. However, the high resolution in the height direction is based on the condition that the channel imbalance and APC position are precisely known. This is almost impossible, even though high-precision laboratory measurements have been carried out, since there are many factors that may lead to parameters changing in a flight campaign, such as installation error and the difference between the mechanical position and electromagnetic phase center. When a system error occurs, the 3-D resolution performance will be seriously degraded. In order to ensure the 3-D resolution performance of the TomoSAR system, especially the super-resolution performance in the height direction, the calibration processing of the channel imbalance and APC position is therefore necessary.In our signal model, the Fresnel approximation is used. It is of great significance since the quadratic wave model is more accurate than the plane wave model, and most small aircraft platforms and UAVs work in relatively low flight height conditions. The importance of the proposed algorithm also lies in the fact that both the channel imbalance and APC position are accurately calibrated, which provides the basis for super-resolution in the height direction. This conclusion is supported by experiments based on a simulation data set and real data set acquired by the array InSAR system. ", 6. Conclusions,None,6
46,"Forest biomass monitoring is important for several reasons: the critical role of forests on carbon stock and flux, quantification of the effect of deforestation on greenhouse gas emissions, and its use as an indicator of land cover change in UN-FAO’s national statistics [1,2,3]. Remote sensing has been widely used in past decades to estimate biomass, monitor deforestation, and carbon stock management [4,5,6].Remote sensing for estimating biomass can be divided into two-dimensional and three-dimensional methods. Two-dimensional methods use optical reflectance or SAR backscatter and relate it to biomass using regression [7,8,9]. Satellites such as LANDSAT and MODIS have been used for this purpose [10,11]. The main problem with these methods is that the signal is insensitive to the increase of biomass above a certain level, i.e., the saturation effect. Therefore, they can only be used for areas with low biomass such as savannas [9]. In the case of using SAR data, they can be extended to medium-level biomass if L and P band or multi-temporal SAR data is used [12,13,14,15]. In contrast, biomass estimation using three-dimensional methods is more accurate since forest biomass is strongly related to the vertical structure of the trees [16,17,18,19]. Airborne and space-borne Lidar can provide an accurate height map of the forested areas that later can be converted into a biomass map [16,20,21]. In some studies, ground-based Lidar has been used to obtain biomass map as well [17,22]. Other means of acquiring a height map are photogrammetry, Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and Polarimetric Interferometric SAR (PolInSAR) [23,24]. PolInSAR records the reflected SAR signal from the same objects from two different points in two different times [25]. InSAR and PolInSAR give a height map of a lower accuracy than Lidar, but they cover large areas and can be used under all weather conditions [26,27]. InSAR can produce a tree height map in two ways, e.g., by subtracting a DEM from InSAR height or by using dual-wavelength InSAR i.e., TanDEM-X and E-SAR [19,28,29].More advanced techniques such as TomoSAR and fusion of LiDAR and InSAR have also been used to estimate biomass [30,31,32]. These techniques provide more accurate results as compared to InSAR. The height estimation accuracy of PolInSAR and TomoSAR is directly affected by the presence of temporal decorrelation [33,34,35]. Temporal decorrelation is the change in SAR signal reflected from the objects changes in the position or attributes during the image acquisition time [36]. We may thus expect that the accuracy of biomass estimation improves after mitigating the temporal decorrelation. Recently, the Random-Motion-over-Ground (RMoG) model has been proposed to compensate the effect of temporal decorrelation on height estimation using PolInSAR. This model is based upon the RVoG model combined with modeling motion of trees in the vertical direction. It has shown promising results in improving height estimation accuracy up to 20% [33,37]. We have proposed the Random-Motion-over-Ground-Legendre (RMoG



L


) model based on the RMoG model, but with the Fourier–Legendre series as the structure function instead of the simple exponential function used in the RMoG model [38].The main objective of this paper is to analyze the accuracy of biomass estimation after correcting for temporal decorrelation. To do so, the first step is to develop a model to estimate biomass from PolInSAR height maps resulting from the Random-Volume-over-Ground (RVoG), RMoG, and RMoG



L


 models. We have selected the Remningstorp forest as a study area as it has been studied during BioSAR2010 campaign [39] as the test site. Both linear and non-linear models were developed to clarify the relation between PolInSAR height and biomass. The second step is to apply different strategies for train and test dataset selection to make sure that the chosen model is general and accurate enough [40]. At the final step, for evaluating the results both field data and Lidar data were used.This paper has been organized in the following sections: first, a short introduction of biomass estimation using remote sensing in general and SAR data specifically is given. Second, the dataset and study area is characterized. In the third section, explanation of the methodology is given. In the fourth section, the results are presented followed by the discussion and the conclusion sections.", 1. Introduction,None,1.

48,"Field observations used in this study have been collected resulting in 214 circular plots with a radius of 10 m [39]. The location of these field plots is shown in Figure 2.The area has been divided into several stands based upon the homogeneity of forest cover type. Field plots have been defined in such a way that they fall into one of these stands completely to minimize the effect of heterogeneity within the plots.Measurements inside each plot according to the Heureka forestry system [42] include an H100 height, defined as the basal area weighted average of the 10 highest trees in each plot [18], Diameter at Breast Height (D

According to the recorded information, 60% of the field plots is covered by spruce, 30% covered by pine, and 10% dominated by oak, birch, and aspen (mixed deciduous) trees. Additionally, dry aboveground biomass, including stems, branches, bark, and needles, has been measured [39]. For all 10 m radius field plots, biomass was between 6 and 250 ton ha

Developing these equations requires excessive field work and the data are only valid for a 5-year period. After this period, the density and the factor f change, so the measurements are repeated every five years. In this paper, we used the previously developed allometric equations for the test site [39].Lidar data of the study area were acquired with an average density of 69 returns m

L


 models. Second, the biomass map produced from Lidar data [20,39,41] was used for the assessment of generated biomass maps from PolInSAR heights beside the field data. The predicted biomass map from Lidar height is presented in Figure 3.Besides predicting the biomass map, we used the Lidar Digital Surface Model (DSM) with a cell size of 0.5 × 0.5 m, as the reference height map. Since we have the canopy height map, the Lidar DSM is called the Canopy-Height-Model (CHM) hereafter. This map was derived from the differences between the first and the last returns of the Lidar pulses and is displayed in Figure 4. Both the predicted biomass map and the CHM have been used as the reference data sets.The areas with zero height values on the Lidar CHM are masked on the predicted biomass map. The areas with taller trees on the Lidar CHM correspond to areas with the highest biomass values. The two maps show a clear positive correspondence between tree height and biomass.", 2.

These images were collected with the ONERA SETHI airborne sensor, developed by the Office National d’Etudes et de Recherches Aérospatiales (ONERA) [39]. This device can acquire full Polarimetric Interferometric SAR images in both L and P bands.Three pairs of P-band images, acquired specifically for PolInSAR analysis, were chosen for this study.

50,"Since the Polarimetric Interferometric SAR systems illuminates an area from two different positions at two different times, any change in the objects is represented in the form of signal decorrelation. Thus, the height of the trees, like other properties, can be retrieved by reversing the process of interferograms generation, e.g., quantifying the decorrelation sources. In the past decade, the models used for obtaining tree properties were only taking volumetric decorrelation into account. Volumetric decorrelation is the inconsistency of the signal caused by the vertical structure of the trees. In the presence of natural phenomena in particular wind, changes in the position of the scatterers cause temporal decorrelation. This should be taken into account when estimating tree height. The following models have been applied to estimate height without and with accounting for temporal decorrelation. 2.4.1. The RVoG ModelThe RVoG model has been popular over the past decade for estimating forest height [46,47,48]. It relates the observed complex coherence to the height of the vegetation layer with the assumption that only volumetric decorrelation is present. It expresses the volumetric coherence

To solve Equation (5), we need to estimate

, so we need a polarization channel as the volume and another channel as the ground scattering representation. Solving Equations (2)–(5) is done with a multi-stepwise procedure following [47].As the RVoG model ignores temporal decorrelation, it provides biased results if the temporal decorrelation is high. This can happen due to wind or precipitation. To tackle this limitation, the RMoG model has been proposed [37], which models the induced motion caused by wind in the vertical direction. 2.4.2. The RMoG ModelThe RMoG model assumes that the vegetation layer consists of randomly distributed vertical scattering objects located on a rough dielectric layer. The main difference with the RVoG model here is to assume that both layers have random movements along the vertical axis [33]. The complex coherence using the RMoG model

The procedure of solving Equation (6) is explained in details in [33].Here, the primary assumption is that the maximum of the structure function occurs at the top of the canopy layer and the volume backscatter and from ground components are distinguishable. This assumption leads to biased height estimation especially in complex and multi-layer forests [37]. To improve the accuracy of the RMoG model, and inspired by [48], we have proposed the RMoG

 Model",2
54,"The most important outcome of the RVoG, RMoG, and RMoG



L


 models is a height map of the area. Averaged, plot-wise height values are then extracted from these height maps. In this study, we applied a buffer zone of 10 m to reduce the border effect.We used a robust regression model to retrieve biomass from PolInSAR height. The used algorithm is non-linear least square fitting with LAR (Least Absolute Resiuals) algorithm for providing the prediction bounds within a 95% of confidence interval [50,51]. According to past studies, there are different assumptions about the relation between biomass and PolInSAR height. The first and most common assumption is that the biomass can be obtained from PolInSAR height by a linear equation [9]. In other studies, this relation has been shown to be non-linear [41]. Therefore, to find the best model for estimating biomass, we started by a polynomial model to relate biomass to PolInSAR height. The general form of this model is

 according to [52]. As is evident from Equation (12), the relation between biomass and PolInSAR is non-linear.Another common assumption is that biomass increases proportionally to the increase of height. Therefore, as a further examination, the one-term and two-term exponential equations were tested. Furthermore, we tested whether the power series can describe the relation between two variables.

 are the coefficients to be estimated.The reliability of Equations (12)–(14) is based upon the assumption that the observed height values have a normal distribution of errors. In our case, according to [39,41], outliers occur in measured biomass values. Robust regression [53] was therefore applied to avoid the effect of outliers on estimated parameters. It assigns a weight value to each data point with weights being adjusted iteratively. In the first iteration, one value, in our case 0.5, is assigned to all data points, and by using normal least squares the coefficients are estimated. In the next iterations, the weights are re-estimated to place less emphasis on the points at a larger distance from model predictions. Next, the model coefficients are recalculated using weighted least squares. This procedure proceeds until the difference between each estimated coefficient in two different iterations is below a thereshold, selected as 0.005 in this study [41]. 2.5.1. Data SplittingThe selection of a training and a test data set directly affects the reliability of estimated parameters. Different strategies exist for solving the so-called “data splitting” problem [40,54]. It is important to choose a good subset of data for training that preserves the generality of the model while having high accuracy. These two aspects, however, are conflicting. For determining the best training subset, we applied two procedures. First, we selected 75%, 50%, and 25% of the data points randomly as the training set and carried out the regression. Second, the field plots were divided into three groups based upon measured biomass value as low (<120 ton ha

56,"To compare PolInSAR height with ground truth data, the first step is to convert the height maps from slant-range to ground-range. This was done using a precise DEM available in the campaign data and using the suggested method in [39]. We used both field and Lidar data as the reference height map. For evaluating the accuracy of three different height estimation models, the average height inside each plot was compared with the corresponding values on Lidar CHM and with the H100 value of each plot. Different metrics were used for evaluating the RVoG, RMoG, and RMoG

 models. To test the distribution of measured and obtained biomass maps and for comparing them, the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) test was applied [55]. A one-sample KS test examined the null hypothesis that the data distribution is a hypothesized distribution against the alternative that it does not follow such distribution.

57,"A summary of the most important biophysical parameters measured within field plots is provided in Table 1 and a histogram in Figure 5. These values are reported for the whole dataset, whereas the regression analyses results are based on the selected training data as described in Section 2.5.1.According to Table 1, the measured biomass varies from 1.2 to 315.96 ton ha

Other measured biophysical parameters i.e., basal area and mean diameter also have a wide range of variation.The histogram is skewed and shows several peaks.

. This multi-modal histogram validates our choice to divide the data into different categories and to select a training data set for each category. The relation between measured biomass and biomass predicted by Lidar is presented in Figure 6. The relative error is approximately equal to 12.7%.The plot shows a positive correlation between measured biomass and predicted biomass by Lidar height. Two points marked with circles are most likely measurement errors.After processing SLC PolInSAR images and obtaining complex coherence [25], height maps using the RVoG, RMoG, and RMoG



L


 models were obtained. The height map generated by the RMoG



L


 model is shown in Figure 7.Figure 7 shows a good agreement with the Lidar CHM of Figure 4. For shorter trees, we see that the RMoG



L


 model overestimates tree heights, while for taller trees the height is underestimated. Plot-wise averaged height values from three different models were compared to the corresponding H100 values. The results showed that

 mode. The weak correlation between PolInSAR height and H100 is because H100 is measured based on the tallest trees inside each field plot while the PolInSAR height represents the average of canopy height. Similarly, height maps obtained from the RVoG, RMoG, and RMoG



L


 models were compared with Lidar CHM, and results are shown in Figure 8. The Lidar and PolInSAR heights show a positive correlation. In the case of the RMoG model, the noise has decreased and the data points are closer to the least square line. We also observe that the PolInSAR height estimation error increases with increasing tree heights.Next, we selected training and test sets for performing regression analyses. The stratified sampling leads to more accurate biomass estimation. All results hereafter have been obtained using stratified sampling. The relation between PolInSAR height and biomass was examined using different models. First, we fitted a polynomial model to relate the PolInSAR height and biomass. The results are listed in Table 2.The highest

 and lowest RMSE values were obtained by the RMoG

 model. Another important observation is that, if we set 


H

, then

. The B value shows the error of the fitted polynomial model for estimating biomass from PolInSAR height. We can force a no-intercept regression to estimate biomass, but the RMSE value then becomes high (

). Next, we correlated height obtained by PolInSAR and biomass via an exponential model and a power series. The results of fitting the exponential model are listed in Table 3.Similar to polynomial regression, the RMoG



L


 model is the best model, with the lowest RMSE and highest 


R
2


 value. Previous studies [52] suggest using an exponential model to estimate biomass from height. We observed that the RMSE is higher than when using the polynomial model, and 


R
2


 is lower. In contrast with the third-degree polynomial, the exponential model passes through the origin, hence a zero biomass value for 


H
=
0


. In addition, the power series was tested to estimate biomass, and the results are presented in Table 4.We obtain higher RMSE values by using power series in comparison with the polynomial and exponential models. According to the variation of the data set and to provide further comparison, the piece-wise regression was also tested.

Figure 8a does not show the saturation point clearly, which is in line with other studies [52].According to Table 2, Table 3, Table 4 and Table 5 and Figure 9, the most accurate model is the exponential model, while the piece-wise regression also showed good results. Since it is more straightforward to fit a single curve to the whole dataset, we selected the exponential to produce the biomass map. For accuracy assessment, the remaining 52 plots out of 214 field plots were used as the test data set. Different metrics were employed for this purpose [57,58]. These metrics included bias

. The results are listed in Table 6.Biomass values of the test dataset were compared to corresponding predicted biomass by the Lidar data, and the results are plotted in Figure 10.Furthermore, the relation between PolInSAR height and mean diameter on the one hand and basal area on the other have been examined to gain insight into how these biophysical parameters affect height measurements. The results are shown in Figure 11. The results showed a significantly better performance of the RMoG



L


 model on test data.The results of applying two-dimensional KS-test between predicted biomass by PolInSAR and Lidar data are listed in Table 7, whereas the biomass map resulting from the RMoG



L


 model is shown in Figure 12. The results showed a positive linear relation between mean diameter, basal area, and PolInSAR height, whereas the relation between mean diameter and basal area are stronger. This shows that inclusion of the mean diameter in obtaining biomass estimation models increases the accuracy of the biomass estimation.The parameter h equals 0 if the null hypothesis of having similar CDFs is not rejected and equals 1 if the CDFs are not similar at the 0.05 significance level. The parameter D is the distance between two dataset distribution functions and shows the goodness of fit. From Table 7, we can see the D decreased by 50% by applying the RMoG



L


 model.To provide a better comparison, the predicted biomass by PolInSAR height was also compared to the measured biomass of the field plots. The results are shown in Figure 13.The results shows a positive linear relation between PolInSAR predicted biomass and field biomass for all three height estimation models. Figure 13c shows better performance of the RMoG

58,"In this paper, we investigated whether correcting for temporal decorrelation improves biomass estimation accuracy. From the BioSAR2010 campaign, we selected plots with a 10 m radius, in line with other studies [41]. Recorded values for these plots showed that biomass and other structural parameters had a broad range of varieties. This feature enabled us to examine how the PolInSAR height is related to different levels of biomass. Moreover, the effect of saturation was observed.For evaluating three different height estimation models, the H100 and Lidar CHM were used as reference data. Neither Lidar nor PolInSAR height showed a significant correlation with the H100 parameter. The reason is that H100 represents the tallest trees, while the PolInSAR and Lidar height in each pixel represents the average of tree heights. In contrast, the Lidar and PolInSAR height values showed a strong relation. As we expected and as was shown previously, the relative error of height estimation decreased from 35% for the RVoG model to 18.6% for the RMoG



L


 models.Since there is no agreement in previous studies whether the correlation between biomass and tree height is linear or not, we examined different regression models. The outcome of the training sets should be a model that can predict the values for the test data set accurately and meanwhile is able to predict new data. If the model is over-trained, the accuracy will be good but the model would not be able to produce good results with new data. These two aspects, accuracy and generality, is known as the bias and variance dilemma [54]. It becomes important when dealing with a high volume of data and when the developed model is being used in estimating biomass at the global scale. In this study, we tried two different strategies for data splitting to evaluate the effect of training set data selection on estimating biomass. The results showed a better performance of stratified sampling, but the computational time increased threefold. The best result is achieved by fitting an exponential model. The exponential curve and the piece-wise regression show a saturation effect for a biomass level above 300 ton ha

.The RMSE of biomass estimation decreased from 46% when using height resulting from the RVoG model to 30% for the RMoG

 model. As expected, there is a considerable improvement in estimating biomass after modeling temporal decorrelation. The results validated the hypothesis of the improvement of biomass estimation after correcting for temporal decorrelation.Our results were compatible with previous studies for the same test site. For example, InSAR images at C-band were employed to estimate stem volume and achieved an RMSE value of 27% [60]. Similar studies using L and P-bands estimated biomass with RMSE values between 30–40% for L-band and between 20–30% for P-band [57,61]. Interestingly, recent research in Remningstorp area using TanDEM-X interferometric heights showed an RMSE value around 16.5% [41]. This improvement can be due to a larger number of baselines and a high number of field plots. Other studies in tropical [62], temperate [63,64], boreal, and hemi-boreal forests [65] showed an average error between 2 and 5 m with and average of 3.5 m in estimating tree heights using PolInSAR. This shows a PolInSAR height can be used to estimate biomass in different forest types.The RMSE only, however, cannot be enough to show the model performance. Based on Table 6, the RVoG model has a significant bias, which, after correcting for temporal decorrelation, has decreased by about 50%. Moreover, the correlation increased from 0.45 for the RVoG model to 0.82 for the RMoG

 in estimating biomass can have a huge effect on improving accuracy.The result of the one-dimensional KS test showed a different distribution of measured biomass and predicted biomass by all height estimation models and Lidar data. The two-dimensional KS test showed similar distribution functions for predicted values by Lidar and PolInSAR data. The main reason is that, at the plot level, biomass is measured for individual trees, while remotely sensed data measure the canopy of trees that are spread around the tree trunk.There is a requirement for methods that can estimate biomass at broader scales. The method and dataset we used here are limited because we used one pair of PolInSAR images. By using multi-baseline tomographic PolInSAR images, we can add more terms to the structure function of the RMoG



L


 model. Therefore, reconstruction of the tree structure has a higher resolution. We expect that this leads to more accurate biomass maps, but with an increased computation time.There are other biophysical parameters of trees i.e., diameter and basal area that affect the SAR signal. The ideal case would be to develop a model based on height, diameter, and the basal area of the trees. In the case of using PolInSAR data, the only observable parameter is tree height. One possibility is to use the field data together with PolInSAR height, but in doing so the developed model would only be applicable to this area and we lose any generality. Thus, we chose to develop a model based on only PolInSAR height to maintain the general applicability of the model [41,52].Our findings showed a strong relation between PolInSAR height and above-ground biomass. The accuracy of biomass estimation improved considerably after correcting for temporal decorrelation. This means that the accuracy of height estimation is directly related to the biomass estimation accuracy. This shows the importance of mitigating temporal decorrelation in estimating height using PolInSAR since such mitigationaffects the further products of height maps such as biomass. At present, the P-band images, on which we tested our proposed model, are only available in airborne sensors. Although they will also be available on spaceborne sensors in the near future, it would be of great value to examine the effect of the correction of temporal decorrelation on biomass estimation accuracy using other wavelengths, especially the L-band. As a sequel to this study, we suggest developing a unique structure function for each tree type according to the availability of the forest classification map. This will lead to more accurate biomass maps [66].", 4. Discussion,None,4
59,"This study showed that, after mitigation of temporal decorrelation , the accuracy of biomass estimation improved by approximately 10%. Therefore, for producing biomass maps of a desirable accuracy, the temporal decorrelation factor should be considered. The best model selected for estimating biomass from PolInSAR was the exponential curve. Furthermore, we showed, in forests with diverse levels of biomass, that it is a good approach to divide the area according to the different height classes and use different regression lines for each class. By using PolInSAR height, the saturation level increases from 150 to 300 ton ha

. This is important in tropical forests where biomass is high and saturation becomes an issue.A weak relation was observed between remotely sensed height maps and H100 values. This is due to the sensitivity of remote sensing sensors to the average height of the tree canopy versus the H100, which represents the tallest trees inside each plot. Basal area and mean diameter also affect the SAR signals, and consequently PolInSAR height estimatesThe presented results demonstrate the capability of PolInSAR to obtain biomass maps. This is important since, in the near future, the satellite BIOMASS mission aims to produce biomass maps with wall-to-wall coverage of important forested areas.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
60,"Forests include the most important carbon pool within the terrestrial ecosystems [1,2], playing a substantial role in the climate change mitigation process [3]. They also need to adapt to these changes to be able to provide efficient ecosystem services for human wellbeing [4].Biodiversity loss, land degradation, pollution, resource depletion, and climate change have intensified in recent decades and have reached an unprecedented level in human history [5]. Despite all the agreements and targets assumed at the European and global levels, the sustainable use of resources and the ecological reconstruction of degraded areas have not reached the extent necessary to achieve these targets. On the contrary, the natural capital loss has reached an irreversible threshold, with enormous costs to society [6]. Urgent measures are being taken in this regard. Recently, the focus on forests and biological diversity associated with these ecosystems has moved up on the agenda of European policy makers due to the release of documents such as the European Green Deal, the 2030 Climate Target Plan, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, and the targets on carbon neutrality by 2050. The big question arising from these documents is: should we set aside forests or sustainable forest management? The EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 provides that a minimum of 10% of the EU territory must be strictly protected [7], while the bioeconomy relies on sustainable biomass [8], forestry being one of the main sources. The big challenge in the next decades will be to balance biodiversity conservation, aiming to maintain or to improve the conservation status of species and habitats, with the sustainable forest management that produces, on the one hand, the renewable materials much needed in the bioeconomy sector, and on the other, plenty of ecosystem services for human wellbeing. Part of these services will be lost by non-intervention (e.g., provisioning services through timber and non-timber products) and others will be gained (e.g., regulating services through sediment retention, water regulation, and cultural services through recreation). The necessary attention must be paid to the possible shift of pressure on forest resources from Europe to other parts of the planet.Through an efficient way of storing carbon, sustainable forest management is considered one of the most cost-effective climate change mitigation solutions in forestry [3]. In the coming years, the targets on emission reduction will increase, leading to the necessity of a functional and stable carbon market that should become the main source of financing for the forest owners that voluntarily apply specific management that allows carbon storage and sequestration. Meanwhile, the valuation of carbon storage and sequestration methodologies must be refined and ready to be used in practice.The various strategies that can be used in the fight against climate change, such as carbon sink, energy efficiency, renewable energy, reducing emissions from burning fossil fuels, etc., must be monetarily assessed to prioritize the implementation based on cost-effectiveness. Sustainable forest management is a cost-effective climate change mitigation solution with a series of other environmental, social, and economic co-benefits [3].Plenty of studies have focused on estimating carbon stock, using satellite products [9,10], national forest inventory [11,12,13], specific field data collection [14] or mixed data sources [15]. Studies on the monetary valuation of forest carbon storage and sequestration have been conducted to date [16,17,18], but not to the same extent as the first ones; there is still a lot to do in this field.The monetary valuation of forest ecosystem services is important because it attaches a price on nature [19]; therefore, the results of the valuation are more tangible and easier to interpret compared with less tangible ecosystem services (e.g., aesthetic, spiritual, biological regulation). This facilitates the process of raising awareness on the need to sustainably manage forest ecosystems. The valuation can also act as a guiding tool for public policy makers or private decision-makers involved in the climate change field [20]. The policy reforms related to the increasing of the EU’s climate ambition for 2030 and 2050 will help to ensure effective carbon pricing throughout the economy [21].In terms of sequestered carbon estimation, previous studies reported in the literature [22,23,24,25] have focused on different approaches, most of them unstandardized, without independent cross-validation in the field. The InVEST software platform offers a standardized procedure by using open models to evaluate ecosystem services and tradeoffs in a geospatial environment [26]. This approach makes it easier to integrate objective cross-validation such as terrestrial LiDAR scanning technology.Our overarching goal was to quantify and validate the valuation process through which the amount of both carbon stock and carbon sequestered is calculated and monetized by combining multiple techniques based on GIS and the terrestrial scanning and monetary valuation method showing the market value of the sequestered carbon in a specific time frame and area of interest. Our specific goals were to adapt an InVEST model to forested areas where management plans are available, to validate the method of estimating carbon stored using Terrestrial Laser Scanner technology in field inventory plots, and to propose a monetary valuation of carbon storage and sequestration for ecosystem services.", 1.

61,"Our study area was in the Retezat National Park, the first national park established in Romania and one of the richest in biodiversity. It is located in the southwestern part of Romania, in the western part of the Southern Carpathians, comprising most of the Retezat-Godeanu Massif, but also a portion of the Tarcu Mountains (Figure 1). The area is designated also as the MAB UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, a site of community importance (ROSCI0217 Retezat) and a special protection area (ROSPA0084 Retezat Mountains). Retezat is famous for its floristic diversity, housing 1179 species of higher plants. The existence there of more than a third of Romania’s flora is one of the reasons why this territory was declared a national park. Due to its very diverse habitats, natural or slightly modified by human intervention, Retezat is home to a particularly rich fauna, both in terms of the number of species and in terms of the large number of specimens that make up the populations of these species [27].", 2.

62,"The INVEST model requires a raster with the actual Land Use/Land Cover for each pixel where each unique number represents a different LULC category. Rasters values correspond to the carbon pools table containing land-use code, the carbon stock in the aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, dead organic matter, and soil (see Appendix A). The raster, with a resolution of 30 × 30 m2, was created by merging two matrices: a raster obtained based on the vectors available in the forest management plans and one raster for the rest of the other land uses, up to the national park boundaries, based on PANGAEA product [28].For the valuation of carbon storage and sequestration ecosystem services, we used the InVEST application, which considers the values of the 4 carbon pools: aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, soil, and dead organic matter [26]. Based on the Land Use/Land Cover maps and the carbon amount in each of the carbon pools, we estimated the amount of carbon stored in a unit area in a 10-year timeframe.The carbon pools values were determined based on the standing volume from the forest management plans using the provisions of the Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories [29], for carbon density in aboveground biomass [30], belowground biomass, and in dead organic matter, and then the carbon density in soil [31].To validate the estimated carbon based on the InVEST model, we placed 4 test plots in 4 different forest stands in which we used a mobile scanner for a precise determination of the position of each tree, the number of trees, diameter, volume and to derive the carbon stored at tree level. The design of the plot was circular with an area equal to the 30-m pixel size used in the InVEST model.For mobile scanning, we used GeoSlam Zeb Revo, a portable scanner with a 3D mapping technology, a versatile technology adapted to any environment. The scanning process is based on the GeoSLAM algorithm, simultaneous location, and mapping which facilitates fast, dynamic mapping of the environment without the need for GPS, with a relative accuracy of 1–3 cm. The result was a pointcloud summing 1.5 million points in each plot.To extract the tree parameters, the point cloud was processed using multiple steps such as off-ground point cloud extraction using cloth simulation filter, tree individualization (segmentation), determination of the characteristics of the tree stand, and each tree using 3D Forest [32].To derive the total carbon stored by each tree from the validation plot, the following formula was used, and it was derived from unified equations based on the diameter at breast height (DBH) on spruce from previous studies [29,31,33]. This formula was used because spruce was majoritarian in all the validation plots.

Using a carbon market price, we estimated the economic value of the sequestered carbon (the avoided social damage of not releasing that ton of carbon into the atmosphere). For monetary evaluation, we used economic data such as price/ton of carbon, market discount rate, and the annual rate of change in the price of carbon (described in Appendix A). We also introduced the analysis of the global carbon price on the voluntary market, which was 3 US $/CO2 e in 2018 [34]. The carbon market has increased in recent years, but not at the level needed for achieving the Paris Agreement temperature goal. The World Bank estimates that an average price of 60 US $/tCO2 e is needed in 2020 to be in line with the achievement of the above-mentioned temperature goal [35].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2.

63,"The geo-spatial data from the forest management plan enhanced the results extracted with the Carbon model from InVEST. Thus, after running the Carbon model to InVEST, the results were described not only as a summary of all the data calculated by the model (Table 1) but under the format of a geospatial matrix, a raster containing the amount of carbon distributed on a 900 sq.m rectangular pixel (Figure 2).The carbon storage rasters show the amount of carbon stored in each pixel for the current (2019) (Figure 2a) and future scenario (2029) (Figure 2b). These consist of the sum of all the carbon pools(see Appendix A Figure A1, Figure A2, Figure A3 and Figure A4) required by the model, with a breakdown of carbon in each pool on average of 30% aboveground, 9% belowground, 53% soil and 8% dead organic matter [29].It can be observed that the pastures and most of the non-forest areas in the national park did not perform as carbon storage, most of them were classified in the lowest category with only 0–2 Mg/pixel. The most important storage amount can be observed in the old forest stands, from an orange to red color. The modeled values maintained the normal trend, and the younger the stands, the smaller the stored amount of carbon (Figure 2).In terms of sequestered carbon, in Figure 3 it can be observed that the current landscape of Retezat National Park influenced the spatial distribution of the current and future carbon sequestration. The sequestration raster shows the difference in stored carbon between the future and current land cover. In the sequestration raster, some values are negative and others positive. Positive values indicate sequestered carbon and negative values indicate carbon that has been lost. We observed that the highest rate of carbon sequestration was registered in the young stands, and positive rates in stands less than 100 years old. The stand age was classified based on the information within the forest management plan. It can be observed that most of the old forest stands, with ages over 120 years losing carbon in a 10-year timeframe.", 3. Results, 3.1. Carbon Stock and Sequestration in Retezat Mountains Park,3
64,"In the 4 plots, there were sampled 170 trees, and the point cloud’s models contained on average 12,200 points per tree. The carbon stock varies from 6.74 Mg of C (Plot 3), which is the plot with the highest number of trees, to 27.88 Mg of C (Plot 2) and 27.41 Mg of C (Plot 4), which have a significantly lower number of trees but with higher values at mean DBH, 0.58 and 0.55 m, compared to Plot 3. Plot 1 remains at 22.75 Mg of C, with a lower DBH of 0.52 m compared with Plot 2 and Plot 4 (Table 2).The plot with the highest deviation is Plot 2, with diameter variation from 0.18 to 0.93 m.When intersected with the InVEST models, the data calibrated with forest management inventory aggregated at the subcompartmental level and the plots hierarchy remained the same. Since the modeled values in the field plots provide only the total sequestered carbon, the comparison was performed on the sum of all the pools.The plot with the lowest carbon sequestration remained Plot 3, with 6.95 Mg C, overestimating by 3%. The second in line, Plot 1, over-estimated the value of carbon by about 1% to a value of 22.82 Mg C rather than the 22.75 Mg C from the field estimated with TLS. Plot 2 was over-estimated by the InVEST adapted model by 3% from 27.88 Mg C field data. Plot 4 revealed the highest difference between modeled and field data with a value of 29.12 Mg C, and the InVEST model overestimated the field data, 27.41 Mg C, by approximately 6%. Figure 4 shows the tree position, pointcloud sample, and Mg C calculated at tree level for each of the plots in the analysis.", 3. Results, 3.2.

65,"Using the economic data, the simulation generated a raster with the economic value (currency per pixel) of the sequestered carbon in the actual and future scenarios (Figure 5). The total economic value of the carbon sequestration service within Retezat National Park was estimated at 1,706,070.28 US$ per 10 years (2019–2029). This value was calculated based on the 2018 global price of the voluntary carbon market. We also ran the model using the carbon price needed in 2020 for achieving the temperature goal established in the Paris Agreement (60 US $/tCO2 e). The results are twenty times higher than those that resulted from using the price of the voluntary market, showing an immense gap between the actual market and the needed one.Moreover, the model provides intermediate results in the form of a raster on each carbon pool separately (aboveground, underground, in dead organic matter and the soil up to 90 cm), both for the current year (2019) and for the future scenario (2029) (see Appendix A).According to the spatial distribution of the economic value of sequestered Carbon, there can be clusters of areas with high values grouped around the young stand with a high capacity of sequestering Carbon.", 3.

66,"Combining cross-technologies to quantify, spatialize, and monetize carbon storage and sequestration proves to be an important tool for stakeholders such as managers, decision-makers, and landowners. This clear representation and use of data and knowledge translate the information to break the boundaries which, in many cases, are blocking the understanding of how important this part of the ecosystem service inside a protected area is.According to the Romanian Forest Code: “Legal entities and public institutions that benefit, from an economic, ecological or social point of view, from the effects of the protection function of neighboring forests, other than those owned, pay the value of these functions according to the provisions regulated by special law”. To date, due to the complexity of the benefits, a clear mechanism of evaluation and monetization has not been developed; moreover, the forest code stipulates that the budget of forest management units is constituted, among others, by the value of the effects of forest protection functions. In this light, our paper demonstrates the validity and applicability of a valuation process through which the amount of both stored and sequestered carbon is calculated and monetized, by combining multiple techniques based on GIS and terrestrial scanning. The proposed valuation method can be considered by policy makers in their efforts to adopt, by ministerial order, the methodology for the valuation and payment mechanism for forest ecosystem services, which is required by the Forest Code. This type of analysis requires average knowledge of GIS, especially in producing the data input. The InVEST visual interface makes the action of running the model user-friendly in different computational environments.The InVEST model is a powerful tool in Carbon sequestration studies as it can be calibrated using data from other studies, such as forest management plans. Currently, the EU is preparing the Common Agriculture Policy Strategic Plan for 2021–2029, where payments for climate commitments are envisaged. Through our study, we demonstrated with field data that this adapted model can be successfully and rapidly applied to assess the carbon stored and sequestered by an ecosystem and to monetize the value of this service, for future per hectare payments.The field data reveal that using forest management plan data provided a reliable calibration of the InVEST model. The differences between model estimation and ground data were from 1% to 6%. Thus, the data in these management plans are accurate and can be utilized in the economic valuation of the sequestered carbon. This will save an important amount of work, time, and of course money for fieldwork aiming to collect forest carbon-related data. However, for the replication of the valuation methodology presented in this paper, especially at the local level, we recommend conducting a terrestrial scanning validation or traditional forest inventory plots.The payments for ecosystem services related to carbon and sustainable financing mechanisms such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) [36] or woodland Carbon Code [37] need to be considered seriously and supported by the policy makers and the beneficiaries of these services [38]. The payments need to support the management of the ecosystems to provide the services at a level that will enable the climate targets adopted lately at the EU level to be reached.The successfully proven implementation emphasizes that the model can now be adapted to all forest types in Romania either using national parameters or a locally developed one, and further research needs to be carried out for reliable usage to the entire protected area network nationwide.The applied model is setting baselines as it assumes that the timber is not extracted within the national park for the analyzed period of 10 years. However, the model can be adjusted in the context in which in the national park, depending on its zoning, exploitation works can be performed. Moreover, it can be applied in any managed forest, with the monetary values of carbon sequestration decreasing, and be partially compensated by the financial gain obtained from the capitalization of the resulting wood mass.Our combined approach of GIS, mobile terrestrial scanning, and modelling provides a fast, reliable, and standardized tool for estimating and economically evaluating carbon sequestration. We validated a method that can be transformed by decision-makers into a powerful geo-spatial tool to respond in case of major shifts such as windthrows, forest fires, etc. Moreover, spatialization of information can give a fresh and larger perspective on a national strategy on how to implement carbon payment schemes and where to start in terms of prioritization.", 4. Discussion,None,4
67,"The information obtained after applying the economic valuation of carbon storage and sequestration services can support the design of voluntary financial mechanisms for the forest landowners who are willing to adopt conservation-oriented management. In Romania, the forest management plan is a valuable source of reliable and standardized information for carbon valuation.The implementation of forest carbon valuation results may encounter a series of obstacles that must be exceeded. The lack of continuity in the agenda of the political class may lead to giving up the initiatives in this field. Moreover, the assent of local communities and equitable benefit sharing issues are important barriers that need to be addressed before starting the implementation of carbon payment schemes. Deficiencies of carbon markets, uncertain climate effectiveness, and governance issues [39] are additional issues that might be considered.Achieving the average carbon price needed for forest carbon projects is beneficial mainly to help meet emissions reduction goals. This common ground is needed to create the legal framework and infrastructure required by a functional carbon market, to improve stakeholders’ acceptance, to increase data accuracy [35] and transparency, and to include this topic as a priority in the national political agenda.An important challenge arises at the European level on harmonizing the biodiversity targets with climate targets, with a direct impact on landowners and managers. This challenge can be overcome by involving in the process the forest management experience, forest research heritage and academia.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
68,"Mangrove forests, situated in the intertidal zone of tropical and sub-tropical coastal regions, are one of the most productive ecosystems on Earth. Their distinct marine and terrestrial characteristics [1,2,3] provide significant ecological services and functions in terms of coastal water purification, biodiversity conservation, shoreline stabilization, storm protection and fishery harvest [4,5,6]. Moreover, as an important component of blue carbon [7], mangrove forests can sequester carbon in aboveground biomass [8], below-ground biomass [9,10], and in sediments [11,12], which is vital for the equilibrium of the global carbon cycle. Despite an abundant range of economic and ecological values, a third of mangrove forests worldwide have been lost in the last fifty years because of rapid urban growth, increasing population pressure, aquaculture expansion, and other impacts caused by anthropogenic disturbances and climate change [13,14,15,16]. However, there is an emerging demand for conservation and restoration efforts. To make appropriate decisions and polices, the spatio-temporal extent of mangrove forests needs to be inventoried and monitored, and the driving factors of change need to be identified [17,18].Mangrove forests are difficult to monitor because of their inaccessibility and large area, which makes field observation problematic. A considerable number of remote sensing monitoring and mapping studies have been conducted, from the local to the global scale, over the past two decades [19,20]. Various remote sensing-based methodologies, either exclusively or in combination, have been applied to monitor the extent of change in mangrove forests. Traditional mapping approaches, including visual interpretation and on-screen digitization, have been used to map mangrove forests. Applying visual interpretation as an auxiliary support improves the accuracy of classification results obtained by supervised and unsupervised classification methodologies [21]. A variety of classification methods have been investigated and compared to enhance the effectiveness of spectral discrimination for mangrove forests, such as the support vector machine [22], artificial neural networks [23], maximum likelihood classifier [24,25], machine learning [26], and the iterative self-organizing data analysis technique (ISODATA) algorithm [27]. Nevertheless, due to “salt-and-pepper” effects, pixel-based classification methods frequently generate erroneous classifications of pixels [28]. In contrast, the object-oriented classification method segments an image into groups of contiguous and homogeneous pixels (image objects) as the mapping unit [29], which can reduce the “within-class” spectral variation and effectively overcome the salt-and-pepper effect. In addition, these classification methods consider not only the spectral properties of the objects, but also their texture, shape, and geometric features in the classification process, and as a result, more accurate and effective performances are obtained than with pixel-based approaches [30,31,32].Image segmentation is deemed to be a critical prerequisite for object-oriented classification, because its quality largely affects the final performance of geo-object recognition. Understanding how to effectively determine the optimal segmentation scale is crucial to the improvement of segmentation quality [33]. To date, visual inspection has mainly been used to assess the accuracy of segmentation results. For example, Liu et al. (2017) determined the advisable segmentation scale of Google Earth images based on multiple tests and visual analysis [31]. Yet, visual inspection, as a qualitative approach, cannot provide a quantitative evaluation and may suffer from subjectivity, since different people are likely to have different opinions on which segmentation result is better [33,34]. Quantitative evaluation approaches can score a range of segmentation results. However, there are few studies focused on optimal segmentation scale selection in terms of monitoring and mapping for mangrove forests.Given the importance of mangrove forests, as well as the limitations of segmentation scale evaluation and selection methods in mangrove forest mapping, the objectives of this study were to: (1) Apply a systematic optimal segmentation scale selection method to assist in object-oriented image classification; (2) monitor the dynamics of mangrove forest extent during the period 1990–2017, and transitions between mangrove forests and other land cover types; (3) analyze the influence of anthropogenic activities, climate change, and plant invasion on the spatio-temporal changes of mangrove forests; and (4) propose more feasible conservation policies and local management plans for mangrove forests. We used the mangrove forests in Quanzhou Bay, Fujian Province, China, as the study site. An optimal segmentation scale model based on object-oriented classification was applied to determine the best segmentation scale. We combined image segmentation with a decision tree and visual interpretation to produce land cover maps. The mangrove forest dynamics and conversion to and from other land cover types were described using annual land change rate (ALCR), centroid migration, and overlay analysis.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
69,"Quanzhou Bay Estuary Wetland Nature Reserve (QBEWNR) is located in the southeast of Fujian Province, China. The latitude ranges from E118.63° to E118.71° and the longitude ranges from N24.79° to N24.99° (Figure 1). There are two rivers (i.e., Luoyang River and Jinjiang River) in the area, and the Bay has a regular semi-diurnal tide. The nature reserve runs across five districts and cities (Huian, Luojiang, Fengze, Jinjiang, Shishi) from north to west, with a total area of 7,130 ha. The annual mean temperature is 20.4 °C and the average annual precipitation is 1095.4 mm. The prevalent climate of this region is an oceanic monsoon climate, characterized by a warm and wet winter and a hot and rainy summer. The leaf-on season is from April to November, and the leaf-off season is from December to March.In the nature reserve, the mangrove swamp ecosystem is the fundamental object for protection. The main mangrove forest species include Kandelia candel, Aegiceras corniculatum, Avicennia marina, and Acanthus ilicifolius. In addition, there are two species of Spartina—Spartina anglica and Spartina alterniflora. The mangrove swamps provide habitat for endangered and rare species of aquatic animals and waterfowl (Sousa chinensis, Acipenser sinensis, Larus saundersi, and Egretta eulophotes). They also support extensive fisheries and serve as a natural reservoir that provides vital flood control.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area,2
70,"Considering the data consistency, spectral discrimination ability and specific distribution characteristics of mangrove forests in the study area, Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) images (30 m spatial resolution) were selected as the basic data sources with which to analyze the temporal and spatial dynamics of mangrove forests for 1990, 1997, 2005, 2010 and 2017. In addition to mangrove forests, Spartina and mudflats are found within the study area. Previous studies have reported that Spartina expansion has a significant impact on mangrove forest distribution and expansion [31,35]. Consequently, mapping the distribution of Spartina enhances our understanding of the factors influencing mangrove forest change.In the leaf-on season, there are few differences in spectral characteristics between mangrove forests and Spartina. In the leaf-off season, the spectral characteristics of Spartina are similar to those of mudflats. Therefore, it is difficult to distinguish land cover accurately using images from one season. Differentiating mangrove forests, Spartina and mudflats can be improved by using their spectral characteristics in different seasons (Figure 2).To account for the influence of tidal phenomena on the results of coastal land cover identification, two seasonal (leaf-on season and leaf-off season) images were selected in each base year, and these were all acquired during low tide. Detailed tidal information for the images is shown in Table 1. All images were geo-rectified with the registration error being less than half a pixel, and they were all atmospherically corrected using Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) [36].From 2015 to 2017, 171 sampling points were obtained via four field surveys (Figure 1), which were used to evaluate the accuracy of the land cover classification results in 2017. Owing to the lack of field survey data in 1990, 1997, 2005 and 2010, 150 independent points for each year were created by a random sampling scheme. These random points were classified into different land cover types (described in Section 2.3) by consulting with experienced interpreters and local experts, and were then used as validation points. The overall accuracy, user accuracy, producer accuracy, and Kappa coefficient were used to assess the accuracy of each land cover map [37].Data for annual mean temperature and precipitation from 1990 to 2017 were collected at 30 meteorological stations in and around the study area. This allowed the comprehensive and objective analysis of climate change factors driving mangrove forest change. A spatial interpolation method was applied to these meteorological data to obtain a spatially continuous surface.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Data Preparation and Fieldwork,2
71,"A landscape classification system was created, including ten landscape types (Mangrove, Spartina, Mudflat, Water body, Aquaculture pond, Built-up area, Woodland, Cropland, Grassland and Barren land). The details of the classification system and image features for these ten land cover types are given in Table 2.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Land Cover Classification System,2
72,"To improve the boundary consistency between the segmented image objects and real land cover types, an optimal segmentation scale was applied to process the scale segmentation and selection. It is assumed that when the internal homogeneity (i.e., no mixed objects) and neighboring heterogeneity (i.e., high differentiation among adjacent objects) of segmented objects reaches their optimum, the segmentation scale is optimal. The basic concept of the optimal segmentation scale model was referenced by Chabrier et al. [38] and Espindola et al. [39]. Using the model, the relationship between the internal homogeneity and the heterogeneity of segmented objects is expressed by the segmentation quality function, which can objectively evaluate the quality of segmentation effects. In order to obtain the optimal segmentation scale, a series of pre-segmentation experiments for different segmentation scale was performed. In the study, a segmented image series was obtained using 15 different scales, which started with a scale parameter of 10 and ended at 80, increasing by increments of 5.Apart from the segmentation scale, the image segmentation parameters also included shape and compactness factor, which were determined by referencing previous studies and from practical experience [31]. After segmentation, the image objects were classified into specific land cover types using a decision tree and visual interpretation.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4.

In the study, the time interval was divided into 4 stages: 1990–1997, 1997–2005, 2005–2010 and 2010–2017.The invasive species of Spartina (Spartina anglica and Spartina alterniflora) pose a significant threat to the existence and expansion of mangrove forests [41]. From the perspective of species competition, the adverse effects of Spartina on mangrove forests can be reflected by analyzing the spatial and temporal reproduction intensity of Spartina. An exponential growth model was applied to describe the expansion of Spartina, which is calculated as follows [31]:

Analysis of the centroid change of mangrove forests and other land cover types not only allows for the quantitative investigation of the spatial and temporal evolution (direction and distance) of mangrove forests, but also the relationship between mangrove forests and other land cover types. For this purpose, the centroid migrations of mangrove forests and Spartina were analyzed. The equation of centroid is expressed as follows [45]:

75,"We determined the optimal segmentation scale using the optimal segmentation scale model. The segmentation effect and the segmentation quality of different segmentation scales are shown in Figure 3. According to Figure 3, when the segmentation scale was less than 30, the image was over-segmented and one real geo-object was fragmented by more than one resulting segment. When the segmentation scale was greater than 60, the image was under-segmented and one resulting segment covered an area that did not belong to the target geo-object. Moreover, as the segmentation scale increased, additional time was required to segment. Using qualitative visual analysis, we found that the best segmentation effect occurred when the segmentation scale equaled 40, and the corresponding segmentation quality was 0.95. The optimal segmentation scale model calculated the optimal segmentation scale to be 38 and the corresponding segmentation quality was 0.99. The segmentation quality of the optimal segmentation scale obtained by optimal segmentation scale model was better than that of visual judgment.", 3. Results, 3.1. Optimal Segmentation Scale,3
76,"Combining the object-oriented classification, decision tree and visual interpretation, we produced land cover maps of the study area (Figure 4). Table 3 presents the accuracy assessment results of the land cover types in each study year. The overall accuracies of all the classification results were more than 0.91 and all the Kappa coefficients were more than 0.90, which means that our classification results were consistent with those obtained from the validation points.Table 4 shows the change area and ALCR of each land cover type. The comparison in extent of mangrove, Spartina and aquaculture pond are illustrated in Figure 5. The results indicate that the mangrove forests experienced a general increasing trend from 0.09 km2 in 1990 to 2.57 km2 in 2017, with a change rate of 0.09 km2/y and an ALCR of 102.06%. The mangrove forest area decreased only in the period 1997‒2005, while from 2010 to 2017, the mangrove forest area increased rapidly. Spartina exhibited a dramatic increase from 1990 to 2017, implying an average rate of gain of 0.29 km2/y. During 1997‒2005, Spartina expanded markedly, in contrast to the mangrove forest change trend during this period. The distribution range of Spartina expanded from sporadic patches on the West Luoyang River in 1990 to large-scale continuous stands along both sides of the Luoyang River in 2017. During the period 1990‒2017, aquaculture ponds more than tripled in area (from 1.54 to 5.14 km2). Built-up areas increased by 1.76 km2 from 1990 to 2017. Although there were small changes in area, the ALCR of grassland and barren land were 24.07% and 11.11%, respectively, which were relatively higher than other land cover types from 1990 to 2017. In contrast, mudflats decreased sharply with a loss of 15.75 km2 during 1990‒2017.The Sankey diagram visualizes the dynamics of total land cover types from 1990 to 2017 (Figure 6a). The results show that mudflats were the principal land cover type invaded by Spartina. The area of Spartina expansion in mudflats was 65.98, 334.08, 305.45 and 412.37 ha during 1990–1997, 1997–2005, 2005–2010, and 2010–2017, respectively, which suggests an increase over time. However, the annual expansion rate for Spartina was 20.66%, 18.61%, 8.40% and 3.64% during 1990–1997, 1997–2005, 2005–2010, and 2010–2017, respectively, suggesting a progressive decline.", 3. Results, 3.2. Temporal and Spatial Changes of Mangrove Forests,3
77,"Figure 6b and Table 5 illustrate the spatial distribution and area of conversion between mangrove forests and other land cover types. It was found that the conversion region gradually expanded, and the most marked mangrove forest recession occurred from 1997 to 2005, attributed to a large area conversion to mudflats and Spartina, which accounted for 33.51% and 29.74% of mangrove forest reduction in this stage, respectively. During the period 2010‒2017, nearly 181 ha of other land cover types were transformed into mangrove forests and resulted in a significant expansion of mangrove forests in this stage. The proportion of mudflats and Spartina converted into mangrove forests were the highest of the different land cover types, accounting for 72.97% and 25.48%, respectively. There was little conversion among mangrove forests and cropland, built-up areas or aquaculture ponds during the study period. These results suggest that the change in mangrove forest area can be attributed to their expansion in mudflats and the ecological competition with Spartina.The centroid migration routes of mangrove forests and Spartina are displayed in Figure 7. From 1990 to 2017, the centroid of mangrove forests experienced a trend of shifting landward before 1997 and a process of shifting seaward after 1997. The centroid of Spartina showed a persistent seaward migration throughout the study period. It is noteworthy that the distance between the mangrove forest centroid and the centroid of Spartina was increasing, changing from 159.57 m in 1990 to 7308.92 m in 2017.", 3. Results, 3.3. Conversions between Mangrove Forests and Other Land Cover Types,3
78,"Spartina, as invasive plant species, were first introduced to China’s coastal provinces from the Atlantic Coast of the U.S. for coastal environment promotion in 1976 [46]. However, due to their rapid growth, high productivity and strong adaptability, introduced Spartina expanded rapidly in tidal zones and now pose a tremendous threat to native biodiversity. Once Spartina have invaded the mangrove forest gaps, they inhibit the germination and growth of mangrove seedlings by competing for space, light and nutrients [47,48]. Our results found that the propagation of mangrove forests was suppressed where they grew in or around Spartina (Figure 4). Conversion to Spartina was the primary contributor of mangrove forest losses, especially from 1997 to 2005 (Table 5). Previous studies have also shown Spartina expansion increased the pressure on survival and breeding of mangrove forests [48,49], which is consistent with our findings. Moreover, in other coastal zones of China, for instance, Shankou of Guangxi province, Qi’ao island, and Shenzhen Bay, Spartina invasion has become one of the most serious threats to mangrove forest growth [41,45,50]. Spartina can become established in mudflats, easily resulting in the loss of suitable habitats which are available for mangrove forest reproduction [31,51]. Our results also showed that the Spartina area increased by 7.84 km2 with an ALCR of 100.13% from 1990 to 2017, with mudflats as the priority areas of encroachment (Table 4, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). Without effective systematic intervention, we posit that Spartina would gradually cover the entire intertidal mudflat and become an irrevocable threat to mangrove ecosystems. Figure 8a,b illustrates the inhibition of mangrove seedling growth by Spartina and its expansion in mudflats, respectively.Aquaculture development is another factor that has contributed to the losses of mangrove forest in the QBEWNR. Over the period 1990–2017, aquaculture ponds increased significantly by 3.57 km2 (Figure 5) and most were established in mudflat areas (Figure 4 and Figure 6). Diseases caused by aquaculture have a negative effect on mangrove forests [52]. The untreated water discharged by aquaculture can bring more pressures against the nutrient load in water bodies. Once the self-purification capacity of water bodies has been exceeded, the health of mangrove forests faces serious threats [53]. In addition, suitable habitat for mangrove forests was encroached upon by constructing aquaculture ponds in mudflats. Consequently, the losses of mangrove forests were due to aquaculture expansion to some extent. In previous studies, researchers have indicated that of the one-third of mangrove forests that have disappeared worldwide in the last 30 years, 35% was lost to aquaculture; this figure may reach 60% by 2030 [54,55]. Figure 8c,d displays aquaculture ponds located adjacent to mangrove forests and aquaculture development in mudflats, respectively.Due to their location in low coastal elevation areas, mangrove forests are particularly vulnerable to sea-level rise [56,57,58]. Previous research on sea-level change has reported that the sea-level of the Fujian coastal zone increased at an average rate of 2 mm/y during the last half century [59]. In response to rising sea-levels, mangrove forests are more likely to migrate landward [30,60]. However, such a landward migration and establishment has been obstructed by artificial seawalls in the study area (Figure 9), which meant that mangrove forests could only expand seaward. In addition, the roots of mangrove forests should be exposed to the air at a certain time, otherwise they would not be able to complete their own physiological processes and propagation [58,61,62]. As a result of sea-level rise, lower elevation areas would be inundated and waterlogged longer, which means mangrove forests would not meet the time required for mangrove root respiration, so mangrove forests cannot easily establish and propagate seaward.As shown in Figure 10, the annual average temperature and annual precipitation both increased in the QBEWNR from 1990 to 2017. Although a warmer and wetter climate would favor the establishment of mangrove forests [63], such climate change would promote sea-level rise, leading directly to the space loss of mangrove forest expansion seaward. Therefore, it is evident that, in the context of global warming, the potential for major coastal change aggravates the survival risk and pressures of seaward succession for mangrove forests. Overall, as for the study area, climate change and sea-level rise would potentially have adverse effects on mangrove forests.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Mangrove Forest Losses Associated by Human Activities and Possible Environmental Threats,4
79,"One notable caveat to these results is that the area of mangrove forests in the QBEWNR was only 0.09 km2 in 1990, had doubled to 0.18 km2 in 1997, and then declined to 0.16 km2 in 2005. These areas represent a limited distribution. Since 2005, mangrove forests have increased rapidly (Figure 5 and Figure 6). Under the ecological restoration schemes for coastal wetlands in Quanzhou Bay, various national and local ecological conservation projects have been carried out since 2000, including “National Wetland Conservation and Restoration”, “Marine Environment Ecological Restoration Project in Quanzhou Bay”, and “Mangrove Forest Restoration Project in Luoyang River” [64]. One of the common objectives for these ecological engineering projects is to cultivate and replant mangrove forests (i.e., reforestation projects) to increase mangrove forest area. According to the previous report [65], the afforestation area of mangrove forests was approximately 200 ha until 2015, indicating an 80%‒85% increase in mangrove forests because of the reforestation projects. Studies focusing on the mangrove forest dynamics in China from 1973 to 2015 had indicated that protection and reforestation actions had supported mangrove forest restoration greatly, which is consistent with our results [30]. Figure 8e,f demonstrates a monument of mangrove forest reforestation project and the mangrove seedling cultivation base, respectively.Although awareness of the need to protect mangrove forests has increased, the threats of Spartina invasion and the importance of Spartina control were recognized relatively late in China [30,66]. This probably explains why reforestation engineering was implemented in 2000, but the mangrove forests continued to decrease between 1997 and 2005 (Table 4). Since 2007, both national and local agencies have promoted the implementation and enforcement of Spartina control projects in the QBEWNR [67]. Up to 2017, the area of Spartina converted to mangrove forests had increased to 53.42 ha, including 7.20 ha from 2005 to 2010 and 46.22 ha from 2010 to 2017 (Table 5). Meanwhile, the annual expansion rate of Spartina had declined from 20.66% at the beginning of the same period, to 3.64% at the end. Moreover, the centroid distance between Spartina and mangrove forests has increased (Figure 7). Therefore, it can be inferred that, due to the management and control of Spartina, the disturbance caused by Spartina to mangrove forests has been mitigated to some degree. Figure 8g,h show the specific implementation scenario and subsequent effects of Spartina control, respectively.As mentioned above, whether through mangrove forest reforestation projects or Spartina control, the performance of conservation activities plays a substantial role in the existence and expansion of mangrove forests, which to a large extent neutralizes or offsets the losses of mangrove forests caused by negative factors.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Positive Effects of Reforestation Projects and Spartina Control,4
80,"Monitoring and dynamic change analysis for mangrove forests are critical for their conservation and management, and to help with formulating and implementing government policies [68,69]. The results from this study on the spatio-temporal change of mangrove forests and conversion between mangrove forests and other land cover types (Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6, Table 4 and Table 5) can be used as a guideline for conserving and managing mangrove forests.First, the implementation of artificial afforestation projects should be continued to increase the area of mangrove forests. Establishing a mangrove forest monitoring system is also indispensable and would allow for the elimination and control of insect pests and effective feedback on all aspects of mangrove forests. Meanwhile, cutting mangrove forests indiscriminately and disposing of rubbish within mangrove forests must be prohibited. Second, prevention and control of Spartina should be further studied, and more feasible measures should be taken to impede the expansion of Spartina in mudflats, with the aim of restoring suitable habitat for mangrove forests. For the zones in which Spartina has been eradicated, breeding conditions should be monitored regularly. Third, strict limitations on aquaculture development should be implemented in the reserve, and the pollution problems caused by aquaculture must be contained. Fourth, in focusing on the important ecological value of mangrove forests, local managers and conservationists should reinforce mangrove forest conservation by teaching local residents about the conservation implications and by disseminating information about the severe threats faced by mangrove forests.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Suggestions for Conserving and Managing Mangrove Forests,4
81,"So far, the primary segmentation scale determination approach is based on visual analysis, which is subjective and cannot effectively avoid over-segmentation and under-segmentation errors [70]. The optimal segmentation scale model used in our study not only gave a quantitative result, which is based on objective evaluation, but also kept better boundary consistency between the segmented image objects and real land cover types (Figure 3). Moreover, in the visual interpretation process, the manual modification of objects obtained using the optimal segmentation scale model was less than the objects generated through visual analysis determining the best scale, which improved classification efficiency and reduced the workload of interpreters.Classification accuracy can be improved by using the spectral difference among different land cover types effectively [71]. In this study, the spectral discrimination of mangrove forests, Spartina, and mudflats derived from seasonal change was given a full comparison and analysis, and we found that they were more accurately distinguished than in previous research [21,30,31]. Therefore, multi-seasonal images appear to be feasible and desirable data sources for monitoring mangrove forests located in subtropical areas. In tropical zones, owing to very small phenological differences, it may be difficult to discern spectral distinction between mangrove forests and Spartina. Accordingly, multi-seasonal images may not be applicable for mapping mangrove forests growing in tropical regions.Our analysis focused on mangrove forest dynamics over a long time series (from 1990 to 2017). This is significant for maintaining the spatial coherence of classification maps derived from various sensor images. Due to the spatial uncertainties that arose from the scanning system, wavelength setting, over-pass time, and angular effect, unbiased maps were difficult to produce. In addition, several uncertainties and limitations also existed in the segmentation parameter selection. Besides the segmentation scale, the shape and compactness variables, which respectively balance spectral homogeneity with the shape of the objects and the compactness with smoothness, are essential for controlling the clustering decision process of image objects. Although the optimal segmentation scale was determined objectively, the selection of other segmentation factors chosen by referencing previous research was subjective.", 4. Discussion, 4.4. Advantages and Uncertainties of the Methods for Mangrove Forest Monitoring,4
82,"Considering the importance of tidal information for mangrove forest monitoring and the spectral differences among mangrove forests, mudflats, and Spartina, several multi-seasonal Landsat images acquired during low tide were selected as the basic data sources. Combining an optimal segmentation scale model based on object-oriented classification, centroid migration calculations and spatial analysis, we discerned dynamic changes in the mangrove forest and their influencing factors in the QBEWNR from 1990 to 2017. Our results showed that there were some advantages for the approaches used in this study for mangrove forest monitoring, since the classification accuracy and efficiency of land cover map improved. Mangrove forests significantly expanded during the period of 1990–2017: the total area increased by 2.48 km2, with a dynamic degree of 102.06%. Most of the expanding mangrove forests transitioned from mudflats and Spartina. Mangrove forest changes were influenced by many factors. Environmental threats, including climate change and sea-level rise, Spartina invasion and aquaculture development exerted negative effects, while reforestation projects and Spartina control had a positive effect. In this study, the role of the latter was greater than the former. We demonstrated that conservation activities benefit the existence and expansion of mangrove forests. These conclusions can be used as a guide for governments and conservationists to make policies and effectively protect and monitor mangrove forests.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
83,"Trees grow by absorbing and using light, water, nutrients, and carbon dioxide, leading to accumulation of forest biomass. Thus, through carbon sequestration, forest biomass plays an important role in forest ecosystems and carbon cycling. Accurately estimating forest biomass is the basis of analyzing and understanding forest carbon dynamics and carbon cycling [1,2,3,4,5,6] and has been widely considered [7,8,9]. Obtaining total biomass of forests by field survey, including aboveground and belowground biomass, is very difficult and costly [1,2,3,5,6,10,11,12,13]. Because forest aboveground biomass (AGB) accounts for 70% to 90% of total forest biomass, most of the previous biomass studies focus on AGB [4,7,10,14,15].Due to the availability of spatial information and large and repeated coverage, various remotely sensed data are often combined with field data from sample plots for estimating, mapping, and monitoring forest AGB at large scales [7,16,17]. Because of the lower cost, optical images from the Landsat and Sentinel satellites have been most widely used for these purposes. However, saturation of spectral reflectance from highly dense and multi-layer canopy forests leads to underestimations of forest AGB, and mixtures of spectral reflectance from soil and vegetation result in overestimations of AGB for young forests. Radar and LiDAR data that characterize tree heights and forest canopy structures, to some extent, mitigate the effects of the data saturation and mixture of spectral reflectance from soil and vegetation [9,13,16,17,18,19,20]. However, the high cost limits their applications to large areas. In addition, compared with the analysis of optical images, processing radar data is often more complicated and computation intensive. Some authors have studied the use of combinations of different data sources but developing appropriate data fusion algorithms remains challenging [9,13,16,17,18,19,20]. Thus, using optical images is still a good alternative for mapping forest AGB for large areas. Reducing the uncertainties due to the fact of overestimations and underestimations are still a challenge.Various estimation methods, including parametric and non-parametric algorithms and machine learning methods, have been developed to reduce uncertainties in estimating forest AGB and to improve estimation accuracy using optical imagery based on strong correlations between spectral variables from the images and forest AGB [9,16]. Existing studies show that the determination coefficients (R2) between estimated and observed AGB values obtained by parametric models are often smaller than 0.5 [7,21]. Compared with parametric methods, non-parametric or machine learning approaches can lead to higher estimation accuracy because of their strong ability for fitting data, but they have a limited effect on improving AGB estimation because they are sensitive to sample designs (i.e., sample size and representativeness) [7,14]. Therefore, reducing uncertainties in estimating forest AGB using remotely sensed data is a great challenge [9,16,17,21] which has been widely recognized with substantial research conducted already [16,22,23]. The uncertainties are mainly caused by underestimations occurring in dense and multi-layered canopy and high biomass forests and by overestimations occurring in low biomass forests. Based on existing studies, underestimations often occur when forest AGB reaches 100 to 150 Mg/ha [9,21,24,25,26], and overestimations usually exist when AGB is less than 40 Mg/ha [9,21].The uncertainties may also be due to the fact of ignoring spatial effects represented by spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]. Existing studies have shown that forest AGB data are often characterized by spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity. Discarding spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity will lead to biases of AGB estimation [33,36,37,38,39].Spatial autocorrelation is the most commonly used method to account for spatial structure and distribution, such as random, clustering, and dispersion, and can be quantified at global and local levels [34,36]. Global spatial autocorrelation mainly describes the overall spatial structure and distribution of forest AGB, and Moran’s I [40], Geary’s C [41], and Getis’ G [42] statistics are commonly used [32,33,37]. Local spatial autocorrelation can test whether there are similar or dissimilar observations in local scales or determine the specific locations of “hot spots”, “cold spots”, and “outliers” [43,44,45], and local indicators of spatial association (LISA) [43], Moran’s Ii [40], and Getis’s Gi [42] are utilized.Spatial heterogeneity shows the uniqueness of each location relative to other locations [35,46,47,48,49]. In the area of forest AGB, it represents the spatial complexity, change of ecosystem characteristics, and spatial difference caused by the non-random distribution of forest vegetation [38,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56]. The methods used to evaluate and measure the spatial heterogeneity vary depending on the features of the spatial data including random index, aggregated index, nearest distance, trend surface, spectrum analysis, variation function, fractal dimension, analysis of variance ratio, correlation analysis, variation function, etc. [57,58,59,60,61,62]. Spatial autocorrelation and spatial regression models can also be used to analyze the spatial heterogeneity, especially the local autocorrelation [40,41,42,43]. Spatial regressions, particularly geographically weighted regression (GWR) models, are the most commonly used method to analyze spatial heterogeneity [32,33,46,47].Because incorporating spatial effect analysis into regression models has no requirement for independent data, spatial regression models have been widely applied to improve understanding of forest distributions and estimation accuracy of forest parameters [32,37,38,39,44,45,63,64,65,66,67]. Corresponding to quantifying spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity, globally and locally spatial regressions are used [37,38,39,44,63,66,67,68,69,70,71,72]. Spatial lag model (SLM), spatial error model (SEM), and spatial Durbin model (SDM) are the three most commonly used global models [34,37,39,65,66,67], while GWR is the most frequently used local spatial regression model [38,39,64,69,70,71,72]. Moreover, a mixed-effects model, including fixed effects and random effects, is also a commonly used spatial regression model, considering spatial autocorrelation in variance and covariance structures of the model [32,39,67]. Some authors have also employed spatial regression models, especially GWR, for estimating forest AGB using remote sensing data, with the modification of GWR by incorporating altitude information [13,73]. But, the authors ignored spatial effect analysis of AGB from sample plot data and model residuals. It was also unclear how the spatial regression models reduced overestimations and underestimations that often occur in forests with small and large AGB values, respectively. In addition, there have been no reports that deal with the analysis of the characteristics of spatial regression models and the differences of their contributions in reducing overestimations and underestimations.The objective of this study was to present a method to improve mapping AGB for Pinus densata forests located in Yunnan of Southwest China. Both the spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity of Pinus densata forest AGB data were first analyzed. Four spatial models, including SLM, SEM, linear mixed-effects model (LMM), and GWR, were then compared to estimate the forest AGB using Landsat 8 OLI imagery. Ordinary least squares (OLS) was also selected for comparison as a non-spatial model. The performance of the model fitting and prediction and the spatial effects of the residuals were evaluated for the five models. This study answers the following questions: (1) Can the spatial effect analysis be ignored for forest AGB estimation based on remote sensing data? (2) Do spatial models greatly reduce over- and underestimations in predictions? and (3) What are the differences in the contributions of the different spatial models to the reduction of the over- and underestimations of the predictions?", 1.

84,"In this study, the Pinus densata forests in Shangri-La City, northwest Yunnan Province, Southwest China were selected (Figure 2). The area is in the cold temperate zone with a monsoon climate. The altitude of Shangri-La City ranges from 1503 m to 5545 m above sea level. The high altitudes lead to sunny but chilly winters. This study area has an average annual temperature of 5.4 °C with the coldest and hottest months in December and July, respectively. There is an average annual precipitation of 607 mm with 70% of rainfall in June to September. The relative humidity is 70%, and the evaporation is 1671 mm. Dark brown forest soil and cold temperate coniferous forests are commonly found with dominant tree species of Abies, Pinus, Larix, and Picea [26].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area,2
85,"As a typical cool temperature coniferous tree species, Pinus densata forests are mainly distributed in sub-alpine and alpine areas with altitudes of 2800 m to 3700 m in the Hengduan Mountains. The Pinus densata forests of single tree species and canopy layer are common in this area. Even in the mixed forests, the dominant tree species often is Pinus densata with Picea likiangensis, Pinus armandii, Quercus pannosa, Betula spp. and Larix potaninii var. macrocarpa mixed [26,74].", 2.

86,"A total of one hundred and forty-seven 30 m square sample plots were measured in 2016 (Figure 2). The plots were sampled with a distance of about 1 km based on the different stand ages, elevations, slopes, and aspects [26]. These factors were determined using a spatial distribution map of Pinus densata forests. In the map, forest compartments that had a homogeneous stand age, tree species composition, and canopy structures, elevations, slopes, and aspects were generated in the field using aerial photographs by visual interpretation. Within each plot, the plot coordinates, elevation, slope, and aspect were obtained. The tree variables including tree species, diameter at breast height (1.3 m) (DBH), and height (H) were measured and used to calculate tree biomass.Because there were no tree biomass models available for Pinus densata forests, in this study, a sample tree was selected from each of the sample plots based on its average DBH and H. In order to reduce the cost, the selection of the sample trees was discarded for the sample plots that had similar characteristics of stand parameters. Thus, a total of 100 sample trees were obtained. Each sample tree was cut and the wood, bark, branches, needle biomass, H, and DBH were measured. The 3 cm thick disks were taken at a 2 m interval along each trunk and the volume was calculated. The disks were dried by oven to a constant weight at 105 °C and weighted. The sample density was obtained using a drainage method. At the same time, the volumes of wood and bark for each sample tree were calculated using 2 m segments and diameters without bark in every segment and then converted to biomass based on the sample density. Sample branches were graded and collected to weight the leaves and branches. A similar method was used to dry the branch and leaf samples. The biomass values of branches and leaves were yielded using the fresh weight and dry matter ratio. Summing the biomass values of woods, barks, branches, and leaves led to the total biomass of each sample tree. The power function was used to fit individual tree AGB data, resulting in following equation of tree biomass.

AGB = 0.073·DBH1.739·H0.880


(1)

The model had an R2 value of 0.992 and a root mean square error (RMSE) value of 30.778 kg, and it was used to estimate the AGB value of each Pinus densata tree in each of the plots. Equation (2) was employed to obtain the AGB of every plot that was then transferred to the value per hectare. The plot data were randomly divided into a fitting dataset of 117 plots and a test dataset of 30 plots (Table 1). This division of the dataset was conducted mainly considering that, in this study, there were relatively complex topographic features and a relatively great coefficient of variation (52.5%) for the forest AGB. Using a large sample size for model fitting can offer an opportunity of providing accurate estimates of AGB. At the same time, the test dataset should not significantly differ statistically from the fitting dataset in terms of their sample means and standard deviation. In fact, the random division led to a relatively great difference of the average AGB values between the fitting dataset and test dataset, but their sample means and standard deviations were not significantly different statistically from each other based on the student t-test distribution and F test at the significance level of 0.05. Thus, the division of the dataset would not significantly affect the conclusions drawn from the fitting and test datasets.

87,"In the present study, three Landsat 8 OLI images were downloaded from the website of the United States Geological Survey, and their image IDs are LC81310412016005LGN00, LC18320402016012LGN00, and LC81320412016012LGN00. There was a Universal Transverse Mercator coordinate system with zone 47 north in the images [26]. The images were mosaicked into one image and clipped using the shape file of the study area (Figure 2). The dark object subtraction approach was used to conduct atmospheric calibration of the mosaicked image [75], and the C-correction approach was utilized to carry out topographic correction using digital elevation model data at a spatial resolution of 30 m × 30 m [76,77].A total of 253 remote sensing variables were extracted by ARCGIS including 7 bands, 22 vegetation indices, and 224 textural measures. The bands consisted of Band1—coastal aerosol, band2—blue (BLU), band3—green (GRN), band4—red (RED), band5—near infrared (NIR), band6—shortwave infrared 1 (SWIR1), and band7—shortwave infrared 2 (SWIR2). The 22 vegetation indices were consistent with those in the study by Ou et al. [26], including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), simple ratio index (RVI), difference vegetation index (DVI), perpendicular vegetation index (PVI), two soil adjusted vegetation indices, brightness, greenness and temperature vegetation indices, atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI), modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), etc. In addition, a total of 224 grey-level co-occurrence matrix-based texture measures including mean, angular second moment, contrast, correlation, dissimilarity, entropy, homogeneity, and variance were derived using moving windows of 3 × 3, 5 × 5, 7 × 7 and 9 × 9 pixels, respectively. The objective of using the vegetation indices and texture measures was to capture the characteristics of the forest canopy structure and textures [26,78,79]. Pearson correlation analysis between the remote sensing variables and AGB were carried out using SPSS 18.0 for Windows, and the spectral variables with significant correlation (p ≤ 0.05) were selected to build the AGB estimation models [26,72].", 2.

Moreover, the Moran’s I with different bandwidths was used to make a line chart, and the spatial autocorrelation with the change of lag distance was investigated. Each observed plot should have at least one adjacent plot to ensure the analysis results are valid. In this study, the minimum adjacent distance among the plots was 74 m, the average distance was 1082 m, and the maximum distance was 6287 m. Therefore, the initial bandwidth was set to be 6000 m for the global autocorrelation analysis.The Anselin local Moran’s Ii was used to show the local distributions and patterns of the plot AGB [39,81].

In this study, the OLS led to a greater AIC value than the four spatial models with the AIC difference between each of the four spatial models and the OLS being greater than three. Moreover, OLS had a smaller R2 value and a greater RMSE value than the four spatial models. Those indicated that the spatial regression models had significantly better performance for model fitting than OLS. The GWR had the greatest R2 (0.665) and the smallest values of AIC (1199.341) and RMSE (34.507), followed by LMM, SLM, SEM, and OLS based on the R2 values from high to low and the RMSE and AIC values from low to high. Thus, the GWR had the best performance for fitting, followed by LMM, SLM, SEM, and OLS.Based on the test dataset (Table 4), the values for ME, MAE, MRE, and MARE of the five models showed a similar order of prediction performance as the AIC and RMSE obtained based on the model fitting dataset. The GWR had smaller values of ME, MAE, MRE, and MARE than LMM, SLM, SEM, and OLS. At the significance level of 0.10, the values of ME and MRE from GWR were significantly smaller than those from OLS, SEM, and SLM but not than those from LMM. Moreover, the significant difference of MAE only existed between GWR and OLS and between GWR and SLM, not between GWR and SEM, and between GWR and LMM. In addition, the value of MARE from GWR was significantly smaller than those from SLM and LMM but not than those from OLS and SEM.Table 5 shows the estimates of the regression coefficients and the corresponding standard errors for the models OLS, SEM, SLM, and LMM and the mean regression coefficients and their ranges for GWR. For the four models, OLS, SEM, SLM, and LMM, the constant values differed from each other, but their standard errors were similar. For the same spectral variables, the values of the regression coefficients and their standard errors from OLS, SEM, SLM, and LMM were similar to each other, and the OLS had slightly larger absolute values of regression coefficients while LMM had slightly smaller absolute values of regression coefficients. Moreover, the average values of the regression coefficients from GWR were also similar to those of the other three spatial models, but the regression coefficients from GWR had wide ranges, indicating that the GWR model produced local spatial variability of the regression coefficients and, thus, forest AGB [32,67].In Figure 6, the scatter graphs of the observed and predicted AGB values for the five models are shown to indicate the fitting performance. The GWR had the greatest value of R2, followed by LMM, SLM, OLS, and SEM. The overestimations and underestimations were obviously noticed for OLS, SEM, SLM, and LMM when the observed AGB was smaller than 70 Mg/ha and larger than 150 Mg/ha, respectively, and GWR greatly reduced the overestimations and underestimations by decreasing the interval of AGB values for the overestimations occurring and increasing the threshold greater than which the underestimations started to take place.The maps of the predicted AGB values for Shangri-La City were generated using five models in Figure 7. The spatial distributions of the predicted AGB values looked similar to each other. But, by reducing the over- and underestimations, the map by GWR was more heterogeneous than those by OLS, SEM, SLM, and LMM.", 3. Results, 3.2. Model Performance,3
102,"In order to quantitatively compare the estimates using different models, the means and standard deviations of residuals from the model predictions of AGB were calculated for the overall and different AGB classes based on the test dataset. All the models led to similar trends in the residuals (Table 6). With the increase in AGB values, the means of the residuals changed from larger positive values (serious overestimations) to smaller positive values (slight overestimations), smaller negative values (slight underestimations), and large negative values (serious underestimations), while the standard deviations varied slightly. The overestimations and underestimations were the smallest for the AGB classes of 80 Mg/ha to 120 Mg/ha and 120 Mg/ha to 160 Mg/ha, and the largest for the AGBB classes of <40 Mg/ha and >200 Mg/ha, respectively, for all the models. The overestimations were obviously noticed when the AGB values were smaller than 80 Mg/ha, while the underestimations occurred when the AGB values were greater than 160 Mg/ha. For all models, the overall averages of the residuals were not significantly different from zero at the significance level of 0.05. Moreover, for the same class of AGB, GWR had the smallest absolute means of residuals for each of the AGB classes among the five models, although the overall average residual was the largest. The absolute means of the residuals from OLS, SEM, and SLM were not obviously different from each other, and, compared among these three models, LMM had a slightly smaller absolute mean.", 3. Results, 3.3. Characteristics of Residuals with AGB Classes,3
103,"The five models were assessed by examining the distributions of the residuals from the modeling dataset (Table 7). The OLS, SEM, SLM, and LMM had similar and large ranges of residuals. The OLS, SLM, and SEM produced positive skewness and negative kurtosis for their distributions of residuals with similar averages and standard deviations. Compared with OLS, SEM, and SLM, the LMM had a smaller standard deviation with negative skewness and kurtosis. The GWR yielded the smallest range and standard deviation of the residuals with a positive skewness and kurtosis. 3.4.1. Spatial Autocorrelation of the Model ResidualsThe global Moran’s I values of the five models with different lag distances are shown in Figure 8. Both OLS and SEM had larger absolute values of Moran’s I than SLM, LMM, and GWR. With the increase in lag distances, the absolute values of Moran’s I for all five models decreased, and the differences in the Moran’s I values among the models also decreased. The differences were not obvious when the lag distance reached 100 km.The five models were fit at the bandwidth of 7.5 km. The global Moran’s I values and the corresponding Z scores for the residuals from OLS, SEM, SLM, LMM, and GWR are listed in Table 8. The Z scores were significantly positive (Z-values > 1.96) for OLS and SEM, indicating that the three models produced similar clustering patterns for the prediction residuals at a significance level of 0.05. The Z score for SLM is positive, and the values both GWR and LMM were negative, and their absolute values were smaller than 1.96.The statistics for the local Moran’s Ii values of the prediction residuals for the five models are listed in Table 9. The local Moran’s Ii values of the models had negative skewness but positive kurtosis. The OLS, SLM, and SEM had similar averages, standard deviations, skewness, and kurtosis, and the means of the local Moran’s Ii values were positive and greater than the corresponding absolute values from LMM and GWR. The ranges in the local Moran’s Ii values from OLS, SLM, and SEM were also greater compared with those from the other two models. The LMM model yielded the smallest range, standard deviation, and absolute mean value of local Moran’s Ii. The GWR had a smaller standard deviation and the greatest absolute skewness and kurtosis values.Figure 9 presents the local spatial autocorrelation characteristics of the prediction residuals based on the local Moran’s Ii values for the five models. For the prediction residuals of OLS, SEM, and SLM, the hot spots (high–high clustering) were found at the southwest central part of the study area, while the cold spots were noticed at the west central part with low–high outliers located at the southwest central part. The LMM only led to one hot spot, one cold spot, and one low–high outlier; the GWR resulted in one cold spot and a few outliers but no hot spots.Table 10 lists the statistical parameters of the Z scores for the five models. Out of 117 sample plots, 98, 99, and 103 plots had no significant spatial autocorrelation of the model residuals with |Z| values smaller than 1.96 for OLS, SEM, and SLM, respectively; more than 110 plots for GWR and LMM did not show significantly spatial autocorrelation of the prediction residuals. Moreover, the number of plots with significant spatial autocorrelation of the residuals with |Z| ≥ 1.96 from OLS, SEM, SLM, LMM, and GWR were 19, 18, 14, 3, and 5, respectively. This implies that, compared with OLS, SEM and SLM, the spatial models LMM and GWR greatly reduced the spatial autocorrelation of the residuals. 3.4.2. Spatial Heterogeneity of the Model ResidualsThe intra-block variances of the prediction residuals from the five models’ given block sizes are shown in Figure 10. All five models showed a similar trend of variance change, in that the variances became larger as the block size increased and approached a stable level when the block size was large enough. Moreover, the OLS, SLM, SEM, and LMM had similar and much larger intra-block variances of the residuals across all lag distances, and the stable variances were obtained when the block size was approximately 30 km. The variances of the residuals from GWR were the smallest at all lag distances, and the variances started to tend to stable when the block size was approximately 16 km.", 3. Results, 3.4.

Spatial Heterogeneity of the Model Residuals,3
106,"We investigated both the spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity of AGB for Pinus densata forests from the sample plot data and found that the spatial effects should not be ignored when estimating the AGB using remote sensing images. The spatial autocorrelation occurred among the AGB plots because 13.61% of the plots were high–high or low–low clustering. But, there were fewer clustering points of the prediction residuals for the spatial regression models than OLS. Especially, LMM and GWR had more points which had no significant spatial autocorrelation, indicating that the spatial autocorrelation and the impact could be greatly reduced by the two spatial regression models. Moreover, the spatial heterogeneity could be found and the intra-block variances became larger as the block size increased. Although the spatial variability can also be decomposed into intra-block variance, inter-block variance, and total spatial variance [32,82,84], intra-block variance is often used to quantify the local spatial heterogeneity [32,82,84,91,92,93,94]. This study showed that four spatial regression models had smaller intra-block variances than OLS at the same lag distance. Especially, GWR greatly reduced the intra-block variances and improved the estimation of AGB compared with the other four models. This indicated that the spatial heterogeneity should not be ignored for the estimation of AGB using remote sensing images and that GWR could more effectively account for the spatial heterogeneity.Moreover, it is of great importance for spatial effect analysis to select the proper bandwidths. The coefficient estimates of the spatial models may change and lead to different model performance [67]. In general, large and small bandwidths should be used for sparsely and densely distributed data, respectively [86,94,95,96]. In this study, we calculated the Global Moran’s I values and the corresponding Z-values of AGB plot data with lag distances from 6 km to 100 km. Overall, both the global Moran’s I and Z-values decreased gradually. The Z score values were greater than 1.96 when the distance was smaller than 76 km, and they were smaller than 1.96 after 76 km. Correspondingly, the positive Moran’s I values turned negative at a distance of 76 km. More importantly, as the distance increased, the Moran’s I values increased at the beginning and reached the first peak point with a value of 0.1450 (Z score = 6.0228) at the distance of 7.5 km, and the lag distance corresponding to the first peak point could be used as the bandwidth of the spatial regression models [36]. Therefore, the lag distance was selected for the spatial analysis and spatial regression, indicating the existence of significantly positive spatial autocorrelation and a clustering distribution for AGB of the plots.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Spatial Effects,4
107,"This study showed that all the spatial regression models had better performance for model fitting and prediction for Pinus densata forest AGB compared with the non-spatial regression model OLS. This was mainly because there were significantly global and local spatial autocorrelations and spatial heterogeneities of AGB, and OLS lacked the ability to account for these spatial characteristics.Among the spatial regression models, the performance of model fitting and prediction varied depending on the features of the landscape and models. In this study, GWR provided the greatest estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.665, RMSE = 34.507, MARE = 40.1%) of the forest AGB for both model fitting and test datasets, followed by LMM. Both SEM and SLM had similar and slightly better performances than OLS but poorer performances than GWR and LMM. The differences in the performances among the spatial regression models might result from the principles of the model development and the characteristics of the used data. The SLM is a formal representation of a spatial diffusion process which reflects the spatial dependence in the data and focuses on the assessment of the spatial dependence [32]. The SEM is developed based on the spatial autoregressive model with errors on the premise of no change for the explanatory variables [32,33], and it is assumed that the spatial autoregressive process occurs only in the error term, neither in the response variable nor in the predictor variables [64,97]. In short, although both the SEM and SLM models can explain the global spatial autocorrelation, they cannot deal with local spatial heterogeneity [33]. In fact, in this study, there was a global spatial autocorrelation of the AGB, but the spatial autocorrelation was only significant in a few portions of the study area. There were 86.39% of the plots and 83.76% of the prediction residuals from OLS in which the plot AGB and residual values were not significantly spatially autocorrelated with each other. On the other hand, in only 14% to 16% of the plots did significant spatial autocorrelation of AGB existed. Therefore, SLM and SEM might be selected to explain the spatial effect of the AGB plots. However, the improvement in the AGB estimation was limited.The LMM had better performance than SEM and SLM and offered more accurate estimates of AGB by taking into account the effects of spatial autocorrelation with the spatial covariance structure and random effects incorporated [32,98]. The LMM can deal with both spatial autocorrelation and heterogeneity. However, the capacity for explaining spatial heterogeneity depends on random effects. In this study, the study area was considered to have random effects and LMM could, to some extent, account for the spatial heterogeneity, but it could not completely explain the spatial variation of the plot AGB. Moreover, LMM lacks the ability of accounting for the spatial variability due to the multiple random effects from environmental factors and forest heterogeneity. For this purpose, a good alternative is to use multi-level mixed-effects models. The GWR can not only accommodate spatial heterogeneity, but can also take into account spatial autocorrelation of AGB [39,46,72,95]. The results of prediction residuals from GWR showed that the spatial autocorrelation of the model residuals and the intra-block variances were greatly reduced compared with those from LMM, SLM, and SEM. This implied that GWR provided a powerful tool to potentially improve the estimation of AGB using remote sensing data. However, it has to be pointed out that all the models cannot explain in what way and how the estimation of AGB is affected by the factors.The GWR led to the most accurate estimates of Pinus densata forest AGB in this study. This does not mean that it will certainly work better than other methods for all study areas. Chen et al. [15] found that support vector machine for regression performed better than GWR in the estimation of forest AGB in the center of the Changbai Mountains of China using sentinel imagery. This may be mainly due to the fact that the performance of the models often varies depending on the characteristics of the relationships between forest AGB and predictors and the ability of the models to model the relationships, sample sizes, and representative sample data for AGB populations. Non-parametric or machine learning models, such as artificial neural networks and support vector machine, may have stronger capacities to estimate forest AGB when there are complex non-linear relationships between predictors and forest AGB [9]. But almost all non-parametric methods are sensitive to the characteristics of sample data. When a sample size is small and its representativeness of the population is poor, non-parametric methods will have a weak predictive ability [9]. Non-parametric methods also lack the ability to offer a clear mathematical relationship, as the parametric models analyze the spatial effects. On the other hand, parametric methods, such as GWR, often have stronger predictive ability with clearer mathematical explanations than the non-parametric methods and are not as sensitive to the characteristics of the sample data for estimation of forest AGB. In addition, GWR often works better than most traditional non-spatial parametric models and global spatial regression models because of its strong ability for modeling spatial autocorrelation and spatially heterogeneous processes at local scales [53].", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Model comparison,4
108,"Over- and underestimations commonly exist in the estimation of forest AGB using remote sensing images. This study showed that the spatial effects of the plot AGB data that lead to overestimation and underestimation could not be ignored, and that the spatial regression models can improve the estimation accuracy of Pinus densata forest AGB. However, not all of the spatial regression models could significantly reduce the over- and underestimations. The major challenge for biomass estimation using optical imagery is the uncertainties from the underestimations in forests with high AGB and the overestimations in forests with low AGB [17,24,25,78]. Many studies have indicated that the uncertainties are relevant to forest ecosystems, topographic characteristics, remote sensing data, etc. [24,78,99,100,101,102,103,104]. In this study, SLM, SEM, and LMM had thresholds of overestimations and the underestimations similar to those of OLS, indicating that the three spatial regression models could not significantly reduce the uncertainties from the over- and underestimations. Compared with OLS, SEM, SLM, and LMM, the GWR significantly increased the estimation accuracy of Pinus densata forest AGB by lowering the threshold of overestimations and increasing the threshold of underestimations. Particularly, the overestimations from GWR in this study did not look obvious. The GWR is thus a powerful tool for reducing the uncertainties due to the overestimations and underestimations of forest AGB using remote sensing data and for increasing the estimation accuracy mainly because GWR takes into account both the spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity of AGB.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Overestimation and Underestimation,4
109,"Several studies have been conducted to map AGB of Pinus densata forests in a similar area using Landsat images. In order to make a consistent comparison, the MARE values of the model predictions obtained based on the test datasets were mainly employed. Yue [105] compared a linear regression, artificial neural network, and support vector machine for regression with 147 sample plots measured in 2008 and Landsat images acquired in 2008 and 2009 to estimate Pinus densata forests AGB and obtained the MARE values of 26.36%, 23.31%, and 19.65%, respectively. Sun [106] estimated AGB of Pinus densata forests using a stepwise regression, a three-order polynomial regression, a system of equations, random forests, and Cubist with 57 sample plots and Landsat images obtained in 2014, and yielded MARE values of 51.3%, 48.2%, 51.7%, 15.4%, and 45.3%, respectively. Ou et al. [26] further explored the improvement of estimating Pinus densata forest AGB in this study area using a linear regression, a linear regression with combined variables, an artificial neural network, and random forests and produced the relative RMSE values of 45.5%, 48.5%, 38.5%, and 31.5%, respectively. By adding the age dummy variable into the models, the authors then reduced the corresponding relative RMSE values to 27.0%, 27.3%, 23.9%, and 21.5%. In this study, OLS, SEM, SLM, LMM, and GWR led to MARE values of 41.1%, 40.5%, 44.1%, 44.9%, and 40.1%, respectively. This implies that the results of this study were only compatible with those from the previous studies. However, the emphasis of this study was put on the consideration of spatial dependency and heterogeneity by GWR and, thus, on the reduction of overestimations and underestimations for forests with small and large values of AGB, respectively.The results of all the relevant studies indicate that the accuracies of the model predictions vary greatly. The significant differences may be caused by the different datasets used, the different number of sample plots, the different quality of images, the different spectral variables, etc. First of all, the studies were conducted using different datasets collected from different times, and the forest canopy structures might have changed due to the natural factors such as diseases and insects as well as human activities such as clear-cutting. The studies used different sample sizes for model calibration and tests. Sun [106] employed field data collected in 2014 from a total of 56 sample plots with 39 plots for model fitting and 17 for model test and yielded the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between AGB and the used spectral variables ranging 0.324 to 0.468. In the study by Sun [106], overall, the obtained estimation accuracies were lower than those in this study except for random forest that led to a higher accuracy of 84.6%. However, the sample sizes used by Sun [106] for both model calibration and tests were too small. The small sample sizes might have led to significantly higher correlations of AGB with the spectral variables than those in the other studies of this area.Yue [105] utilized a total of 147 sample plots with 101 plots for model fitting and 46 plots for model tests which were similar to those used in this study. However, the study by Yue [105] had significantly higher estimation accuracies than those in this study. The main reason might be because, in those models, the used spectral variables had greater absolute coefficients of correlation with AGB, ranging from 0.227 to 0.381, compared with the corresponding values from 0.200 to 0.326 in this study. The spectral variables with higher correlations in the study by Yue [105] included a shadow fraction derived by a spectral unmixing analysis and three skewness texture measures. The shadow fraction improved the estimation of AGB mainly because it characterized the impacts of shadows due to the large differences in the elevation and topographic complexity of the mountainous area. The skewness texture measures accounted for the feature of spatial distribution from the spectral reflectance values of Pinus densata forest canopy structures in this area. In this study, although two correlation texture measures, one angular second moment and one dissimilarity texture measure were selected to develop the models, the skewness texture measures and shadow fraction were not involved. This implies that the skewness texture measures and shadow fraction provide the potential to improve the estimation accuracy of Pinus densata forest AGB in this area and should be included in the estimation models to further increase the prediction accuracy in the future study.Based on the relevant studies [26,105,106], it is commonly found that support vector machine and random forests provide the most accurate estimates of Pinus densata forest AGB. However, both methods theoretically are highly sensitive to sample size and representativeness [7,9] and require a large sample size which will lead to high cost. Both methods are also less generalizable and lack transferability for future use. Generalization and transferability will greatly enhance the application of the models. Moreover, adding the age as a dummy variable into the models showed the great potential for increasing the estimation accuracy of Pinus densata forest AGB [26]. However, the spatially explicit values of the forest stand age are usually not available which limits the application of the method. Overall, obtaining a high estimation accuracy of Pinus densata forest AGB in this area is very challenging mainly due to the fact of its complex landscape and topography and great differences in elevation. To further improve the estimation of Pinus densata forest AGB, attention should be paid to the selection of methods that can account for spatial dependency and spatial heterogeneity and which have strong capacity for prediction and transferability. At the same time, the emphasis should also be put on the selection of image texture measures and spatial features that can characterize the complexity of the landscape and topography in this area and the canopy structures of Pinus densata forests. Thus, it is expected the integration of GWR with the significantly correlated texture measures and shadow and vegetation fractions would offer greater potential for improving the estimation of Pinus densata forest AGB.", 4.

110,"This research focused on improving the estimation of Pinus densata forest AGB using remote sensing images and spatial regression models. In this study, the spatial effects of Pinus densata forest AGB in the Yunnan Province of China was analyzed and quantified based on the fitting and test datasets from 117 and 30 sample plots, respectively, and Landsat 8-OLI images. As expected, GWR had the best performance with the largest R2 (0.665) and the smallest RMSE (34.507) and MARE (40.1%), followed by LMM, SLM, SEM, and OLS. More importantly, this study led to the following new conclusions: (1) spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity should not be ignored for AGB estimation using remote sensing data, and the impacts of spatial effect can be reduced by the spatial regressions; (2) given a forest landscape, the ability of the spatial regression models to reduce the uncertainties from over- and underestimations varies depending on the characteristics of the models; (3) the obtained AGB intervals smaller than 70 Mg/ha and larger than 150 Mg/ha for the over- and underestimations, respectively, were similar for SLM, SEM, and OLS. Compared with the other models, both LMM and GWR decreased the uncertainties from the over- and underestimations, but the decrease in the uncertainties was significant when using GWR and not when using LMM. Especially, GWR did not lead to overestimations and, at the same time, increased the threshold of the underestimations from 150 Mg/ha to 200 Mg/ha. Thus, the GWR method provides great potential for improving the estimation of forest AGB using Landsat 8 images.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
111,"Riparian ecosystems are ecotones where rivers and upland areas influence one another. They host specific plant communities related to water proximity and availability, soil anoxia or flood disturbance. They are home to an exceptional biodiversity [1], and riparian vegetation produces numerous ecosystem services concerning water quality, flow regulation or erosion mitigation [2]. However, they are subject to multiple pressures and have been degraded in many regions of the world [3]. Consequently, there has been a particular interest for several decades in the conservation or restoration of these ecosystems [4].Dybala et al. [5] and Matzek et al. [6] pointed out that carbon storage for climate change mitigation could be a co-benefit of conservation or restoration policies that promote biodiversity. Indeed, vegetation biomass, which is one of the largest compartments for carbon storage in riparian ecosystems [7], is related to other key biophysical functions of riparian ecosystems. For example, vegetation biomass drives the production of large woody debris, which is a key process influencing habitat complexity, hydraulic and sedimentary processes [8,9]. Vegetation biomass also has tremendous effects on nutrient cycling in the ecosystem [10,11]. More generally, biomass is a component of forest structure, which itself influences sediment stabilization [12], hydraulic roughness [13] or habitat provisioning [14].The amount of biomass in riparian vegetation depends primarily on productivity, vegetation type (e.g., tree longevity or wood density) and disturbance regime. Productivity of riparian vegetation is notably influenced by the interplay between water availability [15], soil anoxia occurring as a result of flooding or proximity to the water table [16,17] or nutrient-rich sediment brought in during floods [18]. Disturbances related to flooding and erosion [19], beavers [20], livestock [21], or anthropogenic disturbances related to agriculture and forestry [22,23,24] notably reduce vegetation biomass. The aforementioned factors also influence the type of vegetation that establishes in one place, which in turn determines potential biomass storage, for example through tree longevity [18]. However, knowledge is lacking on how these factors interact to shape vegetation biomass distribution, and few studies have been carried out in Europe [2,7,14]. Moreover, there is a lack of allometric equations for estimating tree biomass in riparian forests [25].Remote sensing is widely used for estimating biomass over wide areas in a spatially continuous manner [26,27]. However, most studies in the riparian context have been limited to reaches a few kilometers long [28], and used spectral data in classification-based approaches [25,29,30]. Such approaches do not take into account the great spatial variability and continuum between different vegetation types in riparian systems. LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data have several advantages over spectral data for biomass estimation. They are less subject to saturation [31,32,33,34], and are suitable for direct biomass modeling [35]. LiDAR data can be used to build digital terrain models (DTMs), which allow the heterogeneous topography of the riparian zone under the canopy to be observed, unlike spectral data. They are increasingly available, and have a strong potential for upscaling biomass estimates over hundreds to thousands kilometers of rivers [28]. LiDAR data are often used as point clouds, where each point corresponds to a LiDAR return. This method requires some skills and is computationally intensive, but it enables studying the internal structure of the canopy [36]. For simplicity, LiDAR data are often preprocessed as a raster format CHM (Canopy Height Model), where each pixel represents the height of the canopy top. LiDAR data have proven to be effective for estimating biomass in different forest types [37] and in a riparian context [38]. As compared to other forests, riparian forests have an original structure with multi-stemmed trees and shrubs [39], high species diversity [40], and a complex landscape organization with many linear patches. In this context, the high 2D and 3D resolution of LiDAR is a definite advantage, and biomass is preferably estimated using object-based approaches (with objects corresponding to trees or groups of trees), which are expected to improve performance and simplify field sampling in fragmented landscapes [41].Although promising, to our knowledge, object-oriented approaches based on LiDAR data have not been used to estimate biomass in riparian forests. Moreover, remote sensing has not been used to improve understanding of spatial distribution of biomass patterns in riparian ecosystems according to geomorphic and anthropogenic factors (related studies include [29,42], who used satellite data to map vegetation greenness in relation to geomorphic factors). The objectives of this article were as follows:To propose an approach to estimate aboveground biomass at tree level, and to compare two biomass estimates based on variables from a raster-format LiDAR CHM or from the original LiDAR point cloud;To highlight environmental factors structuring biomass distribution in riparian forests at a sub-regional scale (200 km of river and their riparian zone) in the context of low-energy temperate rivers (Meuse catchment, Western Europe).", 1. Introduction,None,1.
112,"The study area is located in Wallonia (southern Belgium), within the Meuse catchment area (Figure 1). It is a publicly managed area, comprising about 200 km of rivers mapped from the point where their catchment area reaches 50 km2. The studied rivers drain an area of about 1200 km2. Public management in the study area is limited to the bankfull channel of rivers, as well as vegetation or other structures in the channel. It encompasses all actions needed in the channel to promote its hydraulic, ecological and social functions such as logjam removal, bank reinforcement, riparian planting, etc. The study area can be divided into two main sub-basins. In the northern part of the study area, the Semois and its tributaries have a gravel bed, a gentle slope and frequently overflow in winter. Downstream, the Semois produces broad, steeply sloping meanders [43]. In the southern part, the Ton and its tributaries have sandy beds, flow into clayey plains and have a hydrological regime dominated by base flow. On the whole, these rivers have little activity and flow in a landscape of forests and meadows, where riparian forests are often reduced to a row of trees along the river. The most frequent tree species are alders (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertner) and willows (including Salix alba x fragilis L., S. viminalis L., S. caprea L. and S. aurita L.), which are often multi-stemmed. Maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), oak (Quercus robur L.) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) are also common. Finally, even-aged spruce plantations (Picea abies (L.) Karst) can be found in the valley bottoms.The area was covered during the winter of 2014 by an aerial LiDAR survey. The survey was ordered by the Walloon administration over the entire Wallonia. The initial aim was to produce a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) that could then be used for multiple purposes. The acquisition was performed with a Riegl Litemapper 6800i, with a pulse repetition rate of 150 kHz and a maximum scan angle of 60°. The flight altitude ranged from 1200 to 1500 m AGL and the flight speed was 75 m/s. Average point density was 0.8 to 1 ground return/m2. Point positions were corrected during post-processing using ground references, and the mean absolute error in planimetry was 0.12 m. The point cloud was classified using full wave and morphological analysis. One-meter-resolution DTM and DSM (digital surface model) were created using a Natural Neighbor interpolation, using points classified as “ground” and points with maximum altitude, respectively. Data were provided as a point cloud with a non-normalized intensity and as 1-m-resolution DTM and DSM. A CHM was created by subtracting the DTM to the DSM. Data can be obtained on request to the Walloon public service [44].The zone was also covered by recent (2012, 2015 and 2016) or old (several coverages since 1971) high-resolution orthophotos (<1 m). Finally, data from 17 gauging stations and models of the area flooded with a recurrence of 25 years were available throughout the area [45]. These models were produced by the regional administration using hydraulic models, hydrological statistics or field surveys, and cover the submerged areas approximately once every 25 years.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area and Available Data,2
113,"The first step of the methodology aimed to obtain reliable biomass estimates for trees whose crown could be delineated on a LiDAR CHM. These estimates were subsequently used to calibrate a model based on LiDAR variables (see Section 2.3).Nineteen plots were visited in 2016. Each plot was about 0.3 ha in size and located in the immediate vicinity of a river (Figure 1). While in the field, tree crowns were delineated on an orthophoto (year 2016, 25 cm in resolution) and the LiDAR CHM. Each delineated crown corresponded to the smallest unit that could be distinguished on images and linked to stems measured on the ground. A crown usually covered several stems (trees were often multi-stemmed). Species and diameter at breast height were described for all stems (DBH > 12 cm) under each crown. Stems that were not visible on aerial images were included in the crown that covered them. A total of 355 crowns were delineated, including 162 alders, 76 willows, 32 ashes, 25 maples, 18 oaks, 12 hornbeams and 32 other species.The total wood volume of trees was estimated using volume equations for each stem separately (Figure 2). Volume equations relied on species, diameter and height data. Species and diameter were described in the field. The heights of dominant stems (whose canopies were visible from above) were estimated with the maximum height of the LiDAR CHM. The heights of suppressed stems or stems with aberrant LiDAR heights were modeled with Diameter-Height relationships, computed on other riparian trees of known height. The Diameter-Height relationship was modeled for each tree species separately using a Chapman Richards curve, which is regularly used in this context [46,47]. A different procedure was used to estimate total volume for alders and willows on one hand, and other species on the other.Alders and willows were the two most frequently encountered genera. However, volume equations for these genera are rare and, in the case of alders, mostly limited to single-stemmed trees growing in forests managed for wood production. To estimate the total volume of these two genera, specific equations were developed on trees felled for the study. The total volume was measured by dividing the stem into two compartments: the trunk and big branches down to 12 cm in diameter on one hand, and the trunk and branches beyond the 12 cm crosscut on the other hand (see Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). Wood volume within the first compartment was measured in a traditional way, with successive diameter measures along the stem. To estimate the volume of the trunk and branches less than 12 cm in diameter, the wood contained in this compartment was shredded and the volume of shredded wood was measured. An expansion coefficient was estimated by shredding a batch of wood of known solid volume. The total volume was thus measured for 15 stems. The volume within the trunk and branches down to 12 cm in circumference was measured on 54 supplementary stems to ensure that the 15 stems selected for the total volume measurements were representative. The Equation (1), which is commonly used in tree allometry [51], was fitted using the method of least squares:

where Vtot is the total wood volume, D the diameter at breast height (130 cm) and H the total height. The predictive bias associated with the log transformation was corrected by the coefficient of Baskerville [52].To estimate the total wood volume of other species, we used regional forest trunk and stump volume equations [49] and the volume expansion factors of Longuetaud et al. [50] to estimate the total wood volume, which includes the volume of the stump, trunk and branches, following Equation (2):

where Vd7 is the volume of the trunk until 7 cm in diameter [49], Vstump the volume of the stump [49], and VEF the volume expansion factor [50]. We systematically used double-entry equations (diameter and height), because the use of single-entry forest equations significantly overestimates the volume of riparian trees, which have a lower height than upland forest trees.The conversion of total volume to biomass was carried out using the specific infra-density values presented in the database of Zanne et al. [48], using the equation

, where AGB is the tree aboveground biomass and wd the wood infra-density.In addition, aboveground biomass was estimated in eight additional plots about 0.3 ha each, using the same methods except that tree crowns were not delineated. These eight plots were used as complementary data for validation (see Section 2.5).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Biomass Field Data and Equations,2
114,"A tree-level allometric relationship was then adjusted between the biomass calculated in the field (in Section 2.2) and the LiDAR variables. A total of 39 trees were removed from the dataset at this stage because their crowns could not be accurately delineated. A further 23 trees were removed for other reasons, mainly because they had lost a significant part of their crown between the LiDAR and the field survey, or because they were highly distorted, and the validity of volume equations was doubtful. In the end, 293 (out of 355) trees remained. The LiDAR variables presented in Table 1 were extracted at the scale of the digitized tree crowns from the CHM and from the point cloud using the std.metrics function of the lidR R package [53].Two parametric models were adjusted using least squares regression method. Since tree biomass can differ by several orders of magnitude, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the explanatory and response variables in order to minimize the relative error on the biomass estimate rather than the absolute error. This procedure is common for tree allometry [51]. The first model m1 (Equation (3)) was based solely on variables derived from the CHM: the area of the crown digitized by the operator (Area) and the tree height (H90) on the CHM. Several combinations of variables were tested, and the best one was chosen.

The second model (m2) was based on variables from a CHM and from the LiDAR point cloud. After several attempts, the selected model takes the first model and adds a correction factor (Equation (4)). The first component of this correction factor is Pground, which corresponds to the proportion of returns classified as “ground” within the crown. This component has a high value for crowns that are porous to the LiDAR signal. The second component is the ratio of the height of the 30th percentile of the point cloud (Zq30) to the total crown height (H90) (Table 1). When returns are concentrated in the upper part of the canopy, this component has a high value. Together, these two factors help distinguish shade tolerant trees growing in dense forest (dense foliage concentrated in the upper crown area) from sun-demanding trees growing in full light (light foliage distributed over the entire crown). These ecological traits are worth considering because crown structure and wood density are very different along this gradient. The correction factor may also be influenced by other factors such as health status, social status or understory vegetation.

These tree-level allometric models were evaluated using a leave-one-out approach, where tree crowns from 18 plots were used to calibrate a model which was then validated on the digitized tree crowns of the last plot.", 2.

115,"Tree crowns were segmented using the algorithm of [41], implemented in the lidR package [53] and working only with a CHM. The segmentation parameters were adjusted by trial and error on a representative area. Segmentation accuracy was assessed on the 19 inventory plots by analyzing the overlaps between reference and segmented tree crowns. Two crowns corresponded when more than 50% of a reference crown was included in a segmented crown and the reference crown included more than 50% of the segmented crown [54]. The overall accuracy of the segmentation was calculated using the equation

116,"The allometric models m1 and m2 were validated at the scale of each inventoried plot. This validation was different from the assessment carried out at the tree level because it integrated error aggregation over several crowns and the error related to segmentation (Figure 3). A leave-one-out approach was deployed. For each of the 19 plots, we adjusted the m1 and m2 allometric models based on the trees of the other 18 plots Figure 3A). On the validation plot, the trees were automatically segmented (Figure 3B) and the model built with the trees of the 18 other plots was applied to the segments Figure 3C). Tree biomasses were aggregated at plot scale (Figure 3D). The biomass estimated by remote sensing was then compared to the total biomass of the trees measured on the plot, including those that were not selected to calibrate the allometric relationship (Figure 3E). Only segments with more than half of the area within the plot were selected. A total of 8 independent plots of about 0.3 ha in which total woody biomass was known were also used for validation (see Section 2.2). The model was thus validated on a total of 27 plots.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Validation at Plot Level,2
117,"The riparian zone was delineated as the area that is flooded every 25 years. This outer limit corresponds to that of zone 4 defined by Gurnell et al. [55] under a temperate climate. Beyond this limit, flooding no longer has a marked impact on ecosystem functioning. A map of the flooded area for a 25-year period was available for the entire study area (see Section 2.1). On rivers that are confined in narrow valleys, the flooded area does not always include vegetation patches that interact intensively with the river, without being periodically submerged [56]. Therefore, a fixed buffer of 30 m was delimited on both sides of the river banks. The riparian zone consists of the sum of the two envelopes: a variable buffer corresponding to the flooded area and a fixed buffer of 30 m on either side of the banks (Figure 4A). A dilation followed by an erosion of 30 m were applied to this envelope in order to eliminate small holes in the riparian zone, which have little meaning from an ecological point of view.In this study, riparian forests were defined as native woody plant formations within the riparian zone. Segmented tree crowns were used as a starting point to delineate riparian forests (Figure 4B). Coniferous plantations (non-native to the region) and buildings, which are sometimes segmented as trees by watershed algorithms, were filtered out using an auxiliary layer at 2 m resolution previously produced at the scale of the region [57]. Tree crowns were then used to generate a “riparian forest” envelope by applying a 10-m dilation followed by a 10-m erosion. This procedure enabled the inclusion of areas that were not covered by a tree crown in plant formations where canopy is not continuous (willow thickets for example). This “riparian forest” envelope was divided into zones of homogeneous age based on historical aerial orthophotos (Figure 4C; see also Section 2.7). It was then arbitrarily divided into vegetation units (VUs) of about 0.3 ha using the “Polygon divider” tool, implemented in QGIS (Figure 4D) [58]. This area corresponds to a compromise between the finesse of the analysis (the environmental factors must be as homogeneous as possible within a VU), representativeness and validity of biomass estimates, which were validated on plots of similar size. The surface biomass of each VU (in Mg/ha) is equal to the sum of the biomasses of segmented crowns whose centroid lies within the VU, divided by the surface area of the VU. VUs less than 1000 m2 that could not be merged with another adjacent VU of similar age were excluded from the analysis to give equal weights to VUs with similar areas.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.6. Riparian Forest Delineation and Upscaling of Biomass Prediction,2
118,"To understand what environmental factors shape the spatial distribution of biomass, different explanatory variables were computed for each VU at two different scales (Table 2). At the VU scale, environmental variables were extracted at the scale of the 0.3 ha VU polygon. At the floodplain (FP) scale, the riparian zone was cut 250 m upstream and downstream of the VU, and environmental variables were extracted and summarized at the scale of the resulting polygon. Variables can be grouped into three main thematic groups: historical, land use and geomorphological variables.Vegetation Age is presumed to be an essential variable, because many VUs in the study area result from recent colonization of agricultural areas, or have been cut down at least once during the last fifty years. Age was estimated by photo-interpretation using available orthophotos for the years 2012, 2009, 2006, 1995–1999 (several partial covers), 1983–1987 (several partial covers) and 1971. This step was performed before the final division into VUs (Figure 4c). We identified groups of contemporary trees that regenerated at the same time on historical orthophotos. The minimum size for a group of trees to be differentiated from its neighbors was 300 m2. For each group of trees, the date of vegetation regeneration was chosen as follows: when the young recruits corresponding to contemporary trees were visible on an orthophoto at a particular date, this date was retained. Otherwise, when contemporary trees appeared between two dates, the median date was chosen. As the time between two successive coverages was not constant through time, the precision was higher for young VUs (e.g., less than 3 years for trees regenerated around 2009) than for old VUs (e.g., about 14 years for trees regenerating around 1975). For trees that were already present in 1971, an age of 60 years was assigned when the trees appeared to be less than 20 years old on the 1971 orthophoto. When the vegetation seemed to already be well established, an age of 100 years was arbitrarily assigned. The trees within each VU had the same age, except for recruitment over less than 300 m2 following thinning. The type of regeneration (Planted or naturally regenerated) influences productivity in the early years, and is an important variable for managers [14]. It was therefore also described for VUs when possible, i.e., for those that regenerated after 1971.In riparian zones, many processes related to the proximity of a river can influence biomass production. Soil Waterlogging leads to anoxia, which inhibits tree growth [61]. It was characterized using a regional soil map with five classes of waterlogging corresponding to the depth at which traces of oxidation-reduction were observed [59]. A low altitudinal position may be linked to waterlogging due to the proximity of the water table or flooding, but also increases tree growth due to water availability [62,63] and sediment input during floods [18]. It was characterized by the Vertical distance variable, which corresponds to the difference between the altitude of the VU and the altitude of the river. It was calculated following the method of Alber and Piegay [64], which was implemented in the QGIS Fluvial Corridor Toolbox [65]. The Relative vertical distance corresponds to the Vertical distance divided by the 25-year flood stage. The horizontal distance to the river (Horizontal distance) differentiates between VUs close to the current river course and subject to its direct influence, and VUs located on the old channels, where the sediments are generally finer. A high Sinuosity implies that a larger area is subject to the direct influence of the watercourse [66], and characterizes the past activity and complexity of the channel [7]. The Width of the floodplain differentiates between open, humid plains and the more shaded, steeper valleys. Catchment area is a commonly used variable that characterizes the size of the river. Finally, the terrain Slope essentially differentiates the alluvial floor from the valley slopes.Land use is a proxy for the direct impacts of human activity on riparian vegetation. It also has an influence on light conditions or the supply of propagules. It was described using a regional land use layer from 2007, with three thematic classes: artificial areas, agricultural areas, forest areas [60]. The proportion of each land-use class was expressed in percentage area at the scale of the VU (Artificial in VU, Agriculture in VU, Forest in VU) and at the scale of the floodplain (Artificial in FP, Agriculture in FP, Forest in FP).Explanatory variables were standardized prior to statistical analyses. A PCA (principal component analysis) was first realized in order to explore relationships between explanatory variables. A variance partition was carried out using the vegan package [67] in order to explain the share of variance in VU biomass explained by each thematic group (history, land use and geomorphology). All variables were used at this stage. A set of variables that were poorly correlated with one another (i.e., whose absolute Pearson’s correlation coefficient with other selected variables was less than 0.5) was then constituted. A MLR (multiple linear regression) model predicting VU biomass was then adjusted with the following equation:

where Xi are explanatory variables excluding Age. The interactions of each variable with age were integrated because it was expected that the effect of the variables influencing productivity or mortality evolves with the age of vegetation. The best model was selected using a stepwise procedure based on the AIC (Akaike information criterion). The relative importance of each selected variable was computed by decomposing the explained variance into non-negative contributions, using the method of Lindeman et al. [68] implemented in the R package “relaimpo” [69].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.7. Analysis of Environmental Factors Structuring the Spatial Distribution of Biomass,2
119,"The selected model for estimating the total volume of alder and willow stems in the field is presented in Equation (6) (corresponding to the fitting of Equation (1) presented in Section 2.2). The conditions of null mean and normality of residuals, and the condition of homoscedasticity were verified respectively by a Student (p = 1), Shapiro-Wilk (p = 0.31) and Breusch Pagan test (p = 0.77). The total volume was therefore retrieved according to Equation (7), which incorporates the Baskerville correction [52].

As expected, the m2 model (1.57 log-average error, corresponding to a 57% overestimation or a 36% underestimation) was slightly but significantly better than the m1 model (1.59 log-average error, corresponding to a 59% overestimation or a 37% underestimation) (Table 3).", 3.

121,"The overall median segmentation accuracy on the reference plots was 52% (see Section 2.4 for a definition). Often several crowns were aggregated into one segment or a crown was divided into several segments, which was expected as many trees were multi-stemmed. The distribution of crowns areas was not significantly different (p = 0.82 in a Wilcoxon test) between segmented and reference (i.e., manually delineated). This close similarity justified our choice to apply calibrated allometric relationships to segments for upscaling to the whole study area.", 3. Results, 3.3. Individual Tree Segmentation,3
122,"The accuracy of biomass estimation at plot level was assessed using the 27 plots for m1 and m2 (Table 4 and Figure 5). As a reminder, plot aboveground biomass is equal to the sum of the biomass of all trees in the plot. Neither of the two models delivered a significantly biased biomass mean. Despite a clear improvement in R2 in m2, the models did not differ significantly in terms of absolute error (p-values of 0.44 and 0.27, respectively, for MAE (mean absolute error) and RMSE). Nevertheless, the m2 model appeared to be better than m1 for the set of criteria studied, and it was thus retained for the spatial analysis of biomass in relation to environmental factors.", 3. Results, 3.4. Validation at Plot Level,3
123,"A total of 3162 VUs were selected for analysis. The results of a principal component analysis on explanatory variables are shown in Figure 6. Positive values on the first axis are associated with VUs occupying a higher altitudinal position, located in narrow, forested valleys, where the vegetation is older and more biomass accumulates in vegetation (high values for Vertical distance, Relative vertical distance, Slope, Age, Forest in FP and Forest in VU). Negative values are associated with VUs occupying a lower altitudinal position, located in wide, humid and predominantly agricultural valleys (high values for Agriculture in FP, Agriculture in VU, Width and Waterlogging). The second axis distinguishes the most humid VUs located in marginal depressions, in semi-open landscapes (high values for Horizontal distance, Waterlogging, Forest in FP and Forest in VU) and on the upper left the units located in more inhabited agricultural landscapes (high values for Artificial in VU and Artificial in FP).Biomass within the VUs ranged from 3 to 515 Mg/ha (Figure 7). The average biomass for all VUs was 121 Mg/ha, and 148 Mg/ha in forested VUs (i.e., where forest land use class occupied more than 50% of the VU area). In the oldest VUs (already well established on the 1971 aerial images), the median biomass was 174 Mg/ha and 205 Mg/ha for forested VUs only. Biomass was consistently higher on valley slopes (i.e., in VUs where the relative vertical distance to the river was superior to 1) than in the floodplain (Relative vertical distance < 1).The variance partitioning carried out with all the variables explained 48% of the variance of the biomass (Figure 8). VU history (age and regeneration type) explained 34% of the variance, present land use 25% and geomorphology 26%. Nevertheless, a large part of the variance was shared between two or all three groups of variables. The variance explained exclusively by history, land use and geomorphology were 15%, 4% and 2%, respectively. VU history was thus by far the first driver of biomass accumulation in riparian forests.Vertical and horizontal distances to the river (Vertical distance and Horizontal distance), VU Age, Sinuosity, land use (Artificial in VU, Forest in VU, Agriculture in FP), type of regeneration (Planted) and Waterlogging variables presented Pearson’s correlation coefficients below 50%. They were thus integrated with their interactions with Age into a MLR (multiple linear regression) model predicting VU biomass. However, it must be kept in mind that variables that were removed at this stage will be accounted for by remaining, correlated variables. For example, Slope and Relative vertical distance were highly correlated with Vertical distance, and Width was highly correlated with Agriculture in FP and Horizontal distance.The terms of the MLR model selected by a stepwise procedure are presented in Table 5. The age and the vertical distance to the river had a strong positive effect on the biomass. The percentage of forest in the VU had a strong positive effect which was strengthened by Age. Regeneration by plantation also had a positive effect strengthened by Age. It should be noted, however, that this variable always has a value of 0 for VUs older than 40 years, and therefore it has no effect on the oldest VUs. Conversely, the percentage of agriculture in the floodplain had a strong negative effect strengthened by Age. The percentage of artificialized areas in the VU and the horizontal distance to the river also had a negative impact on biomass. Finally, Sinuosity had a marginal, negative impact on biomass.", 3. Results, 3.5. Analysis of Environmental Factors Structuring Spatial Distribution of Biomass,3
124,"The relative error on LiDAR biomass estimates (RMSEr of 22% on 0.3 ha plots for the m2 model) was in the lower range of the errors reported by Zolkos et al. [37] for temperate deciduous forests. These estimates are thus satisfactory, especially considering other uncertainties resulting from field data and allometric equations.At the individual tree level, the addition of variables from the point cloud between m1 and m2 slightly improved the model. The addition of a shape and porosity factor for the crown limited the biases linked to the light conditions and the species. For example, this correction factor was significantly different depending on the species (Figure 9), and can be considered as a proxy for the heliophilous character. In a riparian context, the heliophilous character of a tree is related to its growth rate and to the density of the wood. For example, in general, Salix spp. are heliophilous, have a fast growth rate and a low wood density. When tree biomass estimates were aggregated at plot level, the added value of the variables derived from point cloud was no longer significant. However, m2 outperformed m1 in terms of R2, MAE and RMSE, and the non-significance of differences could simply be due to the small number of plots considered. Our results are thus more nuanced than those of Garcia et al. [70] and Chirici et al. [71], who found no significant difference between biomass models based on CHM or point cloud. Despite a lower performance, there are several advantages to using a model based solely on tree height and crown area. First, the use of a CHM is straightforward and does not need high computational power. The influence of survey parameters (e.g., point density, flight altitude or scan angle) or ground conditions (e.g., phenology) on CHM properties or height estimates has been well studied [53,72,73,74]. Therefore, when working simultaneously with several CHMs (e.g., multi-temporal or compiled from several locations), these effects can be accounted for or assumed to be negligible [75]. In contrast, when using point clouds, it may be more difficult to do so with variables related to lower height percentiles, canopy closure or LAI (leaf area index) [76]. A third advantage of CHMs beyond ease of use and robustness is that it can be updated with photogrammetric point clouds once a first LiDAR survey has been done [77]. The m1 model could thus be better suited to the use of time series or to the comparison of sites covered by different datasets.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. LiDAR Biomass Estimates,4
125,"Age was by far the most structuring variable for biomass. Moreover, as in the study of Dybala et al. [22], planting increases production in the early years compared to natural regeneration. This higher productivity of plantations was at least partially due to the choice of fast-growing species such as poplar for plantations. The median values obtained for standing biomass within forested VUs (205 Mg/ha for VUs older than 60 years, 122 Mg/ha for VUs aged 40–60 years) were within the range of values reported by for a temperate climate [5,78]. The median value obtained here for all age classes combined for forest units was 121 Mg/ha. Some authors reported very high values for all age classes, such as 284 Mg/ha for alder forests [25], or 199 Mg/ha for poplar forests and 281 Mg/ha for hardwood forests [79]. Nevertheless, these studies were carried out in smaller or protected areas, whereas the present study includes actively managed and heavily disturbed areas. Finally, the values obtained within forest units were lower than the values of aboveground woody biomass stored within forests in general in Wallonia, which are about 200 Mg/ha for deciduous forests [80]. Our lower values may be related to the lower age of the forests within the floodplain than in upland areas.Apart from age, land use variables had a significant impact on biomass distribution. The results of variance partitioning and especially those of the MLR tended to show that the effect of land use was more important than the effect of geomorphology. In agricultural or urban areas, some VUs are regularly thinned or pruned, which can limit the accumulation of biomass. Moreover, vegetation that develops spontaneously on abandoned agricultural plots does not regenerate as quickly as in forests: the recruitment of large trees can be blocked by pioneer shrubs and is not promoted by silvicultural practices. As a result, woody recruitment is often spatially uneven or even scattered. Wasser et al. [23] also found a lower tree height in riparian corridors located in agricultural landscapes than in forested landscapes, related to higher disturbance (e.g., wind throw, mowing or plowing) and different species composition. Our results highlight the greater importance of human factors (land use and associated management practices, as well as vegetation age, which is related to human disturbance) over those of natural origin (geomorphology) in the study area. This stresses the relevance of taking into account the socio-cultural dimension of riparian ecosystems, as suggested by Dufour et al. [81].Vegetation units in the lower parts of the riparian zone (i.e., lower vertical distance to the river) had a lower biomass at the same age than those occupying a higher topographical position. Two factors may explain this distribution. First, VUs located in lower parts of the floodplains are more heterogeneous and are subject to a more intense disturbance regime. These disturbances include flooding, erosion, and the action of beavers, which are well established throughout the area of interest. Trees in the more humid parts of the plain may also be more exposed to diseases such as Phytophtora alni [82] or Hymenoscyphus fraxineus [83]. Tree falls may also be promoted by waterlogging [84]. Apart from disturbance, waterlogging in the lower parts of the plain would have a greater impact on productivity than nutrients provided by sediment. In other studies, the balance between these two environmental variables was sometimes a dominance of the negative effect of waterlogging on productivity [16,85,86], and sometimes a dominant positive effect of nutrients or water availability [18,87]. In particular, Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al. [17] found lower radial wood growth in the wettest areas for Alnus glutinosa and Salix atrocinerea forests in the Iberian Peninsula, which are quite similar to those considered in our study. In our study, a combination of both factors—waterlogging stress and a more intense disturbance regime—explains the lower biomass found in the lower parts of the floodplain.Finally, VUs located far from the main channel (i.e., higher horizontal distance to the river) had a lower biomass. This effect was most noticeable beyond the first fifty meters from the channel. In the study area, VUs far from the river were actually located in wide sections of the floodplain, in marginal depressions or in old channels disconnected from the river bed. These areas are enriched with fine sediments and are poorly drained. They are often occupied by shrubs such as Salix aurita, which have a low biomass.The factors structuring riparian biomass distribution are not yet well known in most regions of the world [7]. The proposed approach could be replicated in other regions in order to compare biomass distribution patterns. For example, with a drier climate, water availability may be more limiting [88]. The response of biomass to the vertical distance to the river, which was monotonous in our study, could in these cases present a peak at intermediate altitudes as proposed by Odum [89]. It would also be possible to compare areas receiving more or less rich sediments [90], to study the distribution of biomass in other geomorphological contexts, such as in braided rivers where mortality due to erosion may be higher [91], in larger catchment areas (by going further upstream or downstream), or in less anthropized areas.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Spatial Distribution of Biomass and Influencing Factors,4
126,"Our method essentially exploits LiDAR data, which are increasingly available at regional scales [22]. Most of the auxiliary data used are available in many countries (land use, river network) or can be derived from a LiDAR dataset (vertical distance to the river, slope, floodplain boundaries). Most countries do not have soil maps as precise as those available in Belgium, where the map is based on about two survey plots per hectare. However, soil variables seemed to be accounted for by topographical variables, and were not kept in the final MLR model. The age and type of regeneration can nevertheless be costly or tedious to obtain, as they rely on photo-interpretation of historical orthophotos, whose accessibility is uneven from one country to another.An advantage of the individual trees approach used in this study is its flexibility regarding spatial scale. For the needs of the study, segmented trees were grouped in 0.3 ha vegetation units. However, trees can easily be re-aggregated differently depending on pursued objectives. For example, one could study biomass in the immediate vicinity of the river (e.g., first 30 m from the water edge, where bio-geomorphic interactions are most intense) using the same delineated crowns and associated biomass estimates.We estimated only one compartment of the carbon stored by riparian ecosystems: the aboveground woody biomass. This is justified because it is the most variable compartment at a fine spatial scale and the most dynamic on time scales of a few decades [34,79]. Storage within the other compartments (especially in roots, soil and dead wood) is more difficult to measure, but it can have a significant magnitude and spatial variation, as shown by Wohl et al. [20]. These compartments are difficult to study by remote sensing, but could be modeled using topographic or geomorphological data, as in Suchenwirth et al. [34].", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Perspectives for Generalization of the Approach,4
127,"Our individual-tree, LiDAR-based approach enabled us to map aboveground biomass over 200 km of rivers with an error of 22% at the scale of 0.3 ha units. The addition of variables derived from the point cloud did not significantly improve CHM-based biomass estimates. For practitioners, the marginal improvement when working with point clouds must be balanced with the advantages of working with CHMs: robustness to varying survey conditions, ease of use, low computational requirements and possible update with photogrammetric point clouds.The biomass map was used to better understand the patterns of biomass distribution within the riparian zone. In the study area, vegetation age was the most important variable. Present land use was second, followed by geomorphological variables. Over the study area, anthropogenic factors (land use and vegetation age, which are related to human practices) were more important than geomorphic factors concerning biomass accumulation within vegetation.Surface biomass was higher inside forest, in higher topographical parts of the riparian zone and close to the river rather than in remnant patches in the agricultural landscape, and in low-lying areas further away from the river. The implementation of similar approaches in other catchments will be eased by the growing availability of LiDAR data at regional scales. Ultimately, remote sensing approaches could help understand how spatial biomass distribution patterns vary depending on the ecological context, and inform land use, conservation or restoration policies in riparian zones.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
128,"Riparian ecosystems are ecotones where rivers and upland areas influence one another. They host specific plant communities related to water proximity and availability, soil anoxia or flood disturbance. They are home to an exceptional biodiversity [1], and riparian vegetation produces numerous ecosystem services concerning water quality, flow regulation or erosion mitigation [2]. However, they are subject to multiple pressures and have been degraded in many regions of the world [3]. Consequently, there has been a particular interest for several decades in the conservation or restoration of these ecosystems [4].Dybala et al. [5] and Matzek et al. [6] pointed out that carbon storage for climate change mitigation could be a co-benefit of conservation or restoration policies that promote biodiversity. Indeed, vegetation biomass, which is one of the largest compartments for carbon storage in riparian ecosystems [7], is related to other key biophysical functions of riparian ecosystems. For example, vegetation biomass drives the production of large woody debris, which is a key process influencing habitat complexity, hydraulic and sedimentary processes [8,9]. Vegetation biomass also has tremendous effects on nutrient cycling in the ecosystem [10,11]. More generally, biomass is a component of forest structure, which itself influences sediment stabilization [12], hydraulic roughness [13] or habitat provisioning [14].The amount of biomass in riparian vegetation depends primarily on productivity, vegetation type (e.g., tree longevity or wood density) and disturbance regime. Productivity of riparian vegetation is notably influenced by the interplay between water availability [15], soil anoxia occurring as a result of flooding or proximity to the water table [16,17] or nutrient-rich sediment brought in during floods [18]. Disturbances related to flooding and erosion [19], beavers [20], livestock [21], or anthropogenic disturbances related to agriculture and forestry [22,23,24] notably reduce vegetation biomass. The aforementioned factors also influence the type of vegetation that establishes in one place, which in turn determines potential biomass storage, for example through tree longevity [18]. However, knowledge is lacking on how these factors interact to shape vegetation biomass distribution, and few studies have been carried out in Europe [2,7,14]. Moreover, there is a lack of allometric equations for estimating tree biomass in riparian forests [25].Remote sensing is widely used for estimating biomass over wide areas in a spatially continuous manner [26,27]. However, most studies in the riparian context have been limited to reaches a few kilometers long [28], and used spectral data in classification-based approaches [25,29,30]. Such approaches do not take into account the great spatial variability and continuum between different vegetation types in riparian systems. LiDAR (light detection and ranging) data have several advantages over spectral data for biomass estimation. They are less subject to saturation [31,32,33,34], and are suitable for direct biomass modeling [35]. LiDAR data can be used to build digital terrain models (DTMs), which allow the heterogeneous topography of the riparian zone under the canopy to be observed, unlike spectral data. They are increasingly available, and have a strong potential for upscaling biomass estimates over hundreds to thousands kilometers of rivers [28]. LiDAR data are often used as point clouds, where each point corresponds to a LiDAR return. This method requires some skills and is computationally intensive, but it enables studying the internal structure of the canopy [36]. For simplicity, LiDAR data are often preprocessed as a raster format CHM (Canopy Height Model), where each pixel represents the height of the canopy top. LiDAR data have proven to be effective for estimating biomass in different forest types [37] and in a riparian context [38]. As compared to other forests, riparian forests have an original structure with multi-stemmed trees and shrubs [39], high species diversity [40], and a complex landscape organization with many linear patches. In this context, the high 2D and 3D resolution of LiDAR is a definite advantage, and biomass is preferably estimated using object-based approaches (with objects corresponding to trees or groups of trees), which are expected to improve performance and simplify field sampling in fragmented landscapes [41].Although promising, to our knowledge, object-oriented approaches based on LiDAR data have not been used to estimate biomass in riparian forests. Moreover, remote sensing has not been used to improve understanding of spatial distribution of biomass patterns in riparian ecosystems according to geomorphic and anthropogenic factors (related studies include [29,42], who used satellite data to map vegetation greenness in relation to geomorphic factors). The objectives of this article were as follows:To propose an approach to estimate aboveground biomass at tree level, and to compare two biomass estimates based on variables from a raster-format LiDAR CHM or from the original LiDAR point cloud;To highlight environmental factors structuring biomass distribution in riparian forests at a sub-regional scale (200 km of river and their riparian zone) in the context of low-energy temperate rivers (Meuse catchment, Western Europe).", 1. Introduction,None,1.
129,"The study area is located in Wallonia (southern Belgium), within the Meuse catchment area (Figure 1). It is a publicly managed area, comprising about 200 km of rivers mapped from the point where their catchment area reaches 50 km2. The studied rivers drain an area of about 1200 km2. Public management in the study area is limited to the bankfull channel of rivers, as well as vegetation or other structures in the channel. It encompasses all actions needed in the channel to promote its hydraulic, ecological and social functions such as logjam removal, bank reinforcement, riparian planting, etc. The study area can be divided into two main sub-basins. In the northern part of the study area, the Semois and its tributaries have a gravel bed, a gentle slope and frequently overflow in winter. Downstream, the Semois produces broad, steeply sloping meanders [43]. In the southern part, the Ton and its tributaries have sandy beds, flow into clayey plains and have a hydrological regime dominated by base flow. On the whole, these rivers have little activity and flow in a landscape of forests and meadows, where riparian forests are often reduced to a row of trees along the river. The most frequent tree species are alders (Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertner) and willows (including Salix alba x fragilis L., S. viminalis L., S. caprea L. and S. aurita L.), which are often multi-stemmed. Maple (Acer pseudoplatanus L.), ash (Fraxinus excelsior L.), oak (Quercus robur L.) and hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.) are also common. Finally, even-aged spruce plantations (Picea abies (L.) Karst) can be found in the valley bottoms.The area was covered during the winter of 2014 by an aerial LiDAR survey. The survey was ordered by the Walloon administration over the entire Wallonia. The initial aim was to produce a DTM (Digital Terrain Model) that could then be used for multiple purposes. The acquisition was performed with a Riegl Litemapper 6800i, with a pulse repetition rate of 150 kHz and a maximum scan angle of 60°. The flight altitude ranged from 1200 to 1500 m AGL and the flight speed was 75 m/s. Average point density was 0.8 to 1 ground return/m2. Point positions were corrected during post-processing using ground references, and the mean absolute error in planimetry was 0.12 m. The point cloud was classified using full wave and morphological analysis. One-meter-resolution DTM and DSM (digital surface model) were created using a Natural Neighbor interpolation, using points classified as “ground” and points with maximum altitude, respectively. Data were provided as a point cloud with a non-normalized intensity and as 1-m-resolution DTM and DSM. A CHM was created by subtracting the DTM to the DSM. Data can be obtained on request to the Walloon public service [44].The zone was also covered by recent (2012, 2015 and 2016) or old (several coverages since 1971) high-resolution orthophotos (<1 m). Finally, data from 17 gauging stations and models of the area flooded with a recurrence of 25 years were available throughout the area [45]. These models were produced by the regional administration using hydraulic models, hydrological statistics or field surveys, and cover the submerged areas approximately once every 25 years.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area and Available Data,2
130,"The first step of the methodology aimed to obtain reliable biomass estimates for trees whose crown could be delineated on a LiDAR CHM. These estimates were subsequently used to calibrate a model based on LiDAR variables (see Section 2.3).Nineteen plots were visited in 2016. Each plot was about 0.3 ha in size and located in the immediate vicinity of a river (Figure 1). While in the field, tree crowns were delineated on an orthophoto (year 2016, 25 cm in resolution) and the LiDAR CHM. Each delineated crown corresponded to the smallest unit that could be distinguished on images and linked to stems measured on the ground. A crown usually covered several stems (trees were often multi-stemmed). Species and diameter at breast height were described for all stems (DBH > 12 cm) under each crown. Stems that were not visible on aerial images were included in the crown that covered them. A total of 355 crowns were delineated, including 162 alders, 76 willows, 32 ashes, 25 maples, 18 oaks, 12 hornbeams and 32 other species.The total wood volume of trees was estimated using volume equations for each stem separately (Figure 2). Volume equations relied on species, diameter and height data. Species and diameter were described in the field. The heights of dominant stems (whose canopies were visible from above) were estimated with the maximum height of the LiDAR CHM. The heights of suppressed stems or stems with aberrant LiDAR heights were modeled with Diameter-Height relationships, computed on other riparian trees of known height. The Diameter-Height relationship was modeled for each tree species separately using a Chapman Richards curve, which is regularly used in this context [46,47]. A different procedure was used to estimate total volume for alders and willows on one hand, and other species on the other.Alders and willows were the two most frequently encountered genera. However, volume equations for these genera are rare and, in the case of alders, mostly limited to single-stemmed trees growing in forests managed for wood production. To estimate the total volume of these two genera, specific equations were developed on trees felled for the study. The total volume was measured by dividing the stem into two compartments: the trunk and big branches down to 12 cm in diameter on one hand, and the trunk and branches beyond the 12 cm crosscut on the other hand (see Figure S1 in Supplementary Material). Wood volume within the first compartment was measured in a traditional way, with successive diameter measures along the stem. To estimate the volume of the trunk and branches less than 12 cm in diameter, the wood contained in this compartment was shredded and the volume of shredded wood was measured. An expansion coefficient was estimated by shredding a batch of wood of known solid volume. The total volume was thus measured for 15 stems. The volume within the trunk and branches down to 12 cm in circumference was measured on 54 supplementary stems to ensure that the 15 stems selected for the total volume measurements were representative. The Equation (1), which is commonly used in tree allometry [51], was fitted using the method of least squares:

where Vtot is the total wood volume, D the diameter at breast height (130 cm) and H the total height. The predictive bias associated with the log transformation was corrected by the coefficient of Baskerville [52].To estimate the total wood volume of other species, we used regional forest trunk and stump volume equations [49] and the volume expansion factors of Longuetaud et al. [50] to estimate the total wood volume, which includes the volume of the stump, trunk and branches, following Equation (2):

where Vd7 is the volume of the trunk until 7 cm in diameter [49], Vstump the volume of the stump [49], and VEF the volume expansion factor [50]. We systematically used double-entry equations (diameter and height), because the use of single-entry forest equations significantly overestimates the volume of riparian trees, which have a lower height than upland forest trees.The conversion of total volume to biomass was carried out using the specific infra-density values presented in the database of Zanne et al. [48], using the equation

, where AGB is the tree aboveground biomass and wd the wood infra-density.In addition, aboveground biomass was estimated in eight additional plots about 0.3 ha each, using the same methods except that tree crowns were not delineated. These eight plots were used as complementary data for validation (see Section 2.5).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Biomass Field Data and Equations,2
131,"A tree-level allometric relationship was then adjusted between the biomass calculated in the field (in Section 2.2) and the LiDAR variables. A total of 39 trees were removed from the dataset at this stage because their crowns could not be accurately delineated. A further 23 trees were removed for other reasons, mainly because they had lost a significant part of their crown between the LiDAR and the field survey, or because they were highly distorted, and the validity of volume equations was doubtful. In the end, 293 (out of 355) trees remained. The LiDAR variables presented in Table 1 were extracted at the scale of the digitized tree crowns from the CHM and from the point cloud using the std.metrics function of the lidR R package [53].Two parametric models were adjusted using least squares regression method. Since tree biomass can differ by several orders of magnitude, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the explanatory and response variables in order to minimize the relative error on the biomass estimate rather than the absolute error. This procedure is common for tree allometry [51]. The first model m1 (Equation (3)) was based solely on variables derived from the CHM: the area of the crown digitized by the operator (Area) and the tree height (H90) on the CHM. Several combinations of variables were tested, and the best one was chosen.

The second model (m2) was based on variables from a CHM and from the LiDAR point cloud. After several attempts, the selected model takes the first model and adds a correction factor (Equation (4)). The first component of this correction factor is Pground, which corresponds to the proportion of returns classified as “ground” within the crown. This component has a high value for crowns that are porous to the LiDAR signal. The second component is the ratio of the height of the 30th percentile of the point cloud (Zq30) to the total crown height (H90) (Table 1). When returns are concentrated in the upper part of the canopy, this component has a high value. Together, these two factors help distinguish shade tolerant trees growing in dense forest (dense foliage concentrated in the upper crown area) from sun-demanding trees growing in full light (light foliage distributed over the entire crown). These ecological traits are worth considering because crown structure and wood density are very different along this gradient. The correction factor may also be influenced by other factors such as health status, social status or understory vegetation.

These tree-level allometric models were evaluated using a leave-one-out approach, where tree crowns from 18 plots were used to calibrate a model which was then validated on the digitized tree crowns of the last plot.", 2.

132,"Tree crowns were segmented using the algorithm of [41], implemented in the lidR package [53] and working only with a CHM. The segmentation parameters were adjusted by trial and error on a representative area. Segmentation accuracy was assessed on the 19 inventory plots by analyzing the overlaps between reference and segmented tree crowns. Two crowns corresponded when more than 50% of a reference crown was included in a segmented crown and the reference crown included more than 50% of the segmented crown [54].

133,"The allometric models m1 and m2 were validated at the scale of each inventoried plot. This validation was different from the assessment carried out at the tree level because it integrated error aggregation over several crowns and the error related to segmentation (Figure 3). A leave-one-out approach was deployed. For each of the 19 plots, we adjusted the m1 and m2 allometric models based on the trees of the other 18 plots Figure 3A). On the validation plot, the trees were automatically segmented (Figure 3B) and the model built with the trees of the 18 other plots was applied to the segments Figure 3C). Tree biomasses were aggregated at plot scale (Figure 3D). The biomass estimated by remote sensing was then compared to the total biomass of the trees measured on the plot, including those that were not selected to calibrate the allometric relationship (Figure 3E). Only segments with more than half of the area within the plot were selected. A total of 8 independent plots of about 0.3 ha in which total woody biomass was known were also used for validation (see Section 2.2). The model was thus validated on a total of 27 plots.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Validation at Plot Level,2
134,"The riparian zone was delineated as the area that is flooded every 25 years. This outer limit corresponds to that of zone 4 defined by Gurnell et al. [55] under a temperate climate. Beyond this limit, flooding no longer has a marked impact on ecosystem functioning. A map of the flooded area for a 25-year period was available for the entire study area (see Section 2.1). On rivers that are confined in narrow valleys, the flooded area does not always include vegetation patches that interact intensively with the river, without being periodically submerged [56]. Therefore, a fixed buffer of 30 m was delimited on both sides of the river banks. The riparian zone consists of the sum of the two envelopes: a variable buffer corresponding to the flooded area and a fixed buffer of 30 m on either side of the banks (Figure 4A). A dilation followed by an erosion of 30 m were applied to this envelope in order to eliminate small holes in the riparian zone, which have little meaning from an ecological point of view.In this study, riparian forests were defined as native woody plant formations within the riparian zone. Segmented tree crowns were used as a starting point to delineate riparian forests (Figure 4B). Coniferous plantations (non-native to the region) and buildings, which are sometimes segmented as trees by watershed algorithms, were filtered out using an auxiliary layer at 2 m resolution previously produced at the scale of the region [57]. Tree crowns were then used to generate a “riparian forest” envelope by applying a 10-m dilation followed by a 10-m erosion. This procedure enabled the inclusion of areas that were not covered by a tree crown in plant formations where canopy is not continuous (willow thickets for example). This “riparian forest” envelope was divided into zones of homogeneous age based on historical aerial orthophotos (Figure 4C; see also Section 2.7). It was then arbitrarily divided into vegetation units (VUs) of about 0.3 ha using the “Polygon divider” tool, implemented in QGIS (Figure 4D) [58]. This area corresponds to a compromise between the finesse of the analysis (the environmental factors must be as homogeneous as possible within a VU), representativeness and validity of biomass estimates, which were validated on plots of similar size. The surface biomass of each VU (in Mg/ha) is equal to the sum of the biomasses of segmented crowns whose centroid lies within the VU, divided by the surface area of the VU. VUs less than 1000 m2 that could not be merged with another adjacent VU of similar age were excluded from the analysis to give equal weights to VUs with similar areas.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.6. Riparian Forest Delineation and Upscaling of Biomass Prediction,2
135,"To understand what environmental factors shape the spatial distribution of biomass, different explanatory variables were computed for each VU at two different scales (Table 2). At the VU scale, environmental variables were extracted at the scale of the 0.3 ha VU polygon. At the floodplain (FP) scale, the riparian zone was cut 250 m upstream and downstream of the VU, and environmental variables were extracted and summarized at the scale of the resulting polygon. Variables can be grouped into three main thematic groups: historical, land use and geomorphological variables.Vegetation Age is presumed to be an essential variable, because many VUs in the study area result from recent colonization of agricultural areas, or have been cut down at least once during the last fifty years. Age was estimated by photo-interpretation using available orthophotos for the years 2012, 2009, 2006, 1995–1999 (several partial covers), 1983–1987 (several partial covers) and 1971. This step was performed before the final division into VUs (Figure 4c). We identified groups of contemporary trees that regenerated at the same time on historical orthophotos. The minimum size for a group of trees to be differentiated from its neighbors was 300 m2. For each group of trees, the date of vegetation regeneration was chosen as follows: when the young recruits corresponding to contemporary trees were visible on an orthophoto at a particular date, this date was retained. Otherwise, when contemporary trees appeared between two dates, the median date was chosen. As the time between two successive coverages was not constant through time, the precision was higher for young VUs (e.g., less than 3 years for trees regenerated around 2009) than for old VUs (e.g., about 14 years for trees regenerating around 1975). For trees that were already present in 1971, an age of 60 years was assigned when the trees appeared to be less than 20 years old on the 1971 orthophoto. When the vegetation seemed to already be well established, an age of 100 years was arbitrarily assigned. The trees within each VU had the same age, except for recruitment over less than 300 m2 following thinning. The type of regeneration (Planted or naturally regenerated) influences productivity in the early years, and is an important variable for managers [14]. It was therefore also described for VUs when possible, i.e., for those that regenerated after 1971.In riparian zones, many processes related to the proximity of a river can influence biomass production. Soil Waterlogging leads to anoxia, which inhibits tree growth [61]. It was characterized using a regional soil map with five classes of waterlogging corresponding to the depth at which traces of oxidation-reduction were observed [59]. A low altitudinal position may be linked to waterlogging due to the proximity of the water table or flooding, but also increases tree growth due to water availability [62,63] and sediment input during floods [18]. It was characterized by the Vertical distance variable, which corresponds to the difference between the altitude of the VU and the altitude of the river. It was calculated following the method of Alber and Piegay [64], which was implemented in the QGIS Fluvial Corridor Toolbox [65]. The Relative vertical distance corresponds to the Vertical distance divided by the 25-year flood stage. The horizontal distance to the river (Horizontal distance) differentiates between VUs close to the current river course and subject to its direct influence, and VUs located on the old channels, where the sediments are generally finer. A high Sinuosity implies that a larger area is subject to the direct influence of the watercourse [66], and characterizes the past activity and complexity of the channel [7]. The Width of the floodplain differentiates between open, humid plains and the more shaded, steeper valleys. Catchment area is a commonly used variable that characterizes the size of the river. Finally, the terrain Slope essentially differentiates the alluvial floor from the valley slopes.Land use is a proxy for the direct impacts of human activity on riparian vegetation. It also has an influence on light conditions or the supply of propagules. It was described using a regional land use layer from 2007, with three thematic classes: artificial areas, agricultural areas, forest areas [60]. The proportion of each land-use class was expressed in percentage area at the scale of the VU (Artificial in VU, Agriculture in VU, Forest in VU) and at the scale of the floodplain (Artificial in FP, Agriculture in FP, Forest in FP).Explanatory variables were standardized prior to statistical analyses. A PCA (principal component analysis) was first realized in order to explore relationships between explanatory variables. A variance partition was carried out using the vegan package [67] in order to explain the share of variance in VU biomass explained by each thematic group (history, land use and geomorphology). All variables were used at this stage. A set of variables that were poorly correlated with one another (i.e., whose absolute Pearson’s correlation coefficient with other selected variables was less than 0.5) was then constituted. A MLR (multiple linear regression) model predicting VU biomass was then adjusted with the following equation:

where Xi are explanatory variables excluding Age. The interactions of each variable with age were integrated because it was expected that the effect of the variables influencing productivity or mortality evolves with the age of vegetation. The best model was selected using a stepwise procedure based on the AIC (Akaike information criterion). The relative importance of each selected variable was computed by decomposing the explained variance into non-negative contributions, using the method of Lindeman et al. [68] implemented in the R package “relaimpo” [69].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.7. Analysis of Environmental Factors Structuring the Spatial Distribution of Biomass,2

As expected, the m2 model (1.57 log-average error, corresponding to a 57% overestimation or a 36% underestimation) was slightly but significantly better than the m1 model (1.59 log-average error, corresponding to a 59% overestimation or a 37% underestimation) (Table 3).", 3.

138,"The overall median segmentation accuracy on the reference plots was 52% (see Section 2.4 for a definition). Often several crowns were aggregated into one segment or a crown was divided into several segments, which was expected as many trees were multi-stemmed. The distribution of crowns areas was not significantly different (p = 0.82 in a Wilcoxon test) between segmented and reference (i.e., manually delineated). This close similarity justified our choice to apply calibrated allometric relationships to segments for upscaling to the whole study area.", 3. Results, 3.3. Individual Tree Segmentation,3
139,"The accuracy of biomass estimation at plot level was assessed using the 27 plots for m1 and m2 (Table 4 and Figure 5). As a reminder, plot aboveground biomass is equal to the sum of the biomass of all trees in the plot. Neither of the two models delivered a significantly biased biomass mean. Despite a clear improvement in R2 in m2, the models did not differ significantly in terms of absolute error (p-values of 0.44 and 0.27, respectively, for MAE (mean absolute error) and RMSE). Nevertheless, the m2 model appeared to be better than m1 for the set of criteria studied, and it was thus retained for the spatial analysis of biomass in relation to environmental factors.", 3. Results, 3.4. Validation at Plot Level,3
140,"A total of 3162 VUs were selected for analysis. The results of a principal component analysis on explanatory variables are shown in Figure 6. Positive values on the first axis are associated with VUs occupying a higher altitudinal position, located in narrow, forested valleys, where the vegetation is older and more biomass accumulates in vegetation (high values for Vertical distance, Relative vertical distance, Slope, Age, Forest in FP and Forest in VU). Negative values are associated with VUs occupying a lower altitudinal position, located in wide, humid and predominantly agricultural valleys (high values for Agriculture in FP, Agriculture in VU, Width and Waterlogging). The second axis distinguishes the most humid VUs located in marginal depressions, in semi-open landscapes (high values for Horizontal distance, Waterlogging, Forest in FP and Forest in VU) and on the upper left the units located in more inhabited agricultural landscapes (high values for Artificial in VU and Artificial in FP).Biomass within the VUs ranged from 3 to 515 Mg/ha (Figure 7). The average biomass for all VUs was 121 Mg/ha, and 148 Mg/ha in forested VUs (i.e., where forest land use class occupied more than 50% of the VU area). In the oldest VUs (already well established on the 1971 aerial images), the median biomass was 174 Mg/ha and 205 Mg/ha for forested VUs only. Biomass was consistently higher on valley slopes (i.e., in VUs where the relative vertical distance to the river was superior to 1) than in the floodplain (Relative vertical distance < 1).The variance partitioning carried out with all the variables explained 48% of the variance of the biomass (Figure 8). VU history (age and regeneration type) explained 34% of the variance, present land use 25% and geomorphology 26%. Nevertheless, a large part of the variance was shared between two or all three groups of variables. The variance explained exclusively by history, land use and geomorphology were 15%, 4% and 2%, respectively. VU history was thus by far the first driver of biomass accumulation in riparian forests.Vertical and horizontal distances to the river (Vertical distance and Horizontal distance), VU Age, Sinuosity, land use (Artificial in VU, Forest in VU, Agriculture in FP), type of regeneration (Planted) and Waterlogging variables presented Pearson’s correlation coefficients below 50%. They were thus integrated with their interactions with Age into a MLR (multiple linear regression) model predicting VU biomass. However, it must be kept in mind that variables that were removed at this stage will be accounted for by remaining, correlated variables. For example, Slope and Relative vertical distance were highly correlated with Vertical distance, and Width was highly correlated with Agriculture in FP and Horizontal distance.The terms of the MLR model selected by a stepwise procedure are presented in Table 5. The age and the vertical distance to the river had a strong positive effect on the biomass. The percentage of forest in the VU had a strong positive effect which was strengthened by Age. Regeneration by plantation also had a positive effect strengthened by Age. It should be noted, however, that this variable always has a value of 0 for VUs older than 40 years, and therefore it has no effect on the oldest VUs. Conversely, the percentage of agriculture in the floodplain had a strong negative effect strengthened by Age. The percentage of artificialized areas in the VU and the horizontal distance to the river also had a negative impact on biomass. Finally, Sinuosity had a marginal, negative impact on biomass.", 3. Results, 3.5. Analysis of Environmental Factors Structuring Spatial Distribution of Biomass,3
141,"The relative error on LiDAR biomass estimates (RMSEr of 22% on 0.3 ha plots for the m2 model) was in the lower range of the errors reported by Zolkos et al. [37] for temperate deciduous forests. These estimates are thus satisfactory, especially considering other uncertainties resulting from field data and allometric equations.At the individual tree level, the addition of variables from the point cloud between m1 and m2 slightly improved the model. The addition of a shape and porosity factor for the crown limited the biases linked to the light conditions and the species. For example, this correction factor was significantly different depending on the species (Figure 9), and can be considered as a proxy for the heliophilous character. In a riparian context, the heliophilous character of a tree is related to its growth rate and to the density of the wood. For example, in general, Salix spp. are heliophilous, have a fast growth rate and a low wood density. When tree biomass estimates were aggregated at plot level, the added value of the variables derived from point cloud was no longer significant. However, m2 outperformed m1 in terms of R2, MAE and RMSE, and the non-significance of differences could simply be due to the small number of plots considered. Our results are thus more nuanced than those of Garcia et al. [70] and Chirici et al. [71], who found no significant difference between biomass models based on CHM or point cloud. Despite a lower performance, there are several advantages to using a model based solely on tree height and crown area. First, the use of a CHM is straightforward and does not need high computational power. The influence of survey parameters (e.g., point density, flight altitude or scan angle) or ground conditions (e.g., phenology) on CHM properties or height estimates has been well studied [53,72,73,74]. Therefore, when working simultaneously with several CHMs (e.g., multi-temporal or compiled from several locations), these effects can be accounted for or assumed to be negligible [75]. In contrast, when using point clouds, it may be more difficult to do so with variables related to lower height percentiles, canopy closure or LAI (leaf area index) [76]. A third advantage of CHMs beyond ease of use and robustness is that it can be updated with photogrammetric point clouds once a first LiDAR survey has been done [77]. The m1 model could thus be better suited to the use of time series or to the comparison of sites covered by different datasets.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. LiDAR Biomass Estimates,4
142,"Age was by far the most structuring variable for biomass. Moreover, as in the study of Dybala et al. [22], planting increases production in the early years compared to natural regeneration. This higher productivity of plantations was at least partially due to the choice of fast-growing species such as poplar for plantations. The median values obtained for standing biomass within forested VUs (205 Mg/ha for VUs older than 60 years, 122 Mg/ha for VUs aged 40–60 years) were within the range of values reported by for a temperate climate [5,78]. The median value obtained here for all age classes combined for forest units was 121 Mg/ha. Some authors reported very high values for all age classes, such as 284 Mg/ha for alder forests [25], or 199 Mg/ha for poplar forests and 281 Mg/ha for hardwood forests [79]. Nevertheless, these studies were carried out in smaller or protected areas, whereas the present study includes actively managed and heavily disturbed areas. Finally, the values obtained within forest units were lower than the values of aboveground woody biomass stored within forests in general in Wallonia, which are about 200 Mg/ha for deciduous forests [80]. Our lower values may be related to the lower age of the forests within the floodplain than in upland areas.Apart from age, land use variables had a significant impact on biomass distribution. The results of variance partitioning and especially those of the MLR tended to show that the effect of land use was more important than the effect of geomorphology. In agricultural or urban areas, some VUs are regularly thinned or pruned, which can limit the accumulation of biomass. Moreover, vegetation that develops spontaneously on abandoned agricultural plots does not regenerate as quickly as in forests: the recruitment of large trees can be blocked by pioneer shrubs and is not promoted by silvicultural practices. As a result, woody recruitment is often spatially uneven or even scattered. Wasser et al. [23] also found a lower tree height in riparian corridors located in agricultural landscapes than in forested landscapes, related to higher disturbance (e.g., wind throw, mowing or plowing) and different species composition. Our results highlight the greater importance of human factors (land use and associated management practices, as well as vegetation age, which is related to human disturbance) over those of natural origin (geomorphology) in the study area. This stresses the relevance of taking into account the socio-cultural dimension of riparian ecosystems, as suggested by Dufour et al. [81].Vegetation units in the lower parts of the riparian zone (i.e., lower vertical distance to the river) had a lower biomass at the same age than those occupying a higher topographical position. Two factors may explain this distribution. First, VUs located in lower parts of the floodplains are more heterogeneous and are subject to a more intense disturbance regime. These disturbances include flooding, erosion, and the action of beavers, which are well established throughout the area of interest. Trees in the more humid parts of the plain may also be more exposed to diseases such as Phytophtora alni [82] or Hymenoscyphus fraxineus [83]. Tree falls may also be promoted by waterlogging [84]. Apart from disturbance, waterlogging in the lower parts of the plain would have a greater impact on productivity than nutrients provided by sediment. In other studies, the balance between these two environmental variables was sometimes a dominance of the negative effect of waterlogging on productivity [16,85,86], and sometimes a dominant positive effect of nutrients or water availability [18,87]. In particular, Rodriguez-Gonzalez et al. [17] found lower radial wood growth in the wettest areas for Alnus glutinosa and Salix atrocinerea forests in the Iberian Peninsula, which are quite similar to those considered in our study. In our study, a combination of both factors—waterlogging stress and a more intense disturbance regime—explains the lower biomass found in the lower parts of the floodplain.Finally, VUs located far from the main channel (i.e., higher horizontal distance to the river) had a lower biomass. This effect was most noticeable beyond the first fifty meters from the channel. In the study area, VUs far from the river were actually located in wide sections of the floodplain, in marginal depressions or in old channels disconnected from the river bed. These areas are enriched with fine sediments and are poorly drained. They are often occupied by shrubs such as Salix aurita, which have a low biomass.The factors structuring riparian biomass distribution are not yet well known in most regions of the world [7]. The proposed approach could be replicated in other regions in order to compare biomass distribution patterns. For example, with a drier climate, water availability may be more limiting [88]. The response of biomass to the vertical distance to the river, which was monotonous in our study, could in these cases present a peak at intermediate altitudes as proposed by Odum [89]. It would also be possible to compare areas receiving more or less rich sediments [90], to study the distribution of biomass in other geomorphological contexts, such as in braided rivers where mortality due to erosion may be higher [91], in larger catchment areas (by going further upstream or downstream), or in less anthropized areas.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Spatial Distribution of Biomass and Influencing Factors,4
143,"Our method essentially exploits LiDAR data, which are increasingly available at regional scales [22]. Most of the auxiliary data used are available in many countries (land use, river network) or can be derived from a LiDAR dataset (vertical distance to the river, slope, floodplain boundaries). Most countries do not have soil maps as precise as those available in Belgium, where the map is based on about two survey plots per hectare. However, soil variables seemed to be accounted for by topographical variables, and were not kept in the final MLR model. The age and type of regeneration can nevertheless be costly or tedious to obtain, as they rely on photo-interpretation of historical orthophotos, whose accessibility is uneven from one country to another.An advantage of the individual trees approach used in this study is its flexibility regarding spatial scale. For the needs of the study, segmented trees were grouped in 0.3 ha vegetation units. However, trees can easily be re-aggregated differently depending on pursued objectives. For example, one could study biomass in the immediate vicinity of the river (e.g., first 30 m from the water edge, where bio-geomorphic interactions are most intense) using the same delineated crowns and associated biomass estimates.We estimated only one compartment of the carbon stored by riparian ecosystems: the aboveground woody biomass. This is justified because it is the most variable compartment at a fine spatial scale and the most dynamic on time scales of a few decades [34,79]. Storage within the other compartments (especially in roots, soil and dead wood) is more difficult to measure, but it can have a significant magnitude and spatial variation, as shown by Wohl et al. [20]. These compartments are difficult to study by remote sensing, but could be modeled using topographic or geomorphological data, as in Suchenwirth et al. [34].", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Perspectives for Generalization of the Approach,4
144,"Our individual-tree, LiDAR-based approach enabled us to map aboveground biomass over 200 km of rivers with an error of 22% at the scale of 0.3 ha units. The addition of variables derived from the point cloud did not significantly improve CHM-based biomass estimates. For practitioners, the marginal improvement when working with point clouds must be balanced with the advantages of working with CHMs: robustness to varying survey conditions, ease of use, low computational requirements and possible update with photogrammetric point clouds.The biomass map was used to better understand the patterns of biomass distribution within the riparian zone. In the study area, vegetation age was the most important variable. Present land use was second, followed by geomorphological variables. Over the study area, anthropogenic factors (land use and vegetation age, which are related to human practices) were more important than geomorphic factors concerning biomass accumulation within vegetation.Surface biomass was higher inside forest, in higher topographical parts of the riparian zone and close to the river rather than in remnant patches in the agricultural landscape, and in low-lying areas further away from the river. The implementation of similar approaches in other catchments will be eased by the growing availability of LiDAR data at regional scales. Ultimately, remote sensing approaches could help understand how spatial biomass distribution patterns vary depending on the ecological context, and inform land use, conservation or restoration policies in riparian zones.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
145,"The Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) forest certification was developed in the early 1990s to reduce the deforestation and forest degradation caused by unsustainable forest management [1]. The FSC forest certification assures buyers/consumers that certified forest products have been produced from forests that have been responsibly/sustainably managed in terms of environment, economy and society. Certified forest products are expected to gain better consumer appeal over uncertified products in the market and eventually drive out uncertified products. Through this market mechanism, the deforestation and forest degradation caused by unsustainable forest management will eventually be mitigated.The FSC forest certification is issued when management entities comply with a set of criteria for ten principles in their forests and managements. Principle 5 stipulates criteria for enhancing benefits from the forests, including ecosystem services. Based on the FSC forest certification, one assumes that ecosystem services are responsibly managed in certified forests. However, FSC forest certification is by no means a system to quantitatively verify positive management impacts or the enhancement of ecosystem services [1,2]. Based on these considerations, the FSC has increasingly received demands to reliably certify important forest ecosystem services [3,4,5,6,7,8,9]. The FSC, therefore, pilot-tested a new system to directly certify the maintenance/enhancement of ecosystem services to promote ecosystem services payments and to further incentivize certificate holders [1,2,5,10,11,12]. The new system is expected to quantitatively demonstrate for businesses and investors that ecosystem services are maintained/enhanced in certified forests [11]. Ecosystem services include biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and storage, watershed services, soil conservation and recreational services [2,12,13]. The FSC suggested generic indicators for each of the five ecosystem services (Annex C, FSC-STD-60-004 V1-0-EN, International Generic Indicators; [13]). However, practical methodologies to evaluate the impacts of forest management on these ecosystem services are still undergoing improvement. Developing robust methodologies to quantitatively evaluate the impacts of forest management on these ecosystem services is urgently needed to support a reliable ecosystem-services certification system [2]. Moreover, many management entities, who wish to apply for the ecosystem-services certification (or other payment for ecosystem services and REDD+ schemes), may lack the technical capacity to measure the maintenance/provision of ecosystem services [1,14,15,16].Thus, methodologies to measure the maintenance/provisioning of ecosystem services must be simple and practical enough to be undertaken by management entities on the ground, while scientifically robust enough to accurately measure spatiotemporal changes of each ecosystem service [2]. In view of these challenges, the FSC encourages the development of “a small number of powerful and easy-to-measure proxy impact indicators” [17]. In addition to these technical requirements, the cost of measurements is another issue. Many certification/eco-labelling schemes are already associated with high transaction costs [1,18,19,20], and further adding a high cost of a ground survey for measuring ecosystem services will discourage stakeholders from applying for the ecosystem-services certification [1]. Jaung et al. [1] suggested bundling ecosystem services to reduce the certification cost per ecosystem service. The certification of multiple ecosystem services also has several other benefits: increasing incomes for management entities, allowing management entities to access diverse ecosystem-services markets, and encouraging management entities to adopt a holistic forest management approach [1]. Certification of bundled ecosystem services can also reduce the potential trade-offs between carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation [5], which is also an issue in Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation-plus (REDD+) as a biodiversity safeguard, because enhancing carbon sequestration by industrial plantation of exotic species will sacrifice biodiversity. However, again, the lack of methodologies to measure bundled ecosystem services presents a major challenge [1].In view of these technical challenges, we report here the results of testing our method to simultaneously measure carbon stock and biodiversity over a large area of tropical production forests. These two ecosystem services, among others, may be relatively easily incorporated into ecosystem-services certification because stakeholder adaptability is high for these services [10]. Our method “biodiversity observation for land and ecosystem health (BOLEH)” was developed primarily for evaluating forest intactness using a metric of tree community composition in logged-over tropical rain forests [21,22,23]: either species or genus composition could be used in this method. Earlier studies indicated that the use of genus composition was statistically equally reliable as species composition, and yet could reduce identification cost [21,22,23]. This approach is directly relevant to the FSC ecosystem-services certification because the following generic indicator for biodiversity conservation can be evaluated with our BOLEH: Management activities maintain, enhance or restore natural landscape-level characteristics, including forest diversity, composition and structure (stipulated in Principle 5, Annex C; FSC-STD-60-004 V1-0-EN International Generic Indicators; [13]).Furthermore, the recently published “Ecosystem Services Procedure” [12] suggests “conservation of intact forest landscape” as an important management impact in biodiversity conservation. Our BOLEH method can directly monitor spatiotemporal changes of forest intactness in a landscape context.In addition, BOLEH can derive carbon stock (density) values using the same dataset as tree community composition. We applied BOLEH to evaluate the spatiotemporal changes of carbon stock and forest intactness (tree community composition) in two contrasting forest management units in 2009 and 2014. Our test sites were Deramakot and Tangkulap in Sabah, Malaysia, which are now certified by the FSC yet having contrasting logging histories [24,25]. Deramakot has been harvested continuously with reduced-impact logging (RIL) since 1995, while Tangkulap was highly degraded by high-impact conventional logging which was operated until 2001. Logging is now fully suspended in Tangkulap, but the recovery of ecosystem services may be slow due to ecological aftereffects of the past high logging impacts and associated collateral damages. We report here the accuracy of estimating carbon stock and forest intactness (or tree community composition as an indicator of biodiversity conservation) using BOLEH and the patterns of spatiotemporal changes of these two ecosystem services between the two contrasting forest management units.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
146,"We collected data from the following forest management units (FMUs) in Sabah, Malaysia (Figure 1): Deramakot FMU (5°14′–28′ N, 117°20′–38′ E, 551 km2) and Tangkulap FMU (5°18′–31′ N, 117°11′–22′ E, 276 km2). Supplementary data were also collected from Segaliud Lokan FMU (5°20′–27′ N, 117°23′–39′ E, 576 km2). The three FMUs are adjacent to each other with the same undulating topography and the same equatorial tropical rain forest climate. Selective logging was a major driver of the changes of carbon stock and tree community composition in these forests. The elevation ranges from 12 m to 355 m. The original vegetation is a lowland dipterocarp rainforest throughout the three FMUs.The areas of the three FMUs were initially logged in 1956, 1970 and 1958, respectively, using conventional logging methods (i.e., high-impact logging with no environmental considerations). In Deramakot, conventional logging continued until 1989, when all logging activities were halted for regrowth [25]. Then, a long-term management plan with RIL was introduced to Deramakot in 1995. RIL is an improved method of selective logging, including pre-harvest inventory, mapping of all canopy trees, directional felling, liana cutting, and planning of skid trails, log decks, and roads [26]. In combination with reduced-impact logging, a longer cutting cycle (i.e., 40 years) was strictly adhered to in accordance with the long-term management plan. These combined approaches helped to preserve forest intactness [24,27]. Deramakot was the first tropical forest certified by the FSC in 1997, and was considered a model of sustainable forest management by the Sabah Government [25,26]. Reflecting this logging history, we observed that the forests inside the Deramakot FMU were less disturbed based on aboveground biomass and various biological communities [27]. In contrast, Tangkulap was repeatedly logged using conventional logging until 2003 and all logging activities were suspended thereafter. Tangkulap was entirely designated as a conservation forest in 2008 and later also certified by the FSC in recognition of its conservation-oriented long-term management plan in 2011. Both Deramakot and Tangkulap are currently managed directly by the Sabah Forestry Department. By contrast, Segaliud Lokan was repeatedly logged using conventional logging until 2002, after which RIL was implemented by the KTS Plantation Corp. Several areas were converted to plantation forests. It is currently certified by the Malaysian Timber Certification Council (MTCC). In the following analysis, we compare spatiotemporal changes of ecosystem services, including carbon stock and forest intactness, between Deramakot and Tangkulap. A comparison of these two FMUs may elucidate differences between their respective spatiotemporal patterns in ecosystem services, reflecting the difference in past logging intensity, despite the fact that they are now both FSC-certified. We excluded Segaliud Lokan from this comparison because BOLEH was designed primarily for natural forests. The occurrence of plantation forests in Segaliud Lokan would interfere with the analysis. However, we included natural-forest data of Segaliud Lokan for the following remote-sensing analysis to enhance data points and statistical reliance. ", 2. Methods , 2.1. Site Description,2
147,"A total of 50 circular plots (20-m radius with 0.126 ha area each) were placed in the FMUs from December 2011 until May 2012 (hereafter 2012 inventory). Plots were placed with a stratified random design to represent various forest statuses, ranging from a near pristine high-stock forest to a highly degraded low-stock forest. Prior to the placement of plots, the entire area was stratified to 6 degradation strata, from primary forest (stratum 1) to highly degraded, open area without trees (stratum 6), with the aid of Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) band-7 imagery (see Imai et al. [21] for the detailed procedure). Imagery obtained in 2010 was used for the stratification procedure. Briefly, we radiometrically converted Landsat data into Top-of-the-Atmosphere (TOA) reflectance values. Illumination artifacts caused by heterogeneous topography were reduced following the sun-canopy-sensor (SCS) model using TOA values [28]. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data were employed to correct for illumination artifacts. After masking all non-forest pixels, band-7 values were categorized into 6 strata using a level slicing method. Subsequently, we randomly placed 10 plots in each stratum of the five strata, except for stratum 6. Stratum 6, which is devoid of forests, was not actually sampled. Therefore, we established a total of 50 plots in strata 1 through 5. The distance between any two plots was greater than 100 m in order to minimize spatial autocorrelation.All trees with ≥10 cm in diameter at breast height (dbh) were measured in dbh and identified as genera (actually operationally to species) in each circular plot. Voucher specimens were collected from the trees that could not be identified in the field and later used for identification at the herbarium of the Forest Research Centre, Sandakan. A polyvinyl chloride (PVC) stake was driven into the ground at the center of each circular plot as a permanent marker, and the exact coordinates (latitude and longitude) above the stake were recorded by averaging for two hours using a portable Global Positioning System (GPS). In August 2014, we repeated the same procedure to inventory the forests as of 2014 (hereafter 2014 inventory). This time, we placed a total of 88 20-m-radius circular plots again evenly in strata 1–5 (actually, some of the plots had a 30 m × 40 m rectangular shape with approximately the same area as the circular plot because we used these rectangular plots for another purpose). None of the 88 plots overlapped with the 2012 plots because random sampling was deployed. In reality, a total of 50 plots would have been sufficient to derive reliable values of carbon stock and forest intactness according to our standard protocol manuals; however, we added 38 more plots that were placed for another research purpose to enhance model accuracy.", 2.

148,"We used the following two Landsat images to elucidate the temporal changes of carbon and forest intactness between 2009 and 2014 at the landscape level:Landsat TM acquired on 11 August 2009 (Path117/Row56)Landsat Operational Land Imager (OLI) acquired on 06 June 2014 (Path117/Row56)The raw digital numbers of each image were converted into top-of-atmosphere radiance. Subsequently, top-of-atmosphere radiance was converted to surface reflectance to compensate for atmospheric scattering and absorption effects using an atmospheric correction algorithm based on the Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum radiative transfer code (version. 1.1, [29,30]). The topographic effects on illumination were removed using the method described in Ekstrand [31] with Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data. Finally, pixels covered with clouds/shadow were removed according to the procedure described in Fujiki et al. [22]; pixels covered/affected by cloud/shadow were clustered as segments based on a homogeneity criterion with eCognition Developer 8.7 and all segments above a certain threshold were removed as cloud/shadow. Removed segments were filled in using the cloud-free areas of temporally adjoining data. Calibrated cloud-free parts of adjoining secondary images were incorporated into the missing parts of the base image (see Fujiki et al. [22] for the details). We used ERDAS Imagine version.11.0 and ArcGIS 9.3.1 for these pre-processing procedures.", 2. Methods , 2.3. Pre-Processing of Satellite Images,2
149,"Above-ground biomass (AGB) of each plot was estimated according to the allometric equation obtained by Chave et al. [32] as:

AGB = ρ × exp(−1.499 + 2.148ln(D) + 0.207(ln(D))2 − 0.0281(ln(D))3),


(1)


where D is dbh (cm) and ρ is the wood-specific gravity (g/cm3). We obtained the wood-specific gravity ρ for the sampled species/genera from various sources (see Imai et al. [21] for the detailed procedure). We estimated AGB of each plot for both the 2012 and 2014 inventories. Subsequently, the estimated AGB of each plot was multiplied by 0.48 to derive the amount of carbon.A multivariate regression model was established with the amount of carbon per plot as a dependent variable and reflectance of the corresponding pixel on a Landsat image as an independent variable. Here, textural metrics of the 3 × 3 pixels surrounding each plot were also added as independent variables. The amounts of carbon derived from the 2012 inventory were regressed with the reflectance and textural metrics of the 2009 Landsat imagery (Landsat TM, Path117/Row56, 11 August 2009). The amounts of carbon derived from the 2014 inventory were regressed with the reflectance and textural metrics of the 2014 Landsat imagery (Landsat OLI, Path117/Row56, 06 June 2014). The 2012 inventory data were regressed with the 2009 Landsat imagery without correcting for the tree growth between 2009 and 2012 for a first approximation of the 2009 condition because there were neither 2009 inventory data nor clear 2012 Landsat images; this was logical because all plots measured in 2012 were also present in 2009. However, modeling using the 2012 inventory data without the correction for tree growth would slightly overestimate the modeled 2009 carbon stock. The following Landsat metrics were used as independent variables: reflectance value of each band (Band1TM/OLI, Band2TM/OLI, Band3TM/OLI, Band4TM/OLI, Band5TM/OLI, Band6OLI, Band7TM/OLI), NDVI [33], normalized difference water index (NDWI) [34,35], normalized difference soil index (NDSI) [36], and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) [37]. We calculated mean value of each Landsat metric within a 20-m radius from the center of a plot to represent the plot. The normalized indices were calculated as follows:

NDVI-TM(OLI) = (band 4(band5) − band 3(band4))/(band 4(band5) + band 3(band4)),


(2)



NDWI-TM(OLI) = (band 3(band4) − band 5(band6))/(band 3(band4) + band5(band6)),


(3)



NDSI-TM(OLI) = (band 5(band6) − band 4(band5))/(band 5(band6) + band 4(band5)),


(4)



EVI-TM(OLI) = 2.5 × (band 4(band5) − band 3(band4))/(band 4(band5) + 6 × band3(band4) − 7.5 × band 1(band2) + 1),


(5)

In addition, we used the following metrics as proxies for spectral heterogeneity because degradation of forest canopies might affect the heterogeneity of the spectral pattern: the coefficient of variation (CV), standard deviation (SD), and textures of the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) [38]. CV, SD, and textures of the GLCM were derived using a 3 × 3 pixel window based on the reflectance values and each of the normalized indices. GLCM is a tabulation explaining how often different combinations of gray levels occur at a specified distance and orientation in an image object [39]. Homogeneity, contrast, angular second moment, entropy, dissimilarity, correlation, mean, and standard deviation were derived as the indices of the textures. Overall, 120 and 132 metrics were generated based on Landsat TM and OLI, respectively. For developing an adequate regression model, independent variables were selected using a stepwise selection from the full model containing all metrics to avoid multi-collinearity among the independent variables. We did not find significant multi-collinearity because the variance inflation factor (VIF) of selected independent variables, which is an indicator of multi-collinearity, was in all cases less than 10. Established models are shown in Table 1. Subsequently, each of the models (2009 and 2014 models) was extrapolated to the entire area to estimate the amount of carbon outside the inventory plots based on the 2009 or 2014 Landsat imagery. We took a Monte Carlo approach to show model accuracy and to test for significant differences of mean AGB values between 2009 and 2014 for a given FMU, or between FMUs for a given year (2009 or 2014). Four-fifths of the plots in each stratum (e.g., a total of 40 plots in the case of 2009, and 70 plots in 2014) were randomly selected to construct the AGB models for 2009 and 2014, respectively. The model predictions for AGB of the remaining one-fifth of the plots were regressed with the observed values both for 2009 and 2014, and the adjusted R2 values were determined. Based on these models, we estimated the mean AGB value each for Deramakot and Tangkulap each in 2009 and 2014. These steps were reiterated 1000 times for 2009 and 2014, respectively, to derive the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of the adjusted R2 and the mean AGB values. The statistical tests were conducted using R ver. 3.20 [40].", 2. Methods , 2.4. Estimating Spatiotemporal Changes of Carbon Stock,2
150,"It has been well established that tree-species/genus composition is one of the best indexes of the magnitude of forest degradation [21,23,27]. Similarity of the species/genus composition of a given forest with that of pristine forests decreases linearly with increasing magnitude of degradation of the forest [21,27]. We applied this principle to the forests of Deramakot and Tangkulap and evaluated the status of a given forest in terms of its compositional similarity with pristine forests [21]. The compositional similarity with pristine forests is termed here “forest intactness” and can be mapped through a special extrapolation procedure [22]. Here, we compared generic composition among plots instead of species composition because logging causes similar shifts in generic composition as in species composition [21,23]. The procedure of mapping “forest intactness” for a given time has been described by Fujiki et al. [22]. We elaborate here on the procedure to elucidate temporal changes of “forest intactness”.Firstly, differences in community composition among these plots laid out for estimating carbon storage were examined by using an ordination technique. We used a composite of the data of both the 2012 and 2014 inventories to derive a single data matrix to allow for a comparison between these two years using standardized scores. The Chao distance [41] and the number of trees of each genus were used to calculate a distance matrix. An ordination of plots was conducted with non-metric multidimensional scaling (nMDS) using the “metaMDS” procedure in the Vegan package in R [42]. Although plots were located distantly from each other, we could not completely rule out the possibility of spatial autocorrelations among plots. Therefore, we tested autocorrelations among plots, but did not find significant effects of spatial autocorrelations (see Figure S1, Supplementary Materials).A multivariate regression model was established with the derived nMDS axis-1 scores of plots as dependent variables, and reflectance and textural metrics of the corresponding pixels on a Landsat image as independent variables; the nMDS axis-1 scores of the 2012 inventory plots were regressed with the 2009 Landsat TM imagery and those from the 2014 inventory were regressed with the 2014 Landsat OLI imagery, as was conducted for the carbon analysis. We did not correct the nMDS axis-1 scores of 2012 when regressed with the 2009 imagery because the tree growth during 3 years between 2009 and 2012 would not substantially change tree-species composition. We used the same Landsat metrics as a carbon stock estimate in this analysis. Established models are indicated in Table 2. Each model was extrapolated to the entire area on the 2009 and 2014 Landsat imagery, respectively. This procedure yielded the maps of forest intactness for 2009 and 2014. We also took a Monte Carlo approach to test significant differences of mean nMDS axis-1 scores between 2009 and 2014 for a given FMU, or between FMUs for a given year (2009 or 2014) [22]. Four-fifths of the plots in each stratum were randomly selected to construct the 2009 and 2014 model, respectively. Based on these models, we estimated mean nMDS axis-1 scores for Deramakot and for Tangkulap in 2009 and in 2014. The model predictions for nMDS axis-1 scores of the remaining one-fifths of the plots were regressed with the observed values both for 2009 and 2014, and the adjusted R2 values were collected. Based on these models, we estimated mean nMDS axis-1 scores for Deramakot and for Tangkulap in 2009 and in 2014. These steps were reiterated 1000 times each for 2009 and 2014 to derive the 95% CIs of the adjusted R2 and the mean reiterated nMDS axis-1 scores. The statistical tests were conducted using R ver. 3.20 [40].", 2. Methods , 2.5. Estimating Spatiotemporal Changes of Forest Intactness,2
151,"Carbon density values were mainly explained by the short-wave infrared reflectance (band 7), textures of GLCM and NDSI of Landsat metrics based on the stepwise selection (Table 1). A comparison of observed logarithmic vs. predicted logarithmic carbon values is shown in Figure 2; the coefficients of correlations (adjusted R2) of the full model using all plots were 0.75 for 2009 and 0.71 for 2014. Cross-validation based on 1000 iterations indicated that the 95% CIs of the mean coefficients of correlations were 0.54–0.91 for 2009 and 0.69–0.72 for 2014 (Figure 2).Maps indicating the extrapolated carbon densities (Mg/ha) over the entire area of the FMUs for 2009 and 2014 are shown in Figure 3. Mean values (95% CIs) of carbon density (Mg/ha) of Deramakot were 140 (133–151) for 2009 and 170 (162–179) for 2014, while those of Tangkulap were 115 (109–122) for 2009 and 119 (112–126) for 2014 (Figure 3). The mean iterated carbon density value of Deramakot significantly increased from 2009 to 2014 without an overlap in 95% CIs, while that of Tangkulap did not significantly increase and showed a broad overlap of CI (Figure 4).", 3.

152,"The greatest variance of generic composition occurred along axis 1 of the nMDS ordination (stress values 0.179; Figure S2, Supplementary Materials). Derived nMDS axis-1 scores of plots significantly correlated with logarithmic AGB of the plots (which was considered a surrogate of forest degradation) (adjusted R2 = 0.69, p < 0.0001; Figure S3, Supplementary Materials) in line with Imai et al. [21]. Thus, nMDS axis-1 scores of plots were used as a forest “intactness index” in our analysis.Forest intactness values (nMDS axis-1 scores) based on the stepwise selection were mainly explained by the short-wave infrared reflectance (bands 5 and 7), NDSI, EVI and textures based on the stepwise selection (Table 2). A comparison of observed vs. predicted nMDS axis-1 scores (i.e., intactness index) is shown in Figure 5; coefficients of correlation (R2) for the full model using all plots were 0.61 for 2009 and 0.64 for 2014. Cross-validation based on 1000 iterations indicated that 95% CIs of the mean coefficients of correlations were 0.19–0.90 for 2009 and 0.42–0.83 for 2014 (Figure 5).Maps indicating the extrapolated forest intactness values (nMDS axis-1 values) over the entire area of the three FMUs are shown for 2009 and 2014 in Figure 6. Mean (95% CI) forest intactness values of Deramakot were 0.211 (0.130–0.306) for 2009 and 0.333 (0.271–0.405) for 2014, while those of Tangkulap were 0.062 (−0.018–0.142) for 2009 and 0.019 (−0.061–0.091) for 2014 (Figure 6). The mean iterated forest intactness value of Deramakot increased with a slight overlap in 95% CIs, while that of Tangkulap did not significantly increase and showed a broad overlap of CI (Figure 4).", 3.

153,"The BOLEH method successfully elucidated the spatiotemporal changes of carbon density and forest intactness as maps across the three FMUs between 2009 and 2014. The procedure to map forest intactness was already well described by Fujiki et al. [22], who demonstrated forest intactness maps of six FMUs across Borneo. They demonstrated that the mean values of and the frequency distributions of forest intactness significantly differed among FMUs, reflecting the forest management schemes. Our current study further demonstrates that the BOLEH method is useful to monitor temporal changes of forest intactness in a given FMU. Particularly, our BOLEH method could reveal a significant increase of mean carbon density value and a marginally significant increase of mean forest intactness value in Deramakot between August 2009 and June 2014 (time of acquisition of Landsat data) in spite of the continued production of timber. Deramakot FMU produced a total of 43,023 m3 volume of round logs in two compartments during the corresponding five years. The increases in both mean carbon density and forest intactness suggest that the regrowth in fallow compartments outweighed the harvest. Our BOLEH method based on landscape analysis could successfully evaluate such a balance between negative impacts of harvesting and positive impacts of leaving areas fallow. Co-benefits of sustainable forestry with RIL on the carbon storage function have already been suggested by Imai et al. [24], Langner et al. [43] and Langner et al. [44], who compared Deramakot with Tangkulap with a snapshot of carbon density in a given year using a space-for-time approach. In our current analysis, we have directly proved the co-benefits of sustainable forestry and RIL on the carbon storage and forest intactness by continuous monitoring. The vast majority of production forests across Malaysia and Indonesia in Borneo have been mildly to highly degraded due to past multiple entries of logging. Deramakot is not an exception. The mean annual harvest with RIL from such degraded secondary forests is 30 m3/ha and the mean annual harvest area is 347 ha over the 20 years between 1995 and 2016 in Deramakot (unpublished statistical data). Collateral damages are also unavoidable even if timber is carefully harvested under RIL. If we assume that harvest practices with collateral damage produce 30 m3/ha of waste (i.e., equivalent to the harvested volume), a total of 60 m3/ha of trees are removed annually from 347 ha, giving rise to a total removal of 20,820 m3/year (or 10,410 tons carbon/year in Deramakot assuming that 1 m3 volume is equivalent to 0.5 ton carbon). On the other hand, there are a total of approximately 54,653 ha of fallow compartments each year in Deramakot. Tree regrowth with an increment of merely 0.19 ton carbon/ha/year will make up for the removed carbon of 10,410 tons. Our results indicate that mean carbon density significantly increased from 140 (133–151) ton/ha to 170 (162–179) ton/ha during 5 years from 2009 to 2014, which is equivalent to 6 tons carbon/ha/year including harvested compartments. The ratio of mean harvest area to the fallow area is 347 ha to 54,653 ha, and this wide ratio (i.e., a long rotation) is important to sustain the surplus in carbon budget in secondary production forests. Therefore, Bornean tropical production forests with a comparable biomass stock and a comparable management plan (a long rotation period and moderate harvesting) to those of Deramakot will likely be assured of an increase of carbon stock. On the other hand, mean forest intactness only marginally increased between 2009 and 2014 in Deramakot, as indicated by the fact that the 95% CIs overlapped slightly between these years. Why did the mean forest intactness not significantly increase while the mean carbon density significantly increased during the same period? Probably, a longer time is required for tree communities to recover in species/genus composition, while carbon increments can occur as a simple function of time. There must be a shift of tree communities (from pioneer to climax species) in order to demonstrate a significant increase of forest intactness. For instance, a vast area of young pioneer -tree stands will support a rapid carbon increment but not an increment in forest intactness because species composition is rather stabilized in such stands. Therefore, monitoring of both ecosystem services (carbon and forest intactness) is necessary for the meaningful evaluation of ecosystem integrity/health. Why the mean carbon density and forest intactness did not increase in Tangkulap between 2009 and 2014 in spite of the suspension of logging operations is an intriguing question. As reported by Kitayama [27], the natural forests of Tangkulap have been highly degraded by past repeated logging; they are currently dominated by stands of pioneer trees such as Macaranga or by fern grasslands. The shift from such pioneer stands to climax stands will be extremely slow. On the other hand, the slow recovery of carbon stock is puzzling because the building phase of secondary succession is known to accumulate carbon at a rapid rate. Poorter et al. [45] reported a median carbon accumulation rate of 3.05 ton-C/ha/year in secondary forests at 20-year age in the Neotropics. Our estimate of the carbon accumulation rate in Tangkulap is merely 0.8 ton-C/ha/year, although this value was not statistically significant. Probably, the occurrence of vast, thick fern stands is related to the slow recovery because the regeneration in such thick fern stands is extremely slow [46]. When forest regrowth is analyzed, such fern stands tend to be avoided for sampling by ecologists. Moreover, mean tree mortality may be greater in senescent pioneer-tree stands (Imai, personal observation). Therefore, landscape-level evaluations based on remotely sensed data like our BOLEH are required to elucidate the spatially and temporally explicit patterns of carbon (and forest intactness). Another possible reason for the slow carbon accumulation in Tangkulap could be the use of the 2012 inventory data for developing the 2009 carbon model without correcting for the tree growth between 2009 and 2012, because this would slightly overestimate the carbon density for 2009. However, this would not be an important weakness of our study, because our major objectives here were to test our algorithms, but not to investigate the carbon dynamics per se. The FSC ecosystem-services certification has set forth a standard by which forest managers must verify at least the non-existence of net negative management impacts on ecosystem services [12]. The 5-year period seems to be adequate for verifying that there are no net negative management impacts on carbon density or forest intactness using our BOLEH in the case of Deramakot. However, in an FMU where the harvested volume outweighs regrowth (i.e., net negative impacts), the 5-year period may not be long enough to demonstrate a statistically significant negative impact (i.e., reduction in mean values of carbon and forest intactness) because 95% CIs tend to be fairly wide in our method. Fujiki et al. [22] discussed the reasons for wide CIs and suggested that the number of plots was too small for cross-validation. When outlier plots are used to develop a model (to explain carbon or forest intactness with Landsat metrics), residuals become large, giving rise to disproportionately large or small mean values; this must be the case for the very low coefficient of correlation (i.e., 0.19) in the 2009 nMDS cross-validation. The coefficient of correlation for the lower 95% CI in the 2014 nMDS cross-validation was relatively high (i.e., 0.42) probably because we used a total of 86 plots. Here, we still suggest using a total of 50 plots as standard sampling for reducing field efforts. If we maintain this standard sampling procedure, wide 95% CIs will be inherent to our methods. Therefore, forest managers should use our method only when mean values of carbon and forest intactness tend to increase or to be stable in order to verify the non-existence of net negative impacts for the FSC ecosystem-services certification. The 5-year period is equivalent to one period of an FSC forest certification. If BOLEH is incorporated into the assessment procedures of the regular FSC certification for sustainable management, forest managers can verify the enhancement of ecosystem services with low cost in addition to criteria pertinent to environmental values and impacts (principle 6) and monitoring and assessment (principle 8). It should be noted, however, that forest intactness cannot be used as a surrogate of richness of biological taxa because compositional distances from a pristine forest are unrelated to richness of biological taxa [21,27].", 4. Discussion,None,4
154,"The BOLEH method could elucidate spatiotemporal changes both in carbon stock and biodiversity (tree community composition or forest intactness) during 5 years for nearly 100,000 ha of logged-over tropical rain forests, which reflected past logging intensities and current management regimes. Field sampling can be completed within a few months by a team of four or five workers with minimal support from experts. In our pilot test, expertise of tree identification was provided by the local Forest Research Centre. When such expertise is not locally available, tree identification must rely on external botanical experts. However, the BOLEH method uses genus instead of species abundance, which can reduce the burden of tree identification. The BOLEH method is useful as a standard method to verify the maintenance/enhancement of carbon stock and biodiversity conservation to meet the requirements of the FSC ecosystem-services procedure. The whole of the above procedures from field sampling to statistical analyses to extrapolation are compiled as a protocol manual and can be downloaded at the following website:http://www.rfecol.kais.kyoto-u.ac.jp/files/Boleh%20manual%202017.1.zip", 5.

155,"A large number of studies have focused on quantifying the height of woody vegetation at regional to global scales from remote sensing data, with these based primarily on radar interferometry (e.g., the Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) from 2000) and Tandem-X (from 2010 onwards) or spaceborne LiDAR (namely, the ICESat/GLAS from 2003–2008). In the case of radar interferometry, continuous (wall-to-wall) height mapping has been achieved. As examples, [1,2] used SRTM data to generate height maps for mangroves in Africa and forests across the conterminous United States, respectively. However, with the ICESat/GLAS data, the landscape is only sampled and hence a mechanism for extrapolating the retrieved height or other measures across the remaining landscape is necessary [3,4,5]. Several early approaches to extrapolation have been developed using airborne LiDAR data. For example, [3,4,6] related ground-based or airborne LiDAR-derived estimates of biomass or volume to intersecting ICESat/GLAS metrics thereby allowing these measures to be extrapolated across the landscape, albeit as samples. Wall-to-wall mapping of vegetation height was achieved by [7], who used the eCognition software to generate a nested segmentation of the landscape based on the SRTM National Elevation Dataset (NED)-derived slope, the SRTM-NED difference and the National Land Cover Database (NLCD) of canopy density. They then extrapolated associated airborne Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor (LVIS) metrics across segments based on an inverse weighted distance. Ørka et al. [8] also generated a wall-to-wall coverage of canopy cover by extrapolating estimates from airborne LiDAR data using a random forest, non-parametric classification of Landsat-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, Tasseled Cap transformed brightness and wetness, and elevation and slope data.Coarse resolution (~0.5° × 0.5°) gridded global vegetation height map, such as Los et al. [9], can be derived directly from aggregated ICESat/GLAS footprints with filters (e.g., slope, elevation, area under first Gaussian) applied to remove anomalous data. However, previous work to extrapolate ICESat-derived height metrics to form continuous height surfaces at moderate spatial resolution has relied on the use of other spatially continuous moderate resolution remote sensing datasets. For example, Lefsky et al. [10] associated ICESat footprints with forest area segments (based on spectral and textural heterogeneity properties) generated from MODIS data. For those segments without GLAS data, canopy height prediction equations were developed for each of six geographic regions using Cubist (a rule-based modeling approach) to extrapolate using MODIS attributes such as forest cover fraction, brightness, principal component bands, greenness indices, and cover and biome type. In a similar fashion, Simard et al. [11] employed a Random Forest regression tree method to model RH100 values (the distance between signal beginning and the location of the lidar ground peak) based on global climate and vegetation variables (precipitation, precipitation seasonality, annual mean temperature, temperature seasonality, elevation, percent forest cover, and protection status) for areas not covered by GLAS waveforms [9]. Chi et al. [12] extended this approach by adding an improved slope correction method. However, these continental scale methods have all relied on optical data, predominantly from the MODIS sensor, thus limiting the spatial resolution of the final map.This study recognized the benefits of low frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) for providing information on the woody components of vegetation which was complementary to the use of optical data. Hence the aim was to investigate the use of ALOS PALSAR L-band HH and HV data and Landsat-derived Foliage Projective Cover (FPC) [13] for extrapolating ICESat/GLAS waveforms and associated vegetation height and cover metrics across Australia with a view to generating a new national structural classification. The objectives were to (a) use the ALOS PALSAR and Landsat sensor data to segment the Australian landscape into structurally homogeneous units, given their sensitivity to the woody and foliage components of vegetation respectively, (b) cluster these segments using these same data to establish those that were most similar, (c) associate each resulting class with height and cover metrics derived from ICESat/GLAS waveform data thereby allowing national extrapolation, and (d) evaluate the accuracy of metric retrievals through reference to airborne LiDAR data to give confidence in the resulting product.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
156,"Australia has a diverse landscape, with this conveyed by the division into 89 largely distinct bioregions defined through the Interim Biogeographic Regionalization for Australia (IBRA) on the basis of similarities in climate, geology, landform, native vegetation and dominant plant species. These regions are further divided into 419 subregions [14]. Nearly 91% of Australia (or nearly seven million km2) is occupied by vegetation (Figure 1), with forest occurring over 21.3% of the area. Over 23% of the country is dominated by hummock grasslands, with these largely occurring in West Australia, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. Forests are associated with vegetation dominated by trees having usually a single stem and a mature or potentially mature stand height exceeding 2 m and with the existing or potential crown cover of overstorey strata ≥20%. The classification of Specht [15] relevant to forests is based on the three structural attributes of height and foliage projective cover (FPC) of the tallest plant layer as well as dominant functional type or plant form (trees or shrubs; Table 1). Within the classification system of Carnahan [16], additional floristic information is included (e.g., whether the dominant genus present in the upper stratum (primarily) is Eucalyptus, Acacia, Banksia, Casuarina, Hakea, or Melaleuca). Australia’s National Vegetation Information System (NVIS; [17]), which standardized vegetation information across the States and Territories, also recognized height and cover as important descriptors and used these in conjunction with floristic information and terminologies of Specht [15], Specht and Specht [18], and also Walker and Hopkins [19] to classify 23 Major Vegetation Groups (Figure 1). Trees and palms are associated with closed and open forest, woodland and open woodlands and isolated clumps of trees. Shrublands are typically < 2 m in height but mallee (which occurs in the more semi-arid area) supports shrubs and trees that are up to 8 and 10 m, respectively. The NVIS utilized existing and many finer detailed classifications undertaken by the Australian States and Territories to generate the nationally consistent classification. Within the mapping, and at the time of generation, noticeable discontinuities were observed between datasets and there were gaps in scale, current, and detail.", 2.

157,"ALOS PALSAR L-band Fine Beam Dual (HH and HV) mosaic product data for 2010 were provided at 25 m spatial resolution through the Japanese Space Exploration Agency (JAXA) Kyoto and Carbon (K&C) Initiative. These data had been orthorectified, topographically corrected and calibrated using procedures outlined by Shimada et al. [20]. The orthorectification utilized a DEM simulated from SRTM data and ALOS PALSAR strips acquired during periods of relatively low surface moisture were used to generate the mosaic as proposed by Lucas et al. [21]. Correction procedures were also applied to remove across and between track variations in backscatter associated primarily with varying moisture conditions and incidence angles. Using multi-year (1987 to 2010) dry season (May to October inclusive) Landsat sensor data, a 30 m spatial resolution FPC product for 2010 was generated, from which the seasonal signal associated with herbaceous vegetation had been removed [13]. These data were combined into a 30 m spatial resolution image stack by cubic convolution resampling of the ALOS PALSAR mosaics onto the Landsat FPC product pixel grid. ICESat/GLAS L2 (Release 33) Global Land Surface Altimetry (GLA14) data acquired between 2003 and 2009 were obtained from the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC). These data were acquired over variable footprint sizes and intensities but footprints were distributed unevenly across the landscape. An overview of the available datasets is provided in Figure 2, which shows a color composite of the Landsat FPC, ALOS PALSAR L-band HH and HV data (in RGB) with the ICESat tracks across Australia.", 3. Methods, 3.1. Remote Sensing Data,3
158,"The approach to extrapolation of the ICESat height metrics (Figure 3) focused first on segmentation (based on k-means clustering and iterative elimination; [22]) of the ALOS PALSAR HH and HV and Landsat FPC data and subsequent classification of the resulting segments. A k-means clustering of the mean HH and HV and Landsat FPC values within each segment was then undertaken to provide clusters of segments with similar backscatter and cover statistics. The k-means method was used as it represented the simplest reproducible and scalable method that was applicable to the classification task and other approaches (e.g., agglomerative hierarchical clustering, mean shift, and variational Bayesian Gaussian mixture models) were too slow and memory intensive for our dataset size. ICESat-derived structural metrics were then assigned to all non-intersecting segments based on their class allocation. Finally, validation of the height metrics was undertaken through reference to independently acquired airborne LiDAR data across and range of forest structural types. The following sections outline these steps in more detail. 3.2.1. Segmentation of ALOS PALSAR and Landsat DataTo define homogeneous regions for classification, the segmentation approach of Shephard et al. [23] was applied to the ALOS PALSAR L-band HH and HV and Landsat-derived FPC in combination. This method was chosen as it provides a highly scalable open source framework enabling continental scale segmentation and also support for a minimum mapping unit through an iterative elimination process. Initially, the input data were normalized based on a two-standard-deviation normalization to ensure that all bands were equally weighted. A k-means clustering was used subsequently to identify the mean spectra within the images where the number of clusters, k, was user defined (in this case, 60). The image pixels were then subsequently labeled according to the k-means cluster numbers before being merged into discrete regions. Regions under a minimum user defined object size (a threshold of 100 pixels was used in this case) were then removed iteratively, being merged into the neighboring clump with the shortest Euclidean distance defined using the normalized L-HH, L-HV and FPC values. The elimination started with features 1 pixel in size and incrementally eliminated features of larger sizes in 1-pixel steps (i.e., 1 to n pixels). When all neighbors were of a size equivalent to the current feature, no further elimination took place and the feature was only then eliminated in a subsequent iteration. Following elimination, the features were relabeled to ensure that they were numbered sequentially. Examples of the segmentation are shown in Figure 4. 3.2.2. Clustering of SegmentsCollectively and broadly, the ALOS PALSAR HH and HV data and the Landsat FPC broadly provide a spatial indication of the relative amounts of trunk, large branch, and foliage within the forest volume [24]. Hence, objects generated through segmentation of these data should represent, in principle, vegetation of similar structure. However, due to landscape and landform variability and fragmentation, segments associated with forests of similar structural form may be separated spatially. Therefore, the k-means clustering algorithm (from scikit-learn; [25]) was used to classify segments into clusters with similar values of L-band HH and HV and Landsat FPC. For this, the elbow method was used to estimate the optimal number of clusters. It is noted that the ‘elbow’ cannot always be unambiguously identified [26] so a certain amount of manual interpretation is required to achieve the best results. The percentage of variance explained as a function of the number of clusters was calculated by generated statistics for cluster numbers between 100 and 8000. In this application, it was important to cumulate as many ICESat returns in each class as possible, whilst still retaining a sufficient number of clusters to capture the variability in Australian vegetation communities. Figure 5 shows that the elbow can be found at around 500 clusters. In this work, 1000 classes were selected after visual inspection of the 500-cluster classification showed some important smaller landscape features areas (such as patches of regrowth and plantation) were being linked to classes in quite different environments. 3.2.3. ICESat/GLAS ProcessingThe ICESat orbital strip data, which were provided in binary format, were decoded using a data dictionary to extract the location, elevation, time, pulse eccentricity, intensity and size as well as the Gaussian decomposition parameters of the retrieved waveform. The sequence of processing is outlined below.In determining the profile relating to the vertical distribution of plant material, the ground return was assumed to be the Gaussian with the lowest elevation, thereby allowing separation from the vegetation return. Whilst in the majority of cases, correct retrieval occurs, multiple ground pulses may occur in areas of complex terrain or no ground pulse will be received when the canopy cover is extremely high. Across much of Australia, the landscape is relatively level (with slopes typically < 5°) although there are significant areas of relief (e.g., on the east coast), including within gorges and river channels. Following identification of the ground return, each individual vegetation ICESat/GLAS pulse was reconstructed from the Gaussian decomposition using

The waveform, cumulative vertical cover profiles and the canopy cover were used to calculate four canopy height metrics, with these being the mode (height to maximum vegetation density), average (with values above representing more than 50% of green material) and the 75th and the 95th percentile. These represented the height of peak cover and the vertical position where the cumulative foliage profile equals 50, 75, and 95% of the nominal cover estimate respectively. Cover was also derived as an integral of the waveform and as a function of amplitude. The roughness of the ground layers was described using the standard deviation of the ground surface. The height and cover metrics were calculated for slopes < 5°. When this threshold is applied, the canopy of the tree on the lower slope is still above the ground on the upper slope. In some studies (e.g., [27]), a correction for slope was applied using existing elevation layers including the SRTM [27] and the US National Elevation Dataset (NED) [28]. In others (e.g., [29]), a minimum slope of 10° was used; however, a more stringent threshold was applied in this case given that the forests considered are lower in stature compared to other studies (e.g. [29]). The impact of slope is illustrated in Figure 6, which highlights the variability of waveforms in steeper terrain.", 3. Methods, 3.3. Vertical Cover Profile Derivation,3
163,"One issue with estimates using ICESat in particularly dense forests is that the height is typically underestimated, with the reason being minimal penetration to the ground surface. For this reason, the fitted Gaussian return can often merge the understorey and ground returns, particularly when the ground surface is rough. However, a monotonic relationship is observed between the ground surface standard deviation and the 95th percentile height for any given cluster (Figure 7), indicating a systematic bias in percentile heights. Since high slope areas are filtered out of the analysis, large ground surface standard deviations are attributable to local roughness or a merging of the ground and understorey layers. This bias in percentile height (

164,"Within each of the classified segments where ICESat waveforms intersected, a description of the forest structure was generated, with this including standard statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation) for height and cover metrics. Pulses were omitted if the slope was > 50, with this being lower than the 10° threshold suggested by Rosette et al. [30]. A minimum of seven returns was needed to provide a description, with this minimum determined a priori based on progressive omission of profiles from segments with larger numbers (e.g., 50 waveforms). Consideration was also given to the location of the points and the laser used, as different laser intensities and signal to noise ratios (SNR) occur; hence the pulse were normalized. Variations in the pulse size were also considered.", 3. Methods, 3.5. Imputation of Metrics,3
165,"Validation of height metrics derived from the ICESat/GLAS foliage profiles was achieved by comparison with equivalent airborne waveform LiDAR derived foliage profiles generated at a number of existing Terrestrial Ecosystem Research Network (TERN) Landscape Assessment sites across Australia (Table 2). The TERN sites were selected to represent dominant and/or conservation significant biomes in Australia and be suitable for scaling up from field and airborne measurements to continental scale map products for calibration and validation purposes [31]. Each site was approximately 5 × 5 km and was acquired by Airborne Research Australia (ARA) using a RIEGL LMS-Q560 waveform recording airborne laser scanner. The wavelength of the instrument laser was 1550 nm, the nominal flying height was 300m, the instrument laser pulse repetition rate was 240 kHz, and wall-to-wall coverage of each site was acquired with 50% swath overlap between flightlines.Due to the availability of airborne waveform LiDAR, vertical cover profiles were retrieved directly using the approach of Armston et al. [32], which previously developed and validated a simple method for the retrieval of Pgap(θ,z) using Gaussian reconstructed waveforms calibrated to apparent reflectance. In this study, we extended the approach to map Pgap(θ) at high spatial resolution across large areas. If the method of [32] is to be widely useful, a practical mapping approach applicable at the sampling resolution of different waveform instruments was required. According to Equation. 16 from Armston et al. [32], we can estimate Pgap (1-C) by calculating from the attenuated signal, which only requires a modeled estimate of the ground apparent reflectance (

The vertical cover profile estimates were then aggregated to the segment level at each of the TERN Auscover sites. These outputs were used to directly validate the retrieval of height metrics at the segment level to test the assumption that the segments represented forests that were structurally homogeneous.", 3. Methods, 3.6. Validation,3
166,"Based on the correspondence between the ICESat canopy height metrics assigned to segments generated from ALOS PALSAR and Landsat FPC and independent measures, a map of canopy height was generated at the national level (Figure 8). The highest forests (up to and sometimes exceeding 60 m) were associated with forests in the wetter and more mountainous and/or coastal areas of Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. Tall forests were also located in southwestern Australia. The majority of woodlands were less than 25 m in height and occurred throughout the semi-arid zones.

; Figure 9c) and derived height metrics equivalent to those derived from ICESat/GLAS (Figure 9d–f).The comparison of height metrics (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, and 0.95 percentiles) derived from the segment vertical cover profiles (Figure 10) indicated substantial variation within individual TERN Auscover sites. However, on average these were <10 m (Figure 11c) for the largest height percentile (0.95). Comparison of Figure 10a,b demonstrates that the height metric bias correction reduced the absolute mean differences between the RIEGL and ICESat/GLAS estimates of height percentiles. This was particularly the case for the 0.95 height percentile for the taller forests (Warra and Watts Creek) where there was >10 m reduction in mean absolute difference and final mean differences of <5 m. Across all the TERN Auscover sites, the relative differences were lowest in the upper canopy height metrics (0.75 and 0.95 percentile). The Pearson correlation coefficient between the REIGL and ICESat/GLAS metrics was greatest for the 0.95 percentile (>0.7).", 4. Results, 4.2. Comparison with Airborne LiDAR Products,4
168,"The 30 m spatial resolution forest structural map for Australia generated by cross tabulating the ICESat/GLAS 0.95 percentile height and total plant cover fraction estimates is shown in Figure 11. Following Table 1, the ICESat/GLAS total plant cover fraction was assumed to be equal to the overstorey crown cover. A 1:1 relationship between LiDAR plant cover and crown cover has been observed for a subset of Australian plant stands by Fisher et al. [34]. However, the generality of this relationship needs further examination over a larger number of sites. The ICESat/GLAS 0.95 percentile heights at 9 and 28 m were assumed to be equivalent to the NVIS 10 m and 30 m height thresholds for the medium and tall woodland/forest categories, respectively.The map provides considerably more spatial detail compared to the historical classifications generated previously by Specht [15], Carnahan [16], and the NVIS [17] as variability at the pixel and object level (through integration of the Landsat sensor products and ALOS PALSAR data) of height metrics from the ICESat/GLAS is captured by the product. Furthermore, users are able to a directly access information on the vertical structure of woody vegetation as derived from the ICESat/GLAS profiles associated with each class.As expected, most (82%) of the forests in Australia were associated with the woodland and isolated tree classes and were largely confined to the interior with taller closed forests located predominantly around the coastal regions of eastern Australia, Tasmania, and southwestern Australia (Table 3). The area of structural formation classes are different to those previously reported by Specht [15], Carnahan [16], and the NVIS [17] due to:
The height and cover of dryland woody vegetation (woodland and isolated trees classes) are better represented in the products generated in this study, which was supported by the validation of ALS products (e.g. detection of low trees at the Alice Mulga TERN Auscover site; see Figure 10). This translates into greater extent in the structural formation map, which is also consistent with the findings of Bastin et al. [35].This study has used SAR and vegetation cover datasets that were only recently available at the national level, and were resampled to 30 m resolution for segmentation in this study. The resulting fine scale of this data product, compared to Spectht [15], Carnahan [16], and the NVIS [17], will also contribute to the difference in areal extents, particularly for forest classes which are often small and patchy across the landscape and may include riparian areas.There is considerable uncertainty introduced by thresholding, since a small change in a height and cover threshold may lead to a large change in areal extent for a given class. The use of ICESat data, while leading to an improved product, is not optimized for vegetation and may limit the detection of low vegetation (<5 m) and differentiation between classes. The smaller footprint of the upcoming NASA GEDI instrument (~25 m) will reduce this uncertainty.", 4. Results, 4.3. Structural Formation Map,4
169,"Several studies (e.g., [36,37,38]) have highlighted the benefits of integrating data from spaceborne optical sensors, SAR and/or ICESat for better characterization of forests. However, this is the first to demonstrate the use of the combination of all three datasets at a spatial resolution (30 m) that is appropriate for resolving detail at a management scale within the landscape. The segmentation and subsequent classification of the landscape benefits from the use of the Landsat FPC and the ALOS PALSAR L-HV and L-HH, with these channels broadly relating to the amount of foliage (and the small branches that support these), the larger branches within the canopy volume and the trunks respectively. By using these three channels in the segmentation and classification process, areas that are similar in terms of their overall structure are more likely to be captured. Whilst other studies have used segmentation and gridding approaches [9,10], these have focused primarily on the use of optical remote sensing and ancillary data and often do not consider the different structures associated with the woody components. The option to include a digital elevation model (DEM) to build derived measures (e.g., slope; [7]) was not followed, as the terrain is relatively level across much of Australia with minimal surface variation but warrants consideration in future updates of the mapping. However, the SRTM data was effective in removing those returns that were biased as a consequence of slope effects and their inclusion in hillier terrain should be considered.The height metrics obtained from the airborne LiDAR data agreed with those obtained from the ICESat across a wide range of landscapes, with substantial improvement provided by the height metric bias correction. These results give confidence that the waveforms and derived metrics could be extrapolated across the landscape. The difficulty with the comparison between the airborne LiDAR and the segmented landscape was one of height metric accuracy at the ICESat footprint scale and the trade-off between the number of segment clusters and precision of height estimates across the range of vegetation structural formations across Australia. It is anticipated that, in the future, the greater availability of smaller footprint spaceborne LiDAR with denser spatial sampling will improve both accuracy and precision. ", 5. Discussion, 5.1. Segmentation and Classification of the Landscape,5
170,"Within this study, height metrics retrieved included the 50th, 75th, and 95th percentiles as well as mean height and the height to maximum vegetation density. However, such metrics have proved difficult to obtain, particularly for savannas and other less dense vegetation. This has been attributed to their short height compared to many closed canopy forests. Furthermore, the power of the canopy return is reduced and the contribution from sloped terrain is increased [7]. Lee et al. [28] also noted that waveform extent and vegetation height were underestimated, with the latter by as much as 15 m for very sparse and also dense forests because of saturation in the dense canopy and at the ground respectively. The retrieval of heights in this study was however successful in many woodland areas as the slopes were generally <10°, trees (emergents) were as tall as or exceeding 60 m (with the majority being <20 m), and the canopy cover was relatively low (between 20% and 70%).The consistency of the waveforms within segments across the class range reflected the ability of the segmentation applied to Landsat FPC and ALOS PALSAR HH and HV data to define the extent of forests with similar structural characteristics. The vertical profiles extracted from the ICESat data could also be interpreted in relation to the forest type as well as growth stage. For example, within forests that had remained relatively undisturbed since European settlement [39] and which had received minimal natural interference since the late 1980s (i.e., were regarded as remnant), layering within the vertical profile was observed. These profiles differed for both open and closed forests, with this reflecting the variable amounts of plant material within the vertical profile. Where a multi-layered profile with a distinct regrowth layer was observed, disturbance events (e.g., fires, selective logging) were suggested. Regrowth forests were typically single layered and of relatively low stature, but the profiles often showed the influence of a small number of emergent trees still existing within the mapped segments.", 5.

171,"Estimates of forest canopy height have been generated previously by Lefsky [10], Simard et al. [11], and Scarth et al. [40] and extracts were compared to those generated in this study in Figure 12. With the map generated by [40], each of the RE units was associated with a canopy height estimate derived from the LiDAR. However, only those polygons associated with remnant vegetation were analyzed and disturbance within remnant areas (e.g., through wildfires) was not considered. In retrieving and extrapolating height estimates, [11] used a grid-based system and assigned height metrics according to the Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Centre (LP DAAC) MODIS land cover categories. The study of [10] similarly used a segmentation of the MODIS data but only referenced profiles from tropical broadleaf forests in Brazil, temperate broadleaf forests in Tennessee, and temperate needleleaf forests. For Australia, the height map generated in this study was most comparable to that generated by [11]. The previous map of [40] omitted large areas because of the focus on remnant ecosystems (RE) only, omitting large areas of regenerating woody vegetation. The map of [10] omitted large areas of forest as the study did not detect the lower stature (typically <20 m) trees associated with more open forests and woodlands [7].", 5. Discussion, 5.3. Comparison with Other Studies,5
172,"Whilst the generation of the Landsat FPC has allowed estimates of vegetation cover to be produced at moderate (<30 m) spatial resolution, reliable retrieval of canopy height and the distribution of plant material within the vertical profile has remained a significant challenge [40]. The methods conveyed in this paper demonstrate, for the first time, a robust approach to retrieval of a range of height metrics and descriptors across the landscape. Additional information (e.g., on biomass levels) can also be provided through reference to the ALOS PALSAR L-HH and L- HV data [21]. The combination of the derived products (cover, height and, in the latter case, biomass) has significant potential to facilitate the establishment of better baseline estimates of carbon stocks and changes in these as a consequence of clearance or wildfires, with these able to be mapped using time-series of Landsat sensor data. In terms of biodiversity, knowledge of the height and dimensions and number of layers within the forest column is important for assessment purposes, particularly given that many studies have found a close link between species richness (e.g., of birds, reptiles) and forest height [41]. The datasets generated address the requirement for information on essential biodiversity variables (EBVs), namely height, cover, and above ground biomass [42]. The integration of the three datasets also facilitates a better interpretation of these, which benefits future users in gaining and understanding of how these can be exploited for a range of applications.It is important to note that this is a demonstration product developed under the auspices of the JAXA Kyoto & Carbon Initiative, and therefore should be independently evaluated before use in operational environmental monitoring programs. The approach using segmentation and imputation is simple and may be applied to data from the upcoming confluence of active remote sensing instruments designed for vegetation measurement (e.g. NASA’s GEDI and NISAR) to reduce uncertainties in height and cover retrievals, and subsequently aboveground biomass mapping.", 5. Discussion, 5.4. Wider Applications,5
173,"This study has established and applied a method for characterizing the height profiles of woody vegetation across Australia from ICESat data, with this benefiting from the segmentation of the ALOS PALSAR L-band HH and HV data and Landsat-derived FPC and clustering of the segments into distinct structural classes. The approach extracted vegetation profiles from segments with available ICESat data and then extrapolated these to other segments assigned to the same class. The accuracies of retrieval for canopy profiles and metrics (e.g., height) were at an acceptable level and profiles were similar within segments of the same class. The maps provided a better representation of the known distribution of stand heights compared to those generated previously. As ALOS PALSAR, Landsat sensor and ICESat data were available across Australia, the approach was applied nationally and the resulting data products have been made openly available (http://dx.doi.org/10.4227/05/5703458340442). The approach can also be applied subsequently to ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 (and in future NISAR), Landsat or Sentinel-2-derived FPC or persistent green vegetation cover and from 2019 the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and ICESat-2 data, which we anticipate will considerably reduce uncertainty in the vertical cover profile mapping and derived products. Once generated, a wide range of applications relating to carbon budgeting and science, biodiversity assessment and conservation, and better forest management are anticipated.", 6. Conclusions,None,6
174,"Successful forest conservation, management, and restoration require detailed information on forest structure and composition, which are vital decision-making components and modeling inputs. This information has been commonly used to assess current condition, compare management outcomes, and in the case of forest restoration, monitor the success or failure of moving a degraded ecosystem towards recovery. Efforts to quantify ecological patterns and processes typically necessitate precise data on the amount and distribution of biotic and abiotic resources, estimates of how resources may change over time, and assessments of disturbance [1]. These activities often require costly and resource-intensive spatially explicit data, and to be useful for conservation and management of forested ecosystems, need to include site-specific information on vegetation pattern (sizes and species), fuel conditions and arrangement, wildlife habitat suitability, and operational condition [2,3,4].However, compounding costs, reduced workforce capacity, and increasing scales for planning and implementation often make information obtained from direct field measurements (i.e., plot samples) inadequate, incomplete, or altogether impossible despite being the standard for field data collection. Remote sensing platforms have become increasingly popular with resource managers, which can push the limits of information acquisition when describing forest resources at landscape-scales [5,6,7,8,9,10]. Chief among these tools has been lidar, with newer technologies such as terrestrial (TLS) and mobile laser scanning (MLS) being increasingly investigated for applications in forest ecosystems [11,12,13,14,15]. The restoration and management of ecologically sensitive frequent fire forests of the southwestern United States requires the ability to make rapid assessments prior to treatment and frequent monitoring of post-treatment ecological outcomes. Mobile laser scanner systems offer a powerful tool to ease the time and labor demands of traditional plot-based sampling while potentially providing accurate and highly precise estimates of basic forest structural conditions [12,13]. While fixed-wing airborne laser scanning (ALS) platforms have been commonplace for decades, more recently, terrestrial and mobile lidar systems have been investigated for characterizing forest structure, as their higher point densities allow for more detailed and robust extraction of structural attributes, sub-canopy occlusion of smaller trees and other ecologically important species can be reduced, and their data can be collected more frequently than airborne systems [13,16,17,18,19,20,21]. While the absolute positional error of points collected by MLS was typically less precise than TLS due to the propagation of positioning errors accumulated during scan registrations (e.g., see Figure 1), MLS made use of localization algorithms (e.g., SLAM; Simultaneous Localization and Mapping), which enabled accurate positioning of the scanner in vegetated environments where GNSS and GPS signals were typically hindered by dense canopies and the movement of MLS may have reduced overall occlusion [13,15,22]. Terrestrial and mobile lidar may be particularly effective for monitoring changes in forest ecosystems, especially where species composition and structural complexity were relatively simple and where periodic or time-sensitive measurements were needed [21,23,24]. Historically, individual tree segmentation algorithms applied to lidar datasets have relied on the forest canopy to initiate and delineate trees. However, this process becomes complicated where interlocking crowns exist, an ecologically relevant and common occurrence, and tends to miss trees which do not extend into the dominant crown layer. Recent years have seen new approaches for delineating individual trees, including layer stacking methods [25] and graph-based segmentation approaches [26,27,28]. One of the primary necessities to accelerating ecological restoration in forested ecosystems, especially in the frequent fire forests of the western US, has been the accurate and timely assessment of forest structure. However, information concerning effectiveness of mobile lidar systems for monitoring and rapid assessment of forest conditions were lacking. Stemming from this need, we sought to understand how forest structural estimates resulting from mobile and terrestrial scanning systems compare to more established estimates coming from aerial lidar and traditional field-based forest monitoring plots. More specifically, in this study, we compare methodologies for assessing (a) individual-tree, (b) stand-level, and (c) canopy cover and landscape metrics attributes derived from rasterized canopy height models among datasets obtained from ALS, TLS, and MLS platforms across a range of forest conditions in a ponderosa pine forest of northern Arizona, USA. Resulting tree and forest characteristics were compared to assess relative accuracies across scale.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
175,"For this study, we focused on a pure ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest near Flagstaff, AZ where we could make use of previously collected ALS and TLS lidar datasets (Figure 2) [18]. These sites were managed by the US Forest Service as part of the “Fire and Fire Surrogate” study network [29] with original treatment objectives including fuels reductions [30]. In brief, the study design presented an ideal tree density gradient resulting from four treatments: thinning from below (thin-only), broadcast burning (burn-only), a combination of thinning from below with subsequent broadcast burning (thin-and-burn), and an untreated control (Figure 2). Mean elevation was 2270 m with slight variation in slope (<5%) and aspect. Mean annual precipitation was 546 mm, which falls as rain during monsoons (July–September) and snow in the winter months [31]. Average yearly temperature extremes ranged from −12 to 28 °C [30]. ", 2.

176,"Field data for twelve sample plots were collected in summer 2020 with plot locations placed to maximize existing TLS scan coverage and stratified along a tree density gradient. We used circular plots (0.04 ha) and centers were recorded with a Trimble Geo7X GPS and differentially corrected using Trimble’s Pathfinder Office. For all trees with a measurable diameter at breast height (DBH; measured at 1.37 m above ground level), location was mapped using a LaserTech MapStar TruAngle angle encoder and TruPulse 200X laser rangefinder (±0.05° and ±4 cm accuracy, respectively), and DBH, height, height to the base of the live crown, species, and condition (alive or dead) were recorded. Summaries of the field data were shown in Table 1. Data consisted of 209 ponderosa pine trees on 12 sample plots, with densities ranging from open conditions (25 trees ha−1) to dense, closed canopy, conditions (1361 trees ha−1). While denser conditions for contemporary forest have been reported for nearby sites, e.g., [32], the conditions observed were a unique opportunity to explore patterns of tree detection and estimation accuracy for typical ponderosa pine forest conditions across western USA.

177,"The ALS data used in this study was collected in August of 2018 to QL1 specifications (a minimum point density of 8 points per m2). ALS point density across our site was 19.8 points per m2. A Riegl VQ 1560i lidar sensor was flown at an altitude of 1800 m, collecting up to 1.3 million points per second. The data were processed to industry specification, including bare earth model generation, point classification, and cleaning of the resulting point cloud data. The vertical accuracy was reported at 0.085 m for non-vegetated elevation and 0.14 m for vegetated elevation. Mobile lidar data was collected using a GeoSlam Zeb Horizon (www.geoslam.com/us/zeb-horizon/; accessed on 30 March 2021) handheld mobile laser scanner in May 2020. The scanner was initiated at each plot center and walked in a flower petal design with three “petals” radiating from center towards north (0° heading), southeast (120° heading), and southwest (240° heading) with a final ring around the 0.04 ha plot. The scanner employs a Velodyne VLP-16 scanner on a rotating mount, resulting in a scan acquisition with a nearly total field of view around the device collecting 300,000 points per second. While the device is constantly collecting information once initiated, individual scans are tied together using GeoSlam’s proprietary SLAM algorithm, resulting in a unified point cloud of the scan area. The resulting point cloud contains a large amount of positional “noise” (compared to ALS and TLS), largely stemming from the Velodyne scanner and the SLAM algorithm, with a resulting point accuracy of 1–3 cm. As stated in the previous section, we designed this study to coincide with an existing terrestrial lidar dataset employed in a previous study [18] where the authors examined occlusion and effective distances for terrestrial scanning in forested environments. The scanner, a Riegl VZ-1000 is a survey-grade terrestrial scanner with a range of over 1400 m and integrated inclination sensors for real-time orientation and can acquire up to 122,000 points per second and has a 360° horizontal and 100° vertical field of view. All scans were conducted between August 2015 and March 2016. Individual scan locations were established between 70 and 100 m from a central scan and registered to one another using Riegl’s proprietary software. We used ALS data as positional reference for the mobile and terrestrial lidar datasets by manually shifting (rotation and translation) point clouds to ALS data, then using an iterative closest point algorithm to further match our lidar datasets. In this way, trees segmented from one dataset represent the same trees segmented in another, and thus our analysis produced fair comparisons. For all datasets, we classified ground points using the cloth simulation filter method [33] and normalized the point clouds. We performed minimal noise filtering to remove spurious high and low noise from the point clouds.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Lidar Data Acquisitions and Processing,2
178," 2.4.1. Segmentation Approaches We investigated multiple individual tree segmentation algorithms appropriate to each dataset by employing methods that utilized the point cloud in a manner consistent with the mode of acquisition for each lidar platform. All point clouds were first normalized to remove the effects of elevation and topography after identifying likely ground points using the cloth simulation filter algorithm [33] as implemented in the lidR package (v3.0.4) [34] in the R (v4.0.3; R Core Team 2020) environment. For the airborne lidar dataset, we investigated top-down approaches as the sensor directly observes the top of the canopy and more accurately describe canopy height. Specifically, we tested two commonly used tree segmentation approaches implemented in the lidR package: a seeded region-growing approach [35] and a region growing approach which works within the point cloud [36]. From our initial testing, we found the Dalponte and Coomes [35] algorithm more accurately segmented trees from our ALS dataset and so we performed the full analysis with this method alone. We obtained DBH for each ALS segmented tree using a nonlinear least squares regression model based on the observed relationship between height and DBH for 2116 ponderosa pine trees in Arizona [37]. Terrestrial and mobile lidar platforms produce less reliable canopy heights than ALS data as they operate below canopy, however they are able to directly observe tree boles. For these platforms, we developed a custom methodology which made use of eigen-values calculated within point neighborhoods, a measure of relative neighborhood point density, random sample consensus (RANSAC) cylinder fitting and a shortest path graph theory approach to delineating individual trees using a set of custom functions in conjunction with the TreeLS package (v2.0.2) [38].For terrestrial and mobile lidar datasets, our analysis approach (Figure 3) determined tree locations and estimates of DBH by rasterizing individual point cloud values of relative neighborhood density (0.3 and 1 m radius) and verticality within a slice of the normalized point cloud around breast height (1.34 m). We then defined threshold values to classify the resulting rasters and created unique polygons from the resulting classified raster. These point-density and verticality polygons were selected by their intersection with one another, resulting in a final set of polygons which were used to clip out regions of the point cloud that were most likely to represent tree boles. We then used a random sample consensus (RANSAC) cylinder fitting algorithm from the TreeLS package (v2.0.2) [38] to identify individual bole points. Cylinder centers and radius were used as inputs to an individual tree segmentation approach which follows ecological principles for “growing” trees based on these input locations in a graph-theory approach inspired by work of [27]. Point coordinates were linked together based on proximity and turned into a graph object, using the estimated tree bole locations as origin points, connecting individual points back to those origins based on shortest paths within the graph network, and finally those points were assigned to unique tree identifiers based on the bole coordinate to which they were connected. The R scripts, released under GPL-3.0 license, used for processing and performing individual tree segmentations (Figure 3), can be found at https://github.com/bi0m3trics/spanner, accessed on 30 March 2021.  2.4.2. Tree-Matching and Error EstimationAfter segmentation, each segmented tree set (ALS, MLS, TLS) was matched to the corresponding field measured trees. To begin the matching process, a 3 m radius buffer was constructed around each field measured tree to find potential candidate trees from lidar segmentations. We allowed for a larger buffer for taller trees by adding the tree height divided by the mean height of all field trees. The remaining segmented trees were then given a matching error to select the most similar tree. Differences in segmentation approaches (i.e., treetops for airborne vs. boles for terrestrial) created the need to use different attributes when estimating matching errors. For ALS, differences in height and location were used based on the top-down approach of segmentation (Equation (1)). ALS segmented trees with differences in heights greater than 2 m were excluded from matching until the next iteration (i.e., the next field tree was matched). Additionally, we weighted the field tree by their associated basal area to give more weight to larger trees.

Within each plot, detection rates were calculated as the number of matched trees divided by the number of field measured trees.

185," 3.1.1. Individual Tree Size and LocationKruskal–Wallis rank sum tests showed significant difference by platform between prediction errors for DBH, height and tree location (Figure 4). The post-hoc Dunn’s tests revealed that overpredictions of DBH by ALS were significantly larger than that of TLS and MLS (Figure 4a), for which the latter were not significantly different. Mean absolute error (MAE) for DBH was lowest for MLS (4.8 cm) and only slightly smaller than TLS (5.0 cm; Table 2). However, ALS predictions of DBH, which had to be derived from tree height, were found to be significantly higher with MAE of 9.1 cm (Table 2). Both ALS and TLS tended to underpredict total tree height (Figure 4b), and with corresponding MAEs of 0.7 m and 2.2 m. MLS was found to over predict height with a MAE of 1.3 meters. Tree locations from MLS exhibited the smallest prediction errors (Figure 4c), followed by those obtained by TLS and ALS, and all were significantly different with means under 1.27 m (Figure 4c). The same patterns were true for percent RMSE (Table 2).In examining individual-tree field observations versus platform-specific estimates (Figure 5), all three datasets produced estimates which appeared to overestimate smaller tree diameters (Figure 5a–c). MLS and TLS tended to overestimate DBH of trees smaller than 25 cm but produced more accurate estimates of DBH for trees greater than 25 cm (Figure 5b,c). Estimates of DBH derived from the ALS data displayed much greater variation, but in general, exhibited overpredictions of DBH among smaller trees and underprediction of DBH among larger trees (Figure 5a). Individual tree height was most accurately predicted by ALS, with very little variation from field measurements of tree height (Figure 5d). However, our displayed results do not emphasize that numerous trees went undetected using ALS (n = 103), as smaller and sub-dominant trees were often occluded from ALS. For example, no heights below 7 m were reported when summarizing ALS-derived tree heights (Figure 5d). MLS-derived tree heights tended towards overestimation as compared to both field measurements and TLS-derived estimates (Figure 5e,f), with the latter providing estimates that were lower than their observed height for several trees 15–25 m in height (Figure 5f). Tree locations varied the least among segmentations from MLS data using the workflow we developed (Figure 5g–i). While some increased error was apparent among trees further from plot center, MLS data exhibited a predominately uniform distribution of low individual-tree location errors (Figure 5h).  3.1.2. Plot-Level ObservationsAs summarized at the plot-level, MLS data in concert with the methods we developed for this study provided the most consistent segmentation of trees among plots with nearly 95% detection (Table 2). An important yet often unreported result was the fact that we were alerted to data entry errors (i.e., the absence of six trees among two plots in our field data) when making comparisons to MLS-based individual-tree segmentations. Stemming from tree segmentation, rates of omission (field trees not detected) and commission (field trees falsely created) were lowest from MLS outputs (Table 2). TLS plot-level estimates were less accurate at nearly 87% detection rate, but TLS had nearly double the rate of omission compared to MLS estimates. ALS estimates were much lower than those obtained from our terrestrially-based datasets, with a mean detection rate of 68.3% (Figure 2). Mean rates of omission and commission were generally large for ALS (31.7%, 53.2%), with commission on one plot exceeding the number of trees observed (Table 2). ", 3. Results, 3.1. Tree-Level Comparisons,3
186,"Kruskal–Wallis rank sum tests showed significant difference by platform between prediction errors for DBH, height and tree location (Figure 4). The post-hoc Dunn’s tests revealed that overpredictions of DBH by ALS were significantly larger than that of TLS and MLS (Figure 4a), for which the latter were not significantly different. Mean absolute error (MAE) for DBH was lowest for MLS (4.8 cm) and only slightly smaller than TLS (5.0 cm; Table 2). However, ALS predictions of DBH, which had to be derived from tree height, were found to be significantly higher with MAE of 9.1 cm (Table 2). Both ALS and TLS tended to underpredict total tree height (Figure 4b), and with corresponding MAEs of 0.7 m and 2.2 m. MLS was found to over predict height with a MAE of 1.3 meters. Tree locations from MLS exhibited the smallest prediction errors (Figure 4c), followed by those obtained by TLS and ALS, and all were significantly different with means under 1.27 m (Figure 4c). The same patterns were true for percent RMSE (Table 2).In examining individual-tree field observations versus platform-specific estimates (Figure 5), all three datasets produced estimates which appeared to overestimate smaller tree diameters (Figure 5a–c). MLS and TLS tended to overestimate DBH of trees smaller than 25 cm but produced more accurate estimates of DBH for trees greater than 25 cm (Figure 5b,c). Estimates of DBH derived from the ALS data displayed much greater variation, but in general, exhibited overpredictions of DBH among smaller trees and underprediction of DBH among larger trees (Figure 5a). Individual tree height was most accurately predicted by ALS, with very little variation from field measurements of tree height (Figure 5d). However, our displayed results do not emphasize that numerous trees went undetected using ALS (n = 103), as smaller and sub-dominant trees were often occluded from ALS. For example, no heights below 7 m were reported when summarizing ALS-derived tree heights (Figure 5d). MLS-derived tree heights tended towards overestimation as compared to both field measurements and TLS-derived estimates (Figure 5e,f), with the latter providing estimates that were lower than their observed height for several trees 15–25 m in height (Figure 5f). Tree locations varied the least among segmentations from MLS data using the workflow we developed (Figure 5g–i). While some increased error was apparent among trees further from plot center, MLS data exhibited a predominately uniform distribution of low individual-tree location errors (Figure 5h). ", 3.

187,"As summarized at the plot-level, MLS data in concert with the methods we developed for this study provided the most consistent segmentation of trees among plots with nearly 95% detection (Table 2). An important yet often unreported result was the fact that we were alerted to data entry errors (i.e., the absence of six trees among two plots in our field data) when making comparisons to MLS-based individual-tree segmentations. Stemming from tree segmentation, rates of omission (field trees not detected) and commission (field trees falsely created) were lowest from MLS outputs (Table 2). TLS plot-level estimates were less accurate at nearly 87% detection rate, but TLS had nearly double the rate of omission compared to MLS estimates. ALS estimates were much lower than those obtained from our terrestrially-based datasets, with a mean detection rate of 68.3% (Figure 2).

188," 3.2.1. Stand-Level AttributesUnlike patterns observed for predictions of individual trees, Kruskal–Wallis rank sum tests did not reveal any significant difference by platform between prediction errors for plot-level attributes of tree density, basal area, volume and aboveground biomass (Figure 6d–g). However, MLS-derived predictions of tree density were consistent with field-based estimates (R2 = 0.99) and displayed very little deviation from field-based estimates (Figure 6a). Both TLS- and ALS-derived estimates tended to underestimate with increasing tree density (Figure 6a). Basal area predictions were nearly equally predicted by MLS (R2 = 0.73) and TLS datasets (R2 = 0.74), with TLS data tending to underpredict with increasing field-observed basal area (Figure 6b). ALS-derived estimates varied with respect to corresponding field observations, producing least correlated estimates for both tree density (R2 = 0.91) and basal area (R2 = 0.56). Total stem wood volume exhibited the highest correlation with MLS-derived predictions (R2 = 0.68), which tended to increasingly underpredict with greater volume (Figure 6c). The same pattern was observed for TLS-derived predictions (Figure 6c). While agreement in ALS predictions fell close to the 1:1 line, plot-level comparisons were highly variable (Figure 6c). Estimates of aboveground biomass were also largely similar when predicted by MLS- (R2 = 0.66) and TLS-derived (R2 = 0.67) datasets, while TLS-derived estimates became increasing dissimilar with increasing biomass (Figure 6d). ALS-based predictions were highly variable relative to field observations. Comparisons of diameter distributions (by 5 cm classes) revealed various overall patterns, and all lidar datasets struggled to adequately represent the smallest (<10 cm) diameter classes (Figure 6e). Two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov Tests revealed the following: (1) the shape of the MLS and TLS diameter distributions did not significantly differ from the field-observed distribution shape; (2) MLS and TLS did not significantly differ from one another; and (3) both MLS and TLS differed significantly from the ALS distribution shape, which also differed significantly from the field-observed distribution shape. Under visual inspection, the MLS-derived diameter distribution tended to overpredict among the mid-sized classes and slightly underpredict among the largest-sized classes. The TLS-based estimates failed to capture the magnitude of the 10–15 cm diameter class, but otherwise adequately approximated the distribution of field observations (Figure 6e). Lastly, the diameter distribution derived from ALS performed poorly at capturing the lower end of the diameter distribution and grossly overpredicted among the larger-sized diameter classes (Figure 6e) with a threshold occurring around 40 cm DBH.  3.2.2. Canopy CoverDifferences in mean canopy cover derived from MLS data were nearly identical to that of ALS canopy cover (Figure 7a) up to and including a radial distance of 26 m from plot center (0.21 ha or 0.5 ac). Canopy cover differences from ALS continued to decline slowly to radial distances of approximately 40 m, after which differences from ALS increased. TLS differences in canopy cover declined gradually across the 100-m radial extent from plot center but were consistently underpredicted (as compared to ALS estimates). At approximately 50 m in radial distance from plot center, MLS estimates were comparable with TLS estimates of canopy cover (Figure 7a), after which MLS estimates underpredicted. Kruskal–Wallis rank sum tests of differences revealed that TLS estimates of canopy cover were not significantly different from ALS at buffered distances up to 98 m, while MLS-derived estimates of canopy cover were not significantly different up to buffer distances of 55 m (Figure 7a). 3.2.3. Landscape Metrics Comparisons of landscape metrics (mean and standard deviation in patch area and patch density) displayed consistent patterns among the lidar datasets (Figure 7b–d). Mean and standard deviation of patch area were consistently higher for ALS data values than those obtained from MLS or TLS (Figure 7c,d). Patch density displayed the opposite pattern (Figure 7b) and estimates changed very little for extents beyond 0.13 ha. Based on Kruskal–Wallis rank sum tests of differences (Figure 7), MLS was not significantly different among all extents examined for patch metrics. However, TLS patch metrics showed significant differences for extents of 0.13 ha and greater for patch density and patch area. Neither MLS nor TLS derived estimates of the standard deviation in patch area were significantly different among the extents examined. ", 3. Results, 3.2.

192,"MLS proved to be a useful tool for rapid assessment and monitoring across a range of forest conditions in a ponderosa pine forest of northern Arizona, USA. Lower accuracies found for our ALS and TLS estimates illustrate the problem created by occlusion [18,42]. Mobile systems overcome this issue by incorporating distance measurements from many views during data collection, meaning occlusion from any single look angle can be overcome by additional look angles [13,15]. Furthermore, the logistics of implementing mobile lidar data collection can be much simpler than other lidar platforms. For instance, our scan time ranged from three to five minutes per plot, and assuming SLAM processing could have taken place in parallel, it would have been reasonable to have scanned and processed all twelve plots within a few hours. The mobile platform was hand-held, meaning it could produce scans from a perspective where a person might walk and collect data, and this could be done very fast. While there was no need to extensively plan and orient fixed scan locations to minimize the effects of occlusion, as with TLS acquisitions [18], considerations of potential occlusion still need to be accounted for when utilizing MLS. Lastly, we emphasize the fact that terrestrially-based scanners (MLS and TLS) capture data from the ground, which can provide benefits over ALS when the scale of inquiry was individual- to stand-scale, such as more accurate representation of tree size classes.Though terrestrial-based scanners provided large benefits over ALS, occlusion and noise within TLS and MLS point clouds, respectively, impact their abilities to describe forest structure attributes accurately. Inherent to SLAM processing due to accumulated small registration errors, MLS data tend to be “noisier” than fixed location TLS data, resulting in a more “fuzzy” point cloud [13,43]. However, our work suggests that with minimal effort to remove the noise, the resulting data perform well in both identifying trees and deriving attributes for those trees. Due to our need to use existing TLS scans, our TLS data exhibited a range of occlusion that could have been reduced with a different arrangement of scan locations. Specifically, portions of tree canopies and small to large sections of individual trees were missing from our data, which led to greater underestimation for most structural metrics. ALS-based products commonly take advantage of allometric relationships or imputation to estimate forest structure, e.g., [44,45]. While ALS easily facilitated large area coverages and commonly estimated individual tree heights (as well as canopy-related attributes) accurately, ALS also displayed the highest omission and DBH estimation errors, with the latter likely resulting from variability in allometric relationships [42,46]. Given these limitations and our study’s forest structure, ALS poorly described the full gradient of individual tree- to stand-level structural conditions. This lack of adequately representing structural condition was most evident in when examining tree diameter distributions, but can also be seen in the inaccuracies reported for stand volume and biomass. Developing increasingly accurate allometric relationships from terrestrially based data could further capture variability in tree growth forms [20] and potentially improve predictions. Our tree detection and size errors results compared well with recent studies making use of terrestrially-based lidar systems for forest inventories, including estimates of individual tree height. Comparable studies examining individual tree diameters extracted from MLS and TLS datasets often yield between 1 and 5 cm RMSE, and commonly between 3 and 4 cm [15,21,43,47]. Estimates of tree height from terrestrially-based lidar datasets vary considerably, but generally tend to underpredict [14,15,21]. We were surprised at the generally low RMSE of tree heights obtained with our MLS dataset, which compared well to ALS errors in tree height. The lack of tools for easily processing terrestrially-collected lidar datasets in an automated fashion targeting conservation and management applications quickly became apparent in our work. While individual trees and corresponding bole sizes were readily apparent by the authors within the resulting MLS and TLS datasets, segmentation approaches either missed trees entirely or aggregated/produced trees much larger than reported by field observations. In general, we found that traditional segmentation approaches, such as canopy height model-based methods and methods using local height maxima for tree locations, performed rather poorly despite the relatively open forest conditions encountered in this study. For example, it is a common practice to directly extract individual tree heights from canopy height models, yet this approach is largely inadequate when sub-dominant canopy layers exist within a forests’ structure, and dense conditions can commonly make it unclear which heights relate to which trees. A recently developed layer stacking methodology [25], theoretically applicable to below-canopy lidar collection, still tended to not capture small diameter trees. As a result, it was necessary to develop methods for better identifying tree locations and performing segmentations in accordance with tree locations observed from below the canopy (i.e., DBH locations). We thus developed eigen-value based rasterization methods to identify tree boles and a segmentation approach which follows ecological principles [27,48,49]. While we endeavored to incorporate a gradient of forest structure conditions commonly found in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests, we were limited by the availability of coincident lidar datasets for the study. While ALS data coverage within the region continues to increase, areas with TLS datasets were very limited and thus why we chose our study site. While this site does provide a large range of forest structural conditions, the study design was also limited by the types of treatments that were originally implemented, as well as the lack of other gradient types, such as climate, soil type, number of canopy strata, or species mixtures. However, this site was typical of large swaths of ponderosa forests across the Southwest. Finally, placement of the TLS scan locations was determined by a previous study seeking to understand how to optimize scan locations within a gradient of forest conditions [18], not to scan multiple 0.04 ha plots. However, such a scan configuration would be typical of real-world TLS applications [17,50].The MLS data we derived exceeded our expectations and this same collection and processing methodology could be adapted and used in other forest systems. While the authors have no doubt that some of the findings in this study would hold true for different forest types (e.g., airborne platforms would produce the best individual-tree height and canopy cover estimates, terrestrial platforms would produce the best individual-tree location and diameter estimates, and MLS and TLS would outperform ALS in estimating stand-level estimates but are limited in application scale), MLS is a relatively new technology and more research is needed in other ecosystem types. Additionally, efforts to expand and improve the processing algorithms available for terrestrially-based forest lidar datasets are needed; for example, studies exploring the use of a greater number of decomposed eigenvalue metrics calculated at several scales may allow our methodology to better discriminate woody tree boles and tree locations. The structured walk we developed for this study and other 0.04 ha plots worked well in terms of acquiring even data coverage and we plan to experiment with other forms of structured walks for different sizes and shapes of study areas.

193,"Effective forest conservation, management, and restoration require a timely assessment of vegetation and forest conditions. ALS data were undoubtedly useful over large areas, but generally only provide insights into structural conditions covered by the dominant canopy and largest trees (i.e., as seen from above), commonly missing the lower end of the size class distribution or vegetation smaller in stature. While collecting TLS data can provide more accurate information with a “bottom up” perspective, the inherent structure of most forests produces particularly challenging conditions for how TLS may “see” the forest, as rates of occlusion or missing data quickly increase with forest density. Mobile systems are uniquely situated in that they are logistically fast and simple to operate, while providing detailed information consistent with how humans view the forest. The ability to quickly mobilize MLS data acquisition both pre- and post-treatment mean MLS data products could be produced quickly to provide time-sensitive insight into adaptive and multi-resource conservation and management. While landscape-scale data cannot be efficiently produced with MLS, it can be easily paired with other datasets, be it ALS data or satellite imagery, to provide location-specific and detailed information. Furthermore, MLS systems can be operated by a single person with minimal logistic planning and expense. The accuracy of our MLS derivatives exceeded our expectations, producing estimates well within the error constraints typically expected for vegetation inventory and monitoring guidelines and consistent with other studies around the world. We expect that we will see the eventual adoption of these technologies throughout resource conservation, management, and restoration practices in the very near future. ", 5. Conclusions,None,5
194,"Throughout the world there are a number of forest definitions. Some of these are formulated in national law and apply only to the forests of that state, while others are international. The differences in forest definitions arise from the different characteristics of forest vegetation around the world and the different forms of forest management [1]. In addition, the differences in forest area under different definitions are influenced by the geometric characteristics of trees [2,3,4,5,6]. There are also some economic and political reasons why different countries consider certain areas to be forests [7].One consequence of using different definitions is the discrepancy in area statistics between individual countries or continents. Depending on the data and methodology, the global rainforest area ranges from 1090 to 1220 million hectares, in Africa from 185 to 215 million hectares, in Asia from 235 to 275 million hectares, and in South America from 670 to 730 million hectares (Table 1) [8]. The difference in estimated forest area for 19 European countries was 13% [2], and the difference in area affected by deforestation in Indonesia during 2000–2009 was 27% [6]. These reported differences were the result of different definitions and methods used. The problem is exacerbated when a country is required to report its forest area to an international organization and forest definitions differ significantly.For example, Poland, like many other countries, is required to report forest area for the Climate Convention (Kyoto Protocol) and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO/UN). Reporting of forest area in Poland is based on data published in the statistical yearbooks “Forestry” and “Environmental Protection” of the Central Statistical Office. Details of the definition of forest area formulated for Poland in the Forest Act (Act on Forests, 1991), FAO/UN [9,10,11] and the Kyoto Protocol [12] are presented in Table 2 [13,14,15,16].The definition of forest in the 1991 Forestry Act (in Poland) does not require canopy cover or height. However, forest plantations established in state forests are considered successful if crown closure is at least 50% in the fifth year after regeneration. Conversion of agricultural land to forest land (under the Rural Development Program) occurs when the suitability determined on the basis of land cover is 50% for land with natural succession or 70% for artificial afforestation. However, there is still no minimum canopy cover and height required to recognize an area with forest vegetation as forests. Areas with or without forest vegetation may be also excluded or included in the forest area due to their land use. Moreover, there are many such rules that result in the forest area, which varies according to the definition used [13,14,15,16]. Ultimately, different forest areas are reported even for a single country.Since the methods used to define a forest area often vary from country to country, it is important to develop a methodology that is as homogeneous/utilitarian as possible. In line with Neef et al. [17], this allows a trade-off between reporting reliability, ecosystem characteristics and social and economic needs.The simplest methods for estimating forest areas include manual vectorization [18] and NDVI index-based analysis, including change detection analysis performed on multiple images [19]. Statistical estimation methods based on data from regularly distributed sample plots are an important means of estimating forest area in sparsely populated countries with a very high proportion of forested areas, where conventional in-situ inventory in each forest sub-area is simply impossible (e.g., Canada, Russia) [20,21,22,23,24,25,26].Aerial and satellite imagery have been successfully used since the early 2000s to estimate the area of forested areas with an accuracy of 80% for forest areas [20,21,22,27,28,29,30,31,32], 95% for secondary forests [18,19,33,34,35], and 75% for trees in agricultural areas [36]. Other sophisticated image-based methods include object segmentation and supervised classification [30,35], but few of them consider the geometric features of forest vegetation-height [32,34] and canopy [34] mentioned in the international forest definitions with an overall accuracy of 95%. However, their fractional values (1 m, 2–20% cover) do not correspond to the values given in the international forest definitions (2–5 m, 10%). Although image-based remote sensing technology is very useful for forest area estimation, its full potential has not yet been discovered and there are still many unsolved problems.Airborne laser scanning data (ALS) provide information on elevation, which is an important variable in forest definition. Currently, up-to-date ALS data are available in many countries worldwide (in Poland within the ISOK project—IT system of Country Shield) and are widely used for remote sensing analysis. Since, at least in Europe, there is already a nearly homogeneous ALS database covering almost all of Europe, it is important to develop automatic methods based specifically on the data from ALS. The use of ALS data makes it possible to achieve or improve the results of forest area estimations [22,26,32,34,35,36,37]. Single tree extraction based on airborne laser scanning data (ALS) has been discussed in numerous publications [38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47]. It allows the creation of a vector layer of polygons representing individual trees with the projection area and height. The collection of individual trees allowed the analysis of species and health status at the individual tree level [48]. However, ALS data has its disadvantages as well, e.g., ineffective during heavy rain or low hanging clouds, at high sun angles and reflections, low operating altitude of between 500–2000 m and a decreased ability penetrating very dense/thick forests.Land use is an important factor responsible for differences in official forest area statistics [5]. However, remote sensing methods can only classify areas in terms of their cover. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine the land use category according to BDOT (Spatial Object Database) or other national land use databases. There are areas of forest vegetation that are not forest land by various definitions (e.g., post-agricultural areas with secondary succession, swamps, etc.), and forest land that is permanently or temporarily not forested (e.g., areas with intensive forest management—clearcuts, wind damaged or burned areas, etc.). Species composition may also be an important factor, as some countries have plantations of industrial crops that may (or may not) be considered forests for political (rather than ecological) reasons [4,6].There is currently no consensus on how to determine the area for which tree canopy cover should be calculated [49]. Individual authors have investigated the accuracy of different methods, but none of them have attempted to compare these methods. Eysn et al. [50,51,52] and Sackov and Kardos [53] used a triangulation-based method that calculated the fraction of tree canopy cover for the area under the canopy of three adjacent trees and the intervening tree. They achieved an accuracy of 96–98.4% and 93%, respectively. Straub et al. [54] used a grid of squares with a defined mesh area for this purpose and achieved 97.7% accuracy. Wang et al. [27,28,29] calculated the percentage of pixels that were above a certain threshold using the Canopy Height Model (CHM) in a grid with a defined mesh area. A detailed description of the methods can be found in the “Methods” chapter.An important part of the remote sensing analysis related to forest area estimation is the accuracy assessment based on inventory data, which may differ significantly due to many factors, e.g., the number and distribution of sample plots, measurement methodology [3,54], or simply due to outdated records in existing databases [13,14,15,16,55]. When statistics are used in inventory procedures, sampling and inference methods can also affect estimation results [8]. This approach to collecting reference data is particularly useful in sparsely populated countries with a very high proportion of forest (e.g., Canada, Russia), where the forest area is too large to conduct a full in-situ field inventory. In Poland, the area covered with trees is classified as forest, rather than woodland, when preparing management plans according to the Forest Act (Poland, 1991), and it is based on a field survey of individual stands. Thus, in the case of the reference data, each stand was visited by a forest expert and many different characteristics were estimated or measured in the field (Table 2).In this paper, we focus on the use of airborne laser scanning data and the estimation of three variables that determine the presence of forest vegetation in the international forest definitions: Elevation, Crown Projection Area and Forest Complex Area, which have not been fully considered in previous works, i.e., [32,33,34].The objectives of the study were: (i) to determine the most accurate method, (ii) to calculate the differences between the analyzed methods according to the forest definitions used, (iii) to determine the most effective method in terms of accuracy (the agreement between the results and the reference data) and the complexity of the process (time and effort required to perform the analysis).This paper compares for the first time methods for determining the area for which canopy cover is calculated (using data from ALS) and discusses the differences between them in terms of accuracy (the correspondence between the results and the reference data) and the complexity of the process (time and effort required to perform the analysis). The area with forest vegetation is a starting point for assessing the forest area according to international definitions, taking into account land use and its future evolution, even without current forest vegetation. This in turn is important in the context of reporting, estimating carbon stocks and biodiversity to mitigate the effects of climate.", 1. Background,None,1.
195,"The study was conducted in the Milicz Forest District (Figure 1), which has a high variability in forest habitat characteristics (Table 3). Forest habitat type is a basic unit in forest habitat classification, which includes all forest areas with similar habitat conditions that have similar production possibilities. The volume of a stand is usually limited to roundwood, measured in cubic meters [56].The complex is primarily related to the oak–hornbeam habitat. It stretches from Młyńska Woda—a tributary of the Barycz River, to Żmigród, forming a line that is approximately 28 km long and up to 8 km wide. Mixed complexes were formed there, in which pine, sometimes spruce, oaks, hornbeams, beeches, birches, as well as ash trees, mainly high and low oak-hornbeam forests and beech trees grow. It is difficult to navigate in these stands due to the dense undergrowth of mountain ash, bird cherry, buckthorn and similar species. The cleanliness of the environment is evidenced by the presence of, among others of Icelandic lung lichen. In some areas, fertile beech forests developed in fertile habitats have survived. Their particularly beautiful fragment near Postolin has been protected since 1962 as a forest and landscape reserve called “Joan’s Hill” with an area of 24.6 ha) common beech on the eastern border of this species range. There is also a mixture of oak, ash, pine and spruce. The highest natural value is characterized by the fertile lowland beech and a fragment of acidic lowland beech forest, the liverwort and the eagle-owl fern [56].Many hiking trails run through the Milickie Forests. Wandering them, however, requires a good map, which becomes necessary with the massive presence of mushroom pickers. The red trail from Żmigród through Sułów to Milicz-Karłów, almost exclusively through the forest, is of great importance. Early autumn is an attractive time of the year, when the beautiful colors of the landscapes are given by the clusters of beech trees. The forests of Milicz are distinguished by the great biodiversity of forest animals. You can meet deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar and many other forest inhabitants [56].", 2. Methodology, 2.1.

196,"Airborne laser scanning (ALS) data were collected in August 2015 using a Riegl LMSQ680i laser scanning system with a pulse frequency of 360 kHz, resulting in point clouds with an average of 10 pulses/m2. The mean flight altitude was 550 m and the field of view of the scanning system was 60 degrees. Together with the point clouds, the data provider created a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m using TerraSolid software. This DTM was used to normalize all yields from the raw point clouds [57].Polygon layers representing the crowns of individual trees (with a given area and height) were used for the analyses and were created for the REMBIOFOR project “Remote sensing for determining wood biomass and carbon stocks in forests”, which was conducted at the Forest Research Institute from 2014–2018. The segmentation method [58] used the CHM and adaptive kernel windows in relation to tree height. Taller trees were smoothed with a larger kernel window and shorter trees were smoothed with smaller kernel windows. In total, three groups of trees were defined with respect to height for coniferous and deciduous tree species. Analysis of the results shows that the method works well for dominant trees in the sample and provides a good accuracy (about 80%) in correctly detecting trees. When segmentation errors occurred, they did not significantly affect the results, as tree canopy cover was the target and not the exact number of trees. The layer of polygons representing individual tree crowns from segmentation is provided with information on their height and crown projection area in the table of attributes.", 2. Methodology, 2.2. Remotely Sensed Data,2
197,"A diagram of the analyses is presented in Figure 2.Geometric parameters of vegetation (height, area of crown projection, minimum complex area) were used to classify the area with forest vegetation. Land use information was not used. The area with forest vegetation was calculated separately for three methods according to the FAO/UN and Kyoto Protocol definition. The results were compared to the reference data and the differences were assessed using statistical metrics.", 2. Methodology, 2.3. Methodology in General,2
198,"For the FAO/UN definition, percentage cover was determined using three different methods, which are described below.The first method is based on a triangular grid such that each point representing a tree is the vertex of one of the triangles. Such a triangular grid can be created using the Delauney triangulation method. Irregular polygons created during a segmentation process were used to represent the individual trees of 5 m and higher. The areas for which percent cover is calculated (“Convex Hull”) were created based on groups of trees (three each) defined by the vertices of the triangles, as shown below. This method was used in the analysis and abbreviated as Method 1 [50,51,52,53] (Figure 3).The second method uses only the polygons representing individual tree crowns from the segmentation [54]. This method was abbreviated as Method 2 (Figure 4).The third method uses only the pixels representing forest vegetation with a height of at least 5 m on Canopy Height Model [27,28,29]. This method was abbreviated as Method 3 (Figure 5).For the Kyoto Protocol definition, the criteria were a minimum height of 2 m, 10% for percentage cover, and 0.1 ha for the area of a forest complex. For the Kyoto Protocol definition, percent cover was calculated in the same way as for the FAO/UN definition described above.At the final stage, the results consist of 6 levels (3 methods times 2 definitions) representing the area covered by forest vegetation for the Milicz study area described in the “Study Area” section. The three methods were summarized in Table 4.", 2. Methodology, 2.4. Methods for Determining the Canopy Coverfrom ALS Data,2
199,"The accuracy of the above methods was verified by manual vectorization performed on a selected set of 270 test plots (10 × 10 m2) and 30 test plots (30 × 30 m2) in the Milicz study area according to the definition formulated by FAO/UN and the Kyoto Protocol.The centre of the test plots was selected from the circular test plots established during the field inventory. The data from the study area—tree height, canopy length and width measured in two directions—helped in vectorization based on the tree canopy height model and orthophotomap. Crown length and width were measured using a simple tape measure. Tree height was measured using the Vertex IV device (Haglof Sweden AB, Langsele, Sweden). Each test plot was classified as forest or no forest based on the height and canopy criteria.An example of the vectorization results is shown in Figure 6. The results can be found in Table 3.", 2.

201,"The study refers to the estimation of the areas of forest vegetation according to the international definitions (height, canopy, area of forest complex). It does not take into account land use and the determination of areas that constitute forests or non-forests, regardless of forest vegetation. The study is based on the level of polygons representing the tree canopy from the segmentation of objects, manual vectorization of the tree canopy model, statistical tests, etc., which have their own accuracy and limitations. Natural forest characteristics may also influence the results. All three methods can be performed using a tree canopy height model and appropriate software, e.g., ArcGIS or QGIS.", 2. Methodology, 2.7. Limitations of the Study,2
202,"Based on the specificity of the methods tested, Method 2 [54] was assumed to be closest to the analysis results using the reference data. Method 1 [50,51,52,53] accounts for the area between the crowns of individual trees that resulted from triangulation, which may result in an overestimation of the area with forest vegetation. Method 3 [27,28,29], on the other hand, does not consider the area of tree crowns below the required threshold, which may lead to an underestimation of the area with forest vegetation.To perform the analysis, a model of tree canopy height with a maximum size of 1m pixel generated from a dense point cloud is required. In addition, the detection of individual trees needs to be mapped. Moreover, tools for data processing and spatial analysis (e.g., QGIS or ArcGIS) are required.", 2. Methodology, 2.8. Assumptions and Boundary Conditions,2
203,"Of the 270 test plots, 181 were a forest according to the FAO/UN definition and 189 according to the UNFCCC definition. Out of 30 test plots, 23 were a forest as per FAO/UN definition and 23 as per UNFCCC definition. The accuracy of the above methods was verified by manual vectorization performed on a selected set of 270 test plots (10 × 10 m2) and 30 test plots (30 × 30 m2) in the Milicz study area according to the definition formulated by FAO/UN and Kyoto Protocol. The results are presented in Table 5.Classification accuracy varied between the Methods; independently of scale (10 m or 30 m) and the definition (FAO/UN or Kyoto), the highest levels of accuracies were obtained for classification by Method 2 and the values of overall accuracy and Kappa were very high (OA > 97%, Kappa > 0.94). It is worth noticing that Method 3 resulted in the same excellent accuracies in the case of 30 test plots per UNFCCC definition. Method 1 turned out to be the worst option and resulted in 83% < OA < 93% and 0.38 < κ <0.79.The area of forest vegetation accuracies are shown in Table 5. On the basis of these results, we can state that among analysed methods, Method 2 was the most accurate one in the case of both definitions, with the values of RMSE% and MAE% less than 3% independently of the grid size (200 m or 30 m). Strong linear correlations between estimated Method 2 values of the area of forest vegetation and reference data were observed (R2 ≈ 0.99, Figure A1, Figure A2, Figure A3, Figure A4, Figure A5, Figure A6, Figure A7, Figure A8, Figure A9, Figure A10, Figure A11 and Figure A12). Additionally, Method 2 resulted in the lowest MBE values (Figure A1, Figure A2, Figure A3, Figure A4, Figure A5, Figure A6, Figure A7, Figure A8, Figure A9, Figure A10, Figure A11 and Figure A12).Inconclusive results were achieved for Method 3. Method 3 resulted in moderate accuracies, with an RMSE% and MAE% less than 20% according to UNFCCC protocol and strong linear correlation ((R2 > 0.96, Figure A1, Figure A2, Figure A3, Figure A4, Figure A5, Figure A6, Figure A7, Figure A8, Figure A9, Figure A10, Figure A11 and Figure A12). Method 3 worked the worst in the case of the second definition (51% ≤ RMSE% ≤ 56%, MAE% ≈ 27%, 0.60 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.64). The values of the measurements underestimate the forest area in case of the FAO definition and they overestimate the forest area due to the Kyoto definition.Conversely, Method 1 provided the largest errors (RMSE% from 68.7% to 97.8% and MAE% from 57.8% to 70.3%). The values of Pearson correlation coefficient for that method varied from 73.5% to 83.7%. High positive values of the MBE means that measurements by Method 1 overestimate the area of forest vegetation (Table 6, Figure A1, Figure A2, Figure A3, Figure A4, Figure A5, Figure A6, Figure A7, Figure A8, Figure A9, Figure A10, Figure A11 and Figure A12).", 3.

204,"The study refers to the estimation of areas of forest vegetation according to the international definitions (height, canopy cover, area of forest complex).

Method 3 resulted in the same excellent accuracies in the case of 30 test plots per UNFCCC definition. Method 1 turned out to be the worst option.There are many approaches to forest area delineation based on remote sensing data. In this paper, we focus on the use of airborne laser scanning data and the estimation of three variables that determine the presence of forest vegetation in the international forest definitions: elevation, crown projection area, and forest complex area, which have not been fully addressed in previous work. In the work, we use three methods for calculating tree canopy cover proposed by: Eysn et al. and Sackov and Kardos [50,51,52,53] (Method 1); Straub et al. [54] (Method 2) and Wang et al. [27,28,29] (Method 3). However, no publication was found comparing the methods used to calculate the degree of canopy cover with each other and with the reference data. Method 2 was the most accurate for both definitions, with values of RMSE% and MAE % of less than 3% regardless of grid size (200 m or 30 m) and a strong linear correlation between the results and the reference data of R2 ≈ 0.99. Method 3 resulted in moderate accuracies, with an RMSE% and MAE% of less than 20% according to the UNFCCC protocol and the linear correlation of R2 > 0.96. Method 1 performed worst in the case of the UNFCCC definition. The accuracy obtained in our study (83.3–100%) is comparable to the accuracy of Haapanen [20]—80–91%, Straub [54]—97.7%, Sackov and Kardos [53]—93%, Pekkarinen [30]—80–90%, Eysn [50,51,52]—96–98.4%, Pujar [36]—76–79%, Kolecka [34]—95% and Naesset [26]—random errors of 1–4.6%.In the case of the FAO/UN definition, Methods 1 and 2 overestimate forest area and Method 3 underestimates it. In the case of the Kyoto Protocol definition, all definitions overestimate the forest area compared to the reference data. This is true for the accuracy analysis of 270 sample plots (100 m2 area). For the analysis of 30 sample plots (900 m2 area), Method 1 overestimates the forest area, and Methods 2 and 3 reach the accuracy limit of 100%.It is worth noting that the minimum area of forest land according to FAO/UN and UNFCCC definitions is 0.1 ha, which is slightly more than the largest sample plots in terms of the area used in our study. It is reasonable to assume that the smaller the scale of the analysis (i.e., the larger the area analyzed), the smaller the differences between the results, which is particularly important when reporting a country-wide forest area.Aerial and satellite imagery, as well as data from airborne laser scanning [38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47], allows for segmentation and thus the creation of polygons representing the crowns of individual trees with a given projected area. It is possible to use multiple aerial images and to obtain the height information using the stereo matching method [59], which creates a three-dimensional data space from the two-dimensional images. Unfortunately, this method is susceptible to illumination conditions and provides less accurate results when there are many shadows on the input images. Airborne laser scanner data is resistant to this problem.For accuracy analysis, a reference in the form of manual vectoring of the areas with forest vegetation on the sample plots, canopy height model and orthophotomap was used and was supported by the individual tree height and canopy data (measured in 4 directions) from the sample plots. Such distance data used to collect reference information can be considered to be a very good and accurate data source. In addition, the reference data were also performed manually by Eysn [50,51,52], Sackov and Kardos [53], Wang [27,28,29], Straub [54]. Kolecka [34] and Pekkarinen [30], who performed the accuracy analysis based on the test points or polygons. Pujar [36] performed only the visual analysis. Finally, we assume that the reference data we used is accurate enough. We can assume that the best option for reference data would be to measure all trees on the sample plots, including height and crown size, measured in 8 directions. This would of course require an incomparably larger amount of work. Nevertheless, we are confident that the reference data used in this study are reliable and often better than those used in other studies of this type.The high cost of analyses over increasingly large areas should also be noted. Since the difference between the results obtained becomes smaller as the area size increases, the method with the lowest processing costs and times should be chosen. The least demanding method in this respect is Method 3 and should be considered as an alternative when analyzing large areas, as it has a similar accuracy to Method 2.In this paper, for the first time, methods for determining the area for which canopy cover is calculated (using data from (ALS) are compared and the differences between them in terms of accuracy (the agreement between the results and the reference data) and the complexity of the process (time and effort required to perform the analysis) are discussed. The area with forest vegetation is a starting point for the assessment of forest area according to the international definitions, taking into account land use and its future evolution, even without the current forest vegetation. This in turn is important in the context of reporting, estimating carbon stocks and biodiversity to mitigate the effects of climate change.International organizations such as the FAO/UN and the UNFCCC require signatory countries to maintain and increase the area of forests and other areas with forest vegetation. The methodology proposed in this article can help monitor afforestation with a similar and objective methodology. Forests play an important role in the accumulation of carbon stocks, the release of which into the atmosphere would increase the negative effects of climate change. In addition, forests are important for biodiversity, provide environmental services and influence quality of life and health [60,61]. Therefore, by using good forest monitoring methods, we are not only improving this tool, but also solving many other problems that contribute to the management and protection of forests. Above all, however, we are helping to create a forestry policy based on a consistent, objective and uniform methodology.", 4. Discussion,None,4
205,"This paper is the first to compare three consistent, objective, and uniform methods for defining the area for which canopy cover is calculated (using ALS data) to define forest area. Two forest definitions were used: UNFCCC and Kyoto, and analyses were conducted at different spatial scales. Differences between the methods used were discussed in terms of accuracy (agreement of results with reference data) and complexity of the process (time and effort required to perform the analysis).Of the methods tested, Method 2 proved to be the most accurate for both definitions (UNFCCC and Kyoto). Strong linear correlations were found between the values of the forest vegetation area estimated by Method 2 and the reference data. Method 1 was found to be the worst option. Method 1 contained the largest errors and overestimated the forest vegetation area.The complexity of the methods was related to the need to invest more time and equipment in their implementation. Since the difference between the results of the different methods becomes smaller as the size of the analyzed area increases, the method with the least effort for its implementation should be chosen. The least demanding method in this respect is Method 3, which should be considered as an alternative for large-scale analyses due to its similar accuracy to Method 2.The results obtained are important for the management and protection of forest areas. Accurate and efficient estimation of forest area is important for reporting, carbon stock estimation, forest conservation and management, afforestation monitoring and biodiversity monitoring for climate change mitigation.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
206,"Water use efficiency (WUE) is the ratio of carbon gain (or gross primary production, GPP) to water consumption (or evapotranspiration, ET). As an important indicator of the coupling between the carbon and water cycles, WUE closely links biological processes (e.g., photosynthesis, transpiration) with physical processes (e.g., evaporation) [1,2]. WUE measures the tradeoff between carbon uptake and water consumption of terrestrial ecosystems, and is an important indicator for understanding the responses of terrestrial ecosystems to climate change [3].Ecosystem WUE is influenced by many biological and abiotic factors. For example, a previous study based on eddy covariance data [4] suggested that forest WUE increased because of the elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations while this hypothesis was challenged by a recent study [5] based on 30-year tree ring records of carbon and oxygen isotope measurements, basal area increment, and eddy covariance measurements. This new study [5] disentangled the relative effects of photosynthesis and stomatal conductance on rising forest WUE, and found that rising forest WUE was mainly due to enhanced photosynthesis and partly due to reductions in stomatal conductance. WUE also decreased with the increase of elevation and solar radiation and increased with temperature, precipitation, and leaf area index (LAI) [6]. Moreover, WUE varies with vegetation type. For example, a previous study showed that the WUE of deciduous broad forests was higher than that of evergreen needle forests; stomatal conductance mainly controlled the increase of WUE in deciduous broad forests while the increase of GPP led to the increase of WUE in evergreen needle forests [7]. In addition, WUE is affected by drought, and the responses of WUE to water stress vary over space. For example, Liu et al. [8] found that drought generally reduced WUE in central China but increased WUE in central Inner Mongolia and Northeast China. Guo et al. [9] found that the WUE increased in Northeast China, Northeast Inner Mongolia, and some regions with abundant forests in South China, and declined in Northwest and Central China during drought periods.Drought has become one of the main obstacles to the health of ecosystems by reducing soil water availability and plant carbon uptake [10,11]. With the acceleration of global climate change, the frequency and intensity of drought have been increasing regionally and globally [12,13,14,15]. Drought can limit plant growth and lead to forests fires, crop yield reduction, land degradation, and biological invasion [3,16,17]. Meanwhile, drought can reduce plant transpiration and disturb the global water balance [18]. Up to now, the impact of drought on ecosystem WUE has received growing attention in scientific research [19,20,21,22,23,24,25]. A previous study found that annual WUE decreased in moderate and extreme drought but slightly increased in severe drought [8]. In addition, Yang et al. [10] found that drought increased WUE in arid areas and decreased WUE in semi-arid and sub-humid areas, and different ecosystems had different sensitivity to the changes of hydrological and climatic conditions. However, another study showed that the global WUE had a negative response to drought in arid areas while it had both positive and negative responses in humid areas [26]. Li et al. [27] found that the 2009–2010 drought in Southwest China inhibited the growth of vegetation in Yunnan, northern Guangxi, Guizhou, and eastern Sichuan and led to the decline of primary productivity and carbon uptake. Although the effects of drought on WUE have been well studied [28,29], it remains unclear how the responses of WUE vary with drought severity.In this study, we examined the responses of WUE to drought in Southwest China from 2000 to 2017 using the scPDSI (Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index) [30] and MODIS (Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) GPP and ET data. Southwest China has experienced frequent droughts and provides a test bed for studying the responses of WUE to drought. We examined the spatial and temporal variations of drought, and analyzed how the responses of WUE to drought varied with vegetation type and drought severity. Our results can help us better understand the responses and adaptability of ecosystems to drought.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
207,"Southwest China (97.5–110.2°E, 21.1–34.3°N) is mainly composed of Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces, and the total land area is 1,138,700 km2. The natural divisions mainly consist of the Sichuan Basin, Western Sichuan Plateau, Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, and the west of Liang-Guang Hills. The main vegetation types of Southwest China are forests, shrublands, grasslands, and croplands (mainly including rice, corn, rape, flue-cured tobacco), which account for 18.87%, 16.83%, 22.25%, and 25.16% of the land area, respectively. Croplands are mainly distributed in the Sichuan Basin and Zhong-Shan hilly area of Guizhou province; the high-elevation areas, such as the western Sichuan Plateau, are mainly covered by grasslands; most of southern Sichuan and Yunnan are dominated by forests (Figure 1a).Southwest China is characterized by a large elevation gradient: The elevation of the Sichuan Basin and its surrounding areas as well as eastern Guizhou is less than 1000 m; the elevation of southern Sichuan and Northwest Yunnan is between 1000 and 2000 m; and the elevation of the western Sichuan Plateau is above 3500 m (Figure 1b). Air temperature and precipitation exhibit large variations across the region. The annual mean temperature is higher than 10 °C in the eastern region and is lower than 0 °C in the western Sichuan Plateau (Figure 1c). The annual precipitation is relatively high (>1000 mm) in the eastern and southern regions and much lower in the central and northern regions (Figure 1d).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area,2
208,"The data used in this study mainly include climate, remote sensing (GPP, ET, and land cover), drought index, and digital elevation model (DEM). The specific data sets and detailed information on the data are provided in Table 1.The monthly temperature and precipitation datasets for the period 2000–2017 were obtained from the China Meteorological Data Service Center (http://data.cma.cn/). For each grid cell across Southwest China, the monthly station records were aggregated annually to calculate annual temperature and annual precipitation for each year over the study period. We also calculated the mean annual temperature (MAT) and mean annual precipitation (MAP).The land cover data with a spatial resolution of 1 km obtained from the Data Center of Resources and Environmental Sciences (http://www.resdc.cn/Default.aspx) was used to identify the vegetation type of each grid cell. The four broad vegetation types examined in this study are forests, shrublands, grasslands, and croplands.The monthly MODIS GPP [31,32] and ET [33,34] data (with a 1-km resolution) during the period 2000–2017 were both obtained from University of Montana (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu). The reliability and accuracy of the GPP product (MOD17A2) have been evaluated by many previous studies [35,36,37,38,39], and it has been compared with ground-based data from various terrestrial ecosystems [32,35]. The ET product (MOD16A2) is based on meteorological reanalysis data and vegetation attributes [34,40], and has been evaluated with flux tower data from the United States [40,41], Asia [42], and other regions.The global monthly Self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) with a 0.5°-spatial resolution was obtained from the Climatic Research Unit (https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/drought/). This drought index was used to analyze the drought conditions and the influences of drought on WUE during the period from 2000 to 2017. The scPDSI metric [30] was proposed based on the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI) [43], and the scPDSI is more comparable across different climate regimes than the traditional Palmer drought severity index (PSDI). The scPDSI was calculated from monthly precipitation and air temperature data at each location. The values of scPDSI range from −5.0 to 5.0, which indicates drought to humid conditions. Following Wang et al. [44], the wet or dry conditions are divided into three categories: Drought (scPDSI ≤ −1), normal (−1 < scPDSI < 1), and humid (1 ≤ scPDSI), while the drought category can be further divided into slight drought, moderate drought, severe drought, and extreme drought (Table 2).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Datasets,2
209,"For each grid cell in the study region, we calculated annual GPP and ET from the monthly GPP and ET, respectively, for each year over the period 2000–2017. We then calculated annual WUE for each grid cell over the 18-year period from annual GPP and ET. The ecosystem WUE (gC kg−1H2O) of an ecosystem can be expressed as follows [45]:

WUE = GPP/ET


(1)


where WUE, GPP, and ET are the annual WUE, GPP, and ET, respectively.In this study, the proportion of the pixels affected by drought in Southwest China was used to measure the spatial extent of drought across the region. To assess the temporal variations in WUE and scPDSI, the linear trends of per-pixel annual WUE and scPDSI over the period 2000–2017 were calculated by using the ordinary least square regression (OLSR) method. For each grid cell, the trend was considered to be statistically significant if the p value was less than 0.05. The grid cells with missing values were excluded in our analysis.In order to compare and analyze the effects of drought on WUE, we calculated the difference of annual WUE (∆WUE) between the drought year and the normal year in the same region. If ∆WUE values are greater than 0, WUE exhibits positive anomalies and drought likely increases WUE; if ∆WUE values are less than 0, WUE shows negative anomalies and drought likely decreases WUE. The nonlinear correlation analysis was used to study the responses of annual WUE to drought.The trend of scPDSI from 2000 to 2017 was calculated with the Mann–Kendall (M-K) method, following [46,47]. The M-K test does not require that samples follow a certain distribution, and it is also insensitive to outliers. This method is suitable for data with a non-normal distribution (e.g., hydrological and meteorological data). Many previous studies used the M-K method to analyze the trend in time series of precipitation, temperature, runoff, and water quality [48,49].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Analysis,2
210,"The total land area affected by drought in Southwest China showed large interannual variations from 2000 to 2017 (Figure 2a). Overall, the drought area accounted for nearly half of the total land area in 2006. During the period 2010–2013, the drought area exceeded 55% of the entire region for four consecutive years. After 2013, the drought area substantially decreased due to the alleviation of drought. The drought area for the four broad vegetation types showed generally similar interannual variations (Figure 2b). The severe drought and extreme drought occurred in the region in 2006 and 2010 were also reported in the literature [8,27]. We used the proportion of the drought area in Southwest China to measure the spatial extent of drought, and selected 2006 and 2010 as two drought years for further analysis.The spatial distribution, the frequency of drought (scPDSI < −1), and the trend of scPDSI from 2000 to 2017 are shown in Figure 3. On average, most parts of Southwest China were characterized by “normal” or slight drought categories (Figure 3a). The frequency of drought was relatively high in Southwestern Yunnan and central Sichuan (Figure 3b). During the 18-year period, drought occurred more than 10 times for many areas in Southwest China. The Sichuan Basin and the junction of Sichuan and Yunnan were relatively humid with low drought frequency (0–5 times). Figure 3c showed the scPDSI trend from 2000 to 2017 calculated with the M-K method. The scPDSI in the Sichuan Basin showed a significant increasing trend from 2000 to 2017, indicating that this region exhibited a wetting trend. By contrast, the scPDSI showed a significant decreasing trend in Northwest Yunnan and Southwest Sichuan, indicating a drying trend in this region.", 3. Results, 3.1. Spatial and Temporal Variations of Drought in Southwest China,3
211,"The annual WUE of the terrestrial ecosystems in Southwest China fluctuated greatly from 2000 to 2017 with a multi-year mean value of 1.70 gC kg−1H2O (Figure 4a). Over the entire study period 2000–2017, the annual WUE generally showed a decreasing trend that was statistically insignificant except for croplands (Figure 4a–e). With the start (2000) and end (2017) years with particularly low WUE values excluded, the trends of WUE were statistically significant for all vegetated grid cells (Figure 4a) and croplands (Figure 4e). Moreover, WUE also exhibited a declining trend for each of the four main vegetation types (Figure 4b–e). In addition, the mean annual WUE differed among vegetation types: Forests had the largest WUE (3.25 gC kg−1H2O), followed by shrublands (2.00 gC kg−1H2O), croplands (1.76 gC kg−1H2O), and grasslands (1.04 gC kg−1H2O) (Figure 4b–e).The annual WUE was relatively high in Yunnan, southern Sichuan, and Southwestern Sichuan Basin and relatively low in the Western Sichuan Plateau and Guizhou (Figure 5a). The WUE trends based on the Mann–Kendall method were divided into three categories: Significant increase (slope > 0, p < 0.05), no significant trend (p < 0.5), and significant decrease (slope < 0, p < 0.05) [49]. The WUE trends from the Mann–Kendall method are shown in Figure 5b. From 2000 to 2017, most vegetated grid cells in the study region had no significant trends; The annual WUE in the Sichuan Basin and northern Sichuan showed significant decreases while the annual WUE in the Northwest, Northeast, and eastern Yunnan significantly increased. From Figure 3b and Figure 5b, it can be found that the areas with significant increases in scPDSI (drought relief or wetting) were generally consistent with those areas with significant decreases in WUE; the areas with significant decreases in scPDSI (drying or drought aggravation) were generally consistent with those areas with significant increases in WUE. Therefore, drought had an enhancement effect on WUE over Southwest China.", 3. Results, 3.2. Spatial and Temporal Variations of WUE in Southwest China,3
212,"The spatially averaged mean annual WUE values under different wet or dry conditions are shown in Figure 6. The mean annual WUE averaged over all vegetated grid cells increased as the wet or dry conditions changed from moderate humid to moderate drought. The mean annual WUE of forests and shrublands generally increased with the wet or dry conditions changing from humid to drought, and reached their peak values (2.43 and 2.13 gC kg−1H2O, respectively) in moderate drought. The grasslands were more sensitive to drought with WUE increased to the peak value (1.2 gC kg−1H2O) under slight drought. The WUE of croplands was the highest for the slight humid category and then decreased as the wet or dry conditions changed from slight humid to moderate drought.The percentage of drought area (scPDSI < −1) was used to identify drought years (Figure 2a). We selected two drought years, 2006 and 2010, for further analysis. The average data of the study period 2000–2017, excluding the two identified drought years (2006 and 2010), were used as the normal year. The ∆WUE was used to study the impacts of drought on ecosystem WUE. Although the spatial distributions of WUE in 2006, 2010, and the normal year were generally similar (Figure 7), the WUE anomalies for 2006 (∆WUE2006) and 2010 (∆WUE2010) showed positive and negative values (Figure 8). ∆WUE2006 and ∆WUE2010 generally had opposite values in the Sichuan Basin, southwestern Yunnan, and Guizhou Province (Figure 8). The effects of drought on WUE were also different for different vegetation types (Table 3). In 2006, WUE increased for 55.3%, 70.2%, 79.1%, and 80.9% of the grid cells covered by forests, shrublands, grasslands, and croplands, respectively, and increased for more than 70% of all the vegetated grid cells for the whole region. In 2010, WUE increased for more grid cells for forests and grasslands and decreased for more grid cells for croplands.The areas with severe drought in 2006 and 2010 (Figure 8) were selected to further analyze the impacts of drought on ecosystem WUE. In 2006, southwestern Yunnan was selected as a typical region of drought occurrence. In this area, the scPDSI was mostly negatively correlated with WUE because the moderate and severe drought (−4 < scPDSI < −2) enhanced WUE (Figure 9a,c). In 2010, the WUE in the area highlighted in Figure 8b showed a quadratic correlation with scPDSI and a peak value was observed because the extreme drought (−5 < scPDSI < −4) reduced WUE (Figure 9b).We further explored the responses of ecosystem WUE to drought at the monthly timescale for different vegetation types (Figure 10). The monthly WUE of both forests and shrublands increased first and then decreased with the aggravation of drought, and the inflection points of WUE were −3.4 and −3.2 for scPDSI, respectively. However, no inflection points in monthly WUE were found for grasslands and croplands. The monthly WUE of grasslands and croplands linearly and nonlinearly decreased with increasing drought severity, respectively.The responses of ecosystem WUE to water status at the monthly timescale may be affected by different plant growth periods. Therefore, we also examined how annual WUE changed with scPDSI (Figure 11). The relationship between WUE and scPDSI at the annual timescale also varied among vegetation types. For forests, shrublands, and croplands, annual WUE showed a pattern of increasing first and then decreasing with the decrease of scPDSI. For grasslands, annual WUE decreased first and then increased with the decrease of scPDSI. In addition, forests showed relatively strong adaptability to drought as annual WUE was relatively stable under moderate drought; the WUE of shrublands was sensitive to drought, and it reached the peak value when scPDSI was near 0; the WUE of grasslands and croplands were also sensitive to wet or dry conditions; and the valley/peak value of WUE was reached when scPDSI was −0.5 to 0.The patterns of annual WUE with changing scPDSI depended on the responses of annual GPP and ET to scPDSI (Figure 11). GPP and ET had different patterns with the changes in scPDSI. For example, with the decrease of scPDSI, GPP showed the pattern of first increasing and then decreasing, while ET continued to slowly decrease. For all the four broad vegetation types, the variations of annual GPP with scPDSI were generally similar to those of annual WUE. Therefore, the variations in annual WUE with changing wet or dry conditions were mainly caused by the variations in annual GPP.", 3. Results, 3.3. Responses of WUE to Drought in Southwest China,3
213,"Many studies have examined the effects of drought on WUE. Some researchers believed that drought could lead to a significant increase in the WUE of natural ecosystems [24,50] while others suggested that drought could reduce the WUE of most ecosystems [51,52]. The responses of water and the carbon cycle to drought in the terrestrial ecosystem are affected by many biological and abiotic factors. Previous studies have pointed out that the WUE had a significant intrinsic variability and plasticity, which may be caused by inheritance [53]. For example, C4 plants generally have a stronger water use ability than C3 plants [54]. The long-term living environment will affect the adaptability of plants to drought. Some plants living in arid regions have a high drought tolerance gene [55], which can improve their resistance to drought stress; some plants (e.g., cactus) increase their resistance to drought stress through metamorphic leaves [56]. In wet areas, high temperature and high evaporation can lead to the decline of WUE while for plants in alpine areas, the WUE is often relatively low because of the high wind speed and solar radiation [50].Our study shows that overall, drought slightly increased the WUE of most forest, grassland, and shrubland ecosystems while there were turning points when drought became more severe. The increase in the WUE suggests that under certain water stress, plants can achieve higher productivity with the same amount of water lost to ET or the same productivity with lower ET; when the degree of water stress exceeds the ability of plant self-regulation, however, drought will reduce the normal physiological metabolism level of plants [57]. Moreover, drought has different inhibition points on WUE for different vegetation types. On the whole, croplands had the lowest resistance to drought, which is also related to the vulnerability and higher productivity of these ecosystems. Therefore, croplands could require higher stability of water availability, and mild drought can cause fluctuations of WUE. The WUE of grasslands was also sensitive to drought, and moderate drought (scPDSI = −3 to −2) could reduce ecosystem WUE. This is consistent with previous research results [58], which found that grasslands can maintain the normal water metabolic demand through root extension under mild drought, and improve WUE by controlling transpiration. The grass root system is relatively shallow, and its drought mediation ability is limited, and more serious water deficit could lead to the decline of grasslands productivity and WUE. The forests and shrublands in Southwest China are dominated by perennial deciduous and evergreen forests that have deeper roots and stronger ability to utilize groundwater; therefore, short-term drought or mild drought could enhance the WUE of forests and shrublands while more severe or long-term drought could decrease WUE.The responses of WUE to drought varied with region, season, and vegetation type. The drought areas in 2010 were characterized by mixed areas of croplands, grasslands, and forests, but the proportion of croplands was relatively large. With the increase of drought intensity, WUE exhibited a significant quadratic curve pattern (Figure 9b), which is different from the overall analysis results that drought led to the decline of WUE in croplands (Figure 6 and Figure 10d). However, WUE and scPDSI showed a negative correlation (WUE decreased due to drought) from January to June (early and middle growth period) and positive correlation (drought enhanced WUE) during July to August (mature period). In the early stage of crop growth (e.g., the jointing stage of corn, the heading stage of rice, the flourishing and long term of flue-cured tobacco), the cropland growth is faster and is sensitive to water demand, and therefore the water deficit leads to a serious decline in productivity and WUE. During July to August (the maturity stage of crops), the plants mainly accumulate dry materials through photosynthesis; as the roots of crops are well developed, the absorption capacity of roots to soil effective water is the strongest, and the high ground canopy coverage can also effectively inhibit soil evaporation; thus, the ecosystem WUE of croplands is relatively high. GPP and ET are two components that directly influence the change of ecosystem WUE [59,60,61]. The different sensitivity of ecosystem GPP and ET to drought results in different responses of WUE to drought. It has been reported that the ecosystem WUE increased under drought stress because the decrease of GPP was less than that of ET [62]. Contrary to some previous studies [63], our results showed that the relationships between WUE and drought varied with vegetation type in Southwest China, indicating the different sensitivity of different vegetation types to drought.The responses of WUE to water deficit during drought has been reported in previous studies, but few studies have been conducted on the changes of WUE after the end of persistent drought events [64,65]. Studying the responses of WUE following drought can help us understand the ability of different ecosystems to recover after drought and to cope with another drought [66]. Vegetation has lagged responses to environmental factors, such as rainfall and temperature, and ecosystem WUE also has lagged responses to drought [8]. During the drought stress period, the drought in the previous year and current year both affected the WUE of terrestrial ecosystems (forests, shrublands, grasslands, and croplands). The regionally averaged WUE had a stronger correlation with drought in the previous year than with drought in the current year (Table 4). This indicates that the drought in the previous year could have larger effects on ecosystem WUE than drought stress in the current year. After drought stress, WUE in the current year was more closely related to the current-year drought than to the previous-year drought. Therefore, the lag effect of drought was not obvious under normal water conditions [67,68].The differences of ecosystem WUE under different drought conditions found in this study were consistent with previous results [69]. The spatial differences of WUE were mainly determined by the environmental factors and the heterogeneity of physiological characteristics among plant species [6]. In addition, the drought resistance of ecosystems depends on various factors, such as drought severity, drought duration, drought extent, vegetation type, plant growth rate, and inter-species competition, and scale differences in drought observation. The stability of ecosystems is related to not only the resistance of plants to water stress but also the recovery of plants (i.e., resilience) [70]. Our results showed that croplands had a weak resistance to drought. Usually, croplands under a water deficit would reduce photosynthesis and aboveground biomass and increase underground biomass, and this is also a survival strategy of ecosystems in arid and semi-arid areas. After severe drought, an ecosystem needs a recovery period [71]. If another drought occurs, the recovered ecosystem can respond quickly and to some extent ensure the stability of the ecosystem WUE level [9]. The resilience of ecosystem WUE found in this study is consistent with previous studies [26,69]. To some extent, ecosystems can adapt to changing hydro-climatic conditions by adjusting its WUE, and after drought, ecosystems can restore their pre-drought status through self-regulation with improved soil water availability [72].", 4. Discussion,None,4
214,"We analyzed the temporal and spatial patterns of WUE and its responses to drought in Southwest China using the MODIS data products (GPP and ET) and the scPDSI drought index. From 2000 to 2017, the mean annual WUE differed among broad vegetation types, with forests having the largest WUE (3.25 gC kg−1H2O), followed by shrublands (2.00 gC kg−1H2O), croplands (1.76 gC kg−1H2O), and grasslands (1.04 gC kg−1H2O). Annual WUE was higher in the Sichuan basin and Yunnan and lower in Guizhou and western Sichuan Plateau. Annual WUE showed a gradual downward trend from 2000 to 2017. The WUE was sensitive to drought, and overall, drought had an enhancement effect on WUE. However, the responses of WUE to drought varied with vegetation type and drought severity. WUE was the most sensitive to drought over croplands, and a slight water deficit was likely to reduce cropland WUE. The drought resistance of grasslands was relatively weak because of its shallow root system; mild drought could increase its WUE while moderate and severe drought could reduce its WUE. The adaptability of forests and shrublands to drought was relatively strong; moderate drought could increase their WUE, and only severe drought could reduce their WUE. Our findings can help us better understand plant water use strategy and inform ecosystem water management.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
215,"Gross primary productivity (GPP), defined as the total photosynthetic carbon uptake by terrestrial plants, is the first phase of atmospheric CO2 reaching the biosphere [1,2]. Currently, farmland accounts for ~12% of the Earth’s land surface [3], and around 15% of global CO2 fixation is contributed by crop GPP [4]. Therefore, accurately quantifying crop GPP can provide valuable information on the ecosystem’s carbon cycle, agricultural applications and climate change [5].For assessing GPP in crops, eddy covariance (EC) systems, satellite-driven methods, and process-based models are frequently employed. Among these, the EC technique allows the direct and continuous monitoring of land–atmosphere net ecosystem exchange (NEE) [6]. The gathered NEE data are routinely partitioned into GPP and ecosystem respiration [7]. However, these EC measurements only represent the fluxes at the scale of the tower footprint, with an along-wind extent ranging between hundreds of meters and several kilometers [8]. Although over 600 EC flux towers are currently in operation around the world, their point-based measurements are insufficient to cover continuous regions in space [9].To deal with the problem of spatial discontinuity in the EC technique, satellite remote sensing, light use efficiency models and process-oriented land surface models are adopted [6]. However, remote sensing-based GPP may not fully guarantee the accuracy of data. For instance, Wang et al. [2] assessed the latest Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) GPP product (MOD17A2H) in different biome types compared with global EC flux-estimated GPP and found that MOD17A2H GPP performed poorly at both annual (coefficient of determination: 0.62) and 8-day scales (coefficient of determination: 0.52). Thus, a more advanced calibration model is required for large-scale applications [10]. Process-based land surface models (e.g., Community Land Model [11] and Simple Biosphere Model 2 [12]) have been designed for cropland GPP, but are subject to complicated scientific assumptions and model parameters [13].GPP in crops is a complicated non-linear function due to the spatial heterogeneity of vegetation and soil properties, and the temporal heterogeneity of the environmental factors (meteorological conditions and agricultural managements) [9,11]. Currently, data-driven machine learning algorithms constitute another popular method for predicting GPP, because they can elucidate precisely nonlinear processes of CO2 exchanges in agroecosystems [14]. Although, in principle, they are black-box models, machine learning methods (e.g., model tree ensembles [15], support vector machines [13], and neural network models [16,17], random forest models [18,19,20,21]) have good performance for multi-ecosystem GPP estimations. For instance, Tramontana et al. [22] quantified the 8-day GPP and the mean European annual carbon budget across ecosystems (e.g., forest, grassland, cropland and wetland) by using a random forest (RF) algorithm, remote sensing and EC data. Recently, an RF model was also adopted to upscale the EC-based GPP to regional scales in an arid and semi-arid area in Northwestern China [23]. Previous studies have evaluated the latest MOD17A2H GPP product across various ecosystems (e.g., forests and grasslands) with global EC data [1,2]. However, the validation has rarely been performed for double-cropping agriculture, especially in rice–wheat-rotation cropland, which is the most extensive land cover type in the northern Yangtze River Delta (NYRD) region, China [24]. Furthermore, the existing studies on the GPP changes in the NYRD mainly focused on the temporal characteristics of carbon exchanges [25,26,27], leaving a knowledge gap with respect to the upscaling of GPP and the calibration of the MOD17A2H GPP product.Therefore, a random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm for GPP (GPPRF) was developed for rice–wheat double-cropping fields by integrating multi-source satellite remote sensing images as well as ground measurements. Based on the above data, the main objectives were to: (1) assess the performance of the MODIS GPP product (GPPMOD) through comparison with EC-estimated GPP (GPPEC) and determine the driving factors of GPP; (2) extrapolate the GPP from the single-site scale to multi-site scales; and (3) calibrate the GPPMOD over the rice–wheat-rotation cropland in the NYRD.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
216,"The NYRD is composed of the northern Anhui and Jiangsu provinces and Shanghai, ranging between 114° and 122°E and 29° and 36°N (Figure 1). The NYRD covers an area of 176,960 km2, consisting of 73% cropland, 16% grassland, 5% built-up land, 4% water bodies, and 2% forest (Figure 1). Three EC flux sites were representative of typical rice–wheat-rotation cropland landscapes found in this cropland (Figure 1, inset map) [24,25]. The soil pH value (H2O), soil organic carbon and soil total nitrogen in topsoil (0–0.3 cm) for our study area mainly ranged between 5.5 and 7.2, 1.2, 2, 0.1 and 0.15%, respectively, according to the results of Wei et al. [28]. Here, the winter wheat grows from November to late May. At the beginning of June, the rice paddies are flooded, plowed and harrowed to incorporate the wheat straw residue from the last wheat growing season [29]. Then, one-month-old rice seedlings are transplanted to the leveled field in mid-June and harvested in early November (Figure 2a), which can be indicated by the seasonal dynamics of the 8-day leaf area index (LAI) averaged from 23 weather stations and 3 EC stations during the period of 2014–2018 (Figure 2b). The rice/wheat canopy height can reach about 1–1.2 m at the peak LAI growing seasons. The local climate is sub-tropical monsoon-type, with a mean annual (2014–2018, calculated from the 23 surface meteorological stations in Figure 1) air temperature of 16 °C and rainfall of 1100 mm."," 2.

Eddy Covariance Flux DataFlux data from three rice–wheat-rotation cropland EC stations within the study area—the Shouxian site in Anhui and the Dongtai and Dafeng sites in Jiangsu—were selected for model training and prediction (Figure 1). At the Shouxian site, the EC sensors were mounted 2.5 m above the ground and consisted of a three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) along with a CO2/H2O open-path infrared gas analyzer (EC 150, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA). At the Dongtai and Dafeng sites, virtual temperature and wind velocity components were monitored using a three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT, USA). To measure H2O and CO2 density, a fast response open path gas analyzer (LI-7500, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) was used. The installation height of the sensors for the Dongtai site was 10 m, whereas for the Dafeng site it was 6.3 m above the ground. As mentioned in the previous studies ([26,27,29]), the three EC sites are relatively flat, with more than 90% of the flux primarily contributed by the cropland. EddyPro 5.2.1 (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA, 2015) software was applied to calculate hourly CO2 fluxes and to correct for CO2 canopy storage to obtain NEE values. Data pre-processing in the EddyPro software mainly included averaging and statistical tests [30], time lag compensation, double coordinate rotation, spectral correction [31], and Webb–Pearman–Leuning density correction [32].

Firstly, a quality-check and filtering were performed based on the relationship between observed flux and friction velocity to discard biased data [34]. Then, the flux data were gap-filled using the marginal distribution sampling approach [35]. NEE was separated into GPP and ecosystem respiration based on the nighttime partitioning algorithms [35]. The gap-filled hourly GPP data were summed to compute cumulative GPP for daily, 8 day, seasonal and annual time resolution for further analysis [36].

221,"RF is a fast and flexible machine learning algorithm, which is often used for analyzing the classification and regression tasks [42]. This model can successfully process highly dimensional and multicollinear data, being insensitive to overfitting [43]. The RF model provides a feature-selection tool to identify the importance of the predictor. Feature importance is defined as the contribution of each variable to the model, with important variables showing a greater impact on the model evaluation results [44]. In this section, a GPP prediction model based on RF framework was proposed. The flowchart of estimating and upscaling GPP and calibrating the MOD17A2H GPP product with the RF model is shown in Figure 3, including four steps as follows:(1)Variable selection and data matching. Crop photosynthesis is a complicated process affected by shortwave radiation, air temperature, vapor pressure deficit, soil edaphoclimatic conditions and fertilization at the canopy scale, etc. Meanwhile, at the ecosystem level, GPP is closely related to light, water and canopy phenology [23,45]. Based on the previous literature as well as our current available data, nine input explanatory variables, NDVI, LAI, FPAR, DSR, daily maximum air temperature (Tmax), daily minimum air temperature (Tmin), daily mean air temperature (Tmean), VPD, and RH, were chosen for predicting the GPP dynamics in the NYRD region. As RF model training requires a large number of samples, MODIS data were linearly interpolated from 8-day/16-day to daily values to match the input parameters, following a previous study by Reitz et al. [19].(2)RF model construction, training and testing. In this paper, 90% (the rest 10%) of the EC data at Shouxian and Dongtai during the entire observation period were employed to train (validate) the RF model, and 100% of the EC data at Dafeng were applied to validate the model. The Shouxian and the Dafeng sites were independent of each other with a negligible autocorrelation between them, as these sites are about 300–400 km far away from each other (Figure 1). Here, a 10-fold cross-validation (CV) algorithm was applied to weaken the overfitting [20]. In 10-fold CV experiments, all the training data at the Shouxian and Dongtai sites during the entire observation period were randomly partitioned into ten equal-sized subsamples. Of the ten subsamples, nine subsamples were used as the training data and the remaining one was the testing data. This CV process was repeated ten times, with all ten subsamples used exactly once as the testing data. The ten results from the folds were averaged to produce a single estimation. To select the best model, we adjusted the four hyperparameters of the RF model based on Bayesian optimization [46,47]: the number of trees to grow (n_estimators), the minimum sample number placed in a node prior to the node being split (msplit), maximum number of features considers to split a node (Mfeatures), and the maximum number of levels in each decision tree (Mdepth). Three statistical metrics—the index of agreement (IA) [48], the coefficient of determination (R2), and the root mean square error (RMSE)—were used to examine the simulated performance of the 10-fold CV results. The range of IA is 0–1, and a better correspondence between the observed and modeled results often occurs when it approaches 1 [49]. Therefore, n_estimators = 219, msplit = 2, Mfeatures = 9, and Mdepth = 32 were set for the final RF model.(3)GPP upscaling. The general relationships between GPPRF and explanatory data were first trained at site level, and then applied regionally by using regional surface meteorological stations of explanatory variables as follows: GPPRF VS f (Tmax, Tmin, Tmean, VPD, RH, NDVI, LAI, FPAR, DSR).(4)MOD17A2H GPP product calibration. Based on the upscaled results of GPPRF and GPPMOD at the station scale, a relationship between GPPRF and GPPMOD was built. The calibration function was then applied from the site scale to the regional scale."," 2. Study Area, Data and Methods", 2.3. Methods,2
222,"MOD17A2H GPP has been extensively employed to evaluate the terrestrial carbon balance [1]. However, to have confidence in GPPMOD, it is critical to validate it against in situ measurements [49]. As shown in Figure 4a–c, the 8-day GPPMOD and GPPEC exhibit close agreement in their seasonal patterns, with peaks in July (May) for the rice (wheat) growing seasons across the three rice–wheat-rotation cropland sites. The GPP increases during the no-planting period in 2017 (Figure 4a), mainly due to weed photosynthesis. GPPMOD underestimated GPPEC during the rice (wheat) active growing periods from July to September (from March to May), with IA = 0.56 and RMSE = 47 g C m−2 (IA = 0.61 and RMSE = 29 g C m−2) across the three sites. However, GPPMOD performed well during the intercropping periods from late May to early June (or late November), with IA = 0.77 and RMSE = 8 g C m−2 across the three sites.The seasonal cumulative GPPEC at the three cropland sites was larger for the summer rice growing seasons (1170, 1066, and 889 g C m−2 for Shouxian, Dongtai and Dafeng, respectively) than for wheat (609, 848 and 701 g C m−2, respectively) (Figure 4d–f). The seasonal cumulative GPPMOD was significantly lower than GPPEC during the wheat growth seasons, with a 32–47% underestimation of the seasonal cumulative GPPEC at the three sites; the seasonal average GPPMOD was 27–47% lower than the seasonal cumulative GPP during the summer rice growth seasons (Figure 4d–f).

223,"The possible drivers related to the GPP variations in the NYRD are investigated by the RF model in Figure 5 to assess their relative contributions. NDVI was the most important factor in modulating GPP, accounting for 56% of the overall variable importance. As illustrated in Figure 6, GPP showed the strongest positive correlation with NDVI, with the highest Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of 0.74, which was consistent with the variable importance value in Figure 5. In addition to NDVI, there were another three dominant variables—namely, LAI, DSR, Tmax and FPAR, with importance values of 13%, 10%, 8% and 3%, respectively. NDVI and LAI were important indicators of the phase of terrestrial photosynthesis, which tracked well the crop phenological dynamics over time [22,48,50]. DSR and FPAR covaried with light to a large degree—the source of energy for photosynthesis in vegetation [51]. Tmax played a critical role in the chemical reactions of biological processes [17]. In contrast, the impact of Tmean, Tmin, VPD and RH on GPP was not obvious, exhibiting the lowest relative importance, with values of 2, 2, 2 and 2%, respectively. Although FPAR was highly correlated with NDVI (Figure 6), the importance of FPAR was very low in the RF model. This was because NDVI was directly derived from the satellite spectrum, while FPAR was indirectly calculated based on LAI and the physical models. The uncertainties in the MODIS LAI product can be attributed to the input data (surface reflectance or radiation data), model imperfections, and the inversion process [52]. The Pearson correlation coefficient for Tmean (r = 0.64) lay in the range of those for Tmax (r = 0.65) and Tmin (r = 0.60), as Tmean incorporated both day- and nighttime conditions (Figure 6). Generally, all these predictors were involved to different degrees in CO2 exchange processes. Vegetation indices (i.e., NDVI and LAI), related to the phenological properties of the plants, had the greatest influence on GPP variations. In terms of meteorological factors, DSR, Tmax and FPAR carried the information of the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis, which had a moderate effect on the GPP changes. In particular, Tmean, Tmin, VPD and RH showed weak influences on the GPP cycles.", 3. Results, 3.2. Driving Factors of GPP on a Seasonal Scale,3
224,"The RF model performed well for both the training (R2 = 0.99, RMSE = 0.42 g C m−2 d−1) and testing (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 2.8 g C m−2 d−1) datasets (Figure 7a,b). This indicated that the input variables in the RF model were representative and can accurately capture the temporal characteristics of GPP. RF model also proved to be good at the validation site (i.e., Dafeng site), in which the seasonal distributions of GPPRF showed high correlation and coherence with GPPEC (IA = 0.94, Figure 8c). All sites exhibited double peaks, with the peaks during the rice growth season being higher than those during the wheat growth season (Figure 8), which is a common pattern in this double-cropping field. The R2 and RMSE at the validation site (i.e., Dafeng site) were 0.80 and 4.39 g C m−2 d−1 (Figure 7d)—a result that was similar to that across global FLUXNET sites conducted by Tramontana et al. [53], in which the R2 ranged from 0.61 to 0.81. Hence, the RF model was deemed suitable for GPP prediction at unknown stations as well as regional GPP upscaling.", 3. Results, 3.3. Random Forest Model Evaluation,3
225,"Figure 9a–c show that the regional RF-modeled cumulative seasonal GPP (GPPRF) averaged from 23 weather stations and 3 EC stations during the period of 2014–2018 was much higher for the rice growth seasons (924 g C m−2) than that for the wheat growth seasons (532 g C m−2). This relationship (cumulative seasonal GPP in the rice growth season > cumulative seasonal GPP in the wheat growth season) was also be confirmed by the GPPMOD in Figure 9d–f. For our study sites, the annual mean for GPPMOD and GPPRF averaged from 23 weather stations and 3 EC stations were 966 g C m−2 and 1548 g C m−2, respectively. Figure 9g–i show the difference between the two GPP products across all sites (relative error at each site as computed by (GPPMOD–GPPRF) × 100/GPPRF) during the period of 2014–2018. Relative errors exhibited negative values across all sites, with −18–−46% for rice growing seasons, −1–−50% for wheat growing seasons and −5–−47% for the whole year, respectively. In general, relative errors during the wheat growing seasons were relatively larger than those during the rice growing seasons/the whole year at most sites (Figure 9g–i).To examine the spatial consistency of the GPPRF dynamics among the upscaled sites, Figure 10 shows the seasonal variations in GPPRF among 23 weather stations and 3 EC stations during the period of 2014–2018 over the rice–wheat-rotation cropland in the North Yangtze River Delta region. The daily mean GPPRF averaged from 23 weather stations and 3 EC stations during the period of 2014–2018 for wheat was lower than 2 g C m−2 d−1 during the winter extensive bare soil period (December–February). It started to increase in the active tillering stage (March) and reached a maximum of about 8–10 g C m−2 d−1 during the heading stage (late April), and next decreased to around 4 g C m−2 d−1 at harvest. The largest daily GPPRF for rice paddies occurred in late July, with a peak value of about 11 g C m−2 d−1, suggesting that the rice biological activities (e.g., photosynthetic rates) were quite strong at this stage. After that, daily GPPRF decreased to approximately 1 g C m−2 d−1 at rice harvest (Figure 10). Generally, good consistency was found in the seasonal variation among all upscaled sites, exhibiting similarly temporal characteristics of the real GPP over the rice–wheat-rotation system (Figure 4).", 3. Results, 3.4. Upscaled GPP,3
226,"Based on the upscaled results of GPPRF and GPPMOD at the station scale in the previous section, the relationship between GPPRF and GPPMOD is shown in Figure 11. Here, the daily GPPRF was aggregated to 8-day sums to match the 8-day GPPMOD product.Then, the linear relationship between GPPMOD (Figure 12a–c) and the calibrated GPP MOD (GPPCMOD) (Figure 12d–f) at the grid scale was established as follows:

Both GPPMOD and GPPCMOD exhibited a higher value during the rice growth seasons than that during the wheat growth seasons. The annual mean GPP in most parts of the NYRD varied from 2 to 4 g C m−2 d−1 for GPPMOD and 4 to 6 g C m−2 d−1 for GPPCMOD, with the higher values in the eastern coastal areas of the NYRD (Figure 12c,f). Here, sea–land breezes prevail, carrying rainfall and water resources sufficient to favor crop growth. Figure 12g–i show the seasonal mean of the error ranges of daily GPP (∆GPP, as computed by subtracting GPPMOD (Figure 12a–c) from GPPCMOD (Figure 12d–f)) during the period of 2014–2018. ∆GPP in most parts of the NYRD ranged between 2 and 4 g C m−2 d−1 during the rice growing seasons, while they were smaller (i.e., 0–1.5 g C m−2 d−1) for wheat. The probability density function (PDF) of ∆GPP in the NYRD is shown in Figure 13. The PDF of ∆GPP varies seasonally, which play a pivotal role in regulating the carbon dynamics in the NYRD. Rice paddies had a broader distribution in the peak PDF of the mean ∆GPP than that for wheat fields, i.e., between 0.75 and 1.25 g C m−2 d−1 during the wheat growth seasons, between 2.5 and 3.25 g C m−2 d−1 during the rice growth seasons, and around 1.75 g C m−2 d−1 for the annual mean.", 3. Results, 3.5. Calibration of the MOD17A2H GPP Product,3
227,"In this work, three rice–wheat-rotation cropland EC sites were quantified and used to explore the complexity of the drivers of spatio-temporal variation in GPP. In order to eliminate the errors induced by instrument measurements, Table 2 only summarized GPP values in EC-based literatures. The cumulative GPP for the wheat fields ranged from 609 to 848 g C m−2 in eastern China, which was equivalent to that reported in India (621 g C m−2, ref. [54]) but lower than that reported in Germany (1241 g C m−2, ref. [55]) and northern China (1174 g C m−2, ref. [56]). The total seasonal GPP during the rice growing season in eastern China (889–1170 g C m−2) was higher than that in India (811 g C m−2, ref. [57]) and the Philippines (778 g C m−2, ref. [51]). The discrepancy in the cumulative seasonal GPP among the previous studies is probably because of the difference in local meteorological conditions (e.g., precipitation, air temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation) and phenology (e.g., growth duration, NDVI and LAI) [55,56,57]. For example, the summer rice growing season was warmer (23–24 °C in eastern China) and received more precipitation (735–1028 mm in eastern China, Table 2) as compared with the winter wheat growing season. The mean seasonal GPP for rice paddies (889–1170 g C m−2) was obviously higher than those for wheat fields (609–848 g C m−2) in eastern China, mostly because of the different crop growth conditions. Furthermore, values of 609–848 g C m−2 for winter wheat fields in eastern China were lower than the value of 1174 g C m−2 in northern China, mainly because the growth duration of winter wheat in northern China is generally longer [56].In addition to the meteorological factors and phenology, crop management (e.g., fertilizer) and edaphoclimatic conditions (e.g., soil temperature, soil water content and microbial populations) also have influences on the GPP dynamics. The fertilization time for wheat and rice is basically fixed (Figure 2) during the sowing period (early June for rice and middle November for wheat) and the tillering period (early July for rice and late February for wheat). Chen et al. [15] reported that the basic fertilizer applied during the rice/wheat sowing period had the most remarkable effect, with an increase in GPP reaching 2–3 g C m–2d–1 over 8 days. Spraying leaf fertilization during the crop tillering stages had a minor effect on GPP, with an increase in GPP up to 1–2 g C m–2d–1 over 8 days. Edaphoclimatic conditions (such as soil temperature and soil moisture) varied seasonally, modulating the GPP dynamics [18]. However, detailed information about the in situ fertilization and the edaphoclimatic conditions was not available for us to input into our RF models. Considering the importance of these factors, nevertheless, we cannot ignore the potential influence of the crop management or edaphoclimatic conditions.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Complexity of the Drivers of Spatio-Temporal Variation in GPP,4
228,"Figure 4 shows the inconsistency between GPPMOD and GPPEC at the three sites, which can be attributed to three aspects: (a) input parameters such as FPAR data and meteorological conditions [49]; (b) the uncertainties in the MOD17A2H GPP algorithm [2]; and (c) the spatial mismatch between remotely sensed pixels and EC footprints [58,59]. In the past few decades, a wide network of sites have been established across various ecosystems and climate regions; for example, AmeriFlux, Integrated Carbon Observation System, National Ecological Observatory Network, and FluxNet [60,61]. These EC sites provide potential opportunities to annually update the cropland sites in the land cover maps, redefine the MOD17 cropland parameters and greatly improve GPPMOD at regional or even global scales. To the best of our knowledge, China has the largest area of the rice–wheat-rotation croplands in the world. In China, these croplands are distributed widely along the Yangtze River Basin (Figure 1, inset map), covering around 13 Mha in total [24]. This rotation cropland system is a non-negligible part of the agroecosystem. While the MOD17 algorithm defines only 11 land cover classes, i.e., one type of cropland, one type of woodland, two types of grasslands, two types of shrubland and five types of forests [49]. Therefore, the large discrepancy between GPPMOD and GPPEC over the rice–wheat-rotation cropland indicates that the parameters in the MOD17 product should be modified and more types of cropland (e.g., double-cropping or mixed-cropping systems) should be defined.Meanwhile, the MOD17 GPP product has a fine resolution with 500 m, and so the high-quality MOD17 GPP product can be employed to accurately assess the ecosystem’s carbon cycle and agricultural productions. In particular, out-of-academy precision agriculture or commercialized precision agriculture put forward higher requirements for the accuracy evaluation of GPP products. Nowadays, EC-based calibration of MODIS products is a common method. In the present work, due to the study being limited to three EC sites over rotation cropland areas in eastern China, the observations cannot be used to stand for the whole area. Therefore, we proposed the machine learning-based GPP prediction model for 23 meteorological sites by using multi-source data to derive more virtual EC sites (23 sites) over the whole area, which can offer more ground-based GPP samples for calibrating MOD17 GPP. Generally, the simulations of the RF-based GPP models show a better performance with respect to other machine learning methods (e.g., Decision Tree Regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, and deep belief network, referring to Figures S1–S4 in the Supplementary Materials), which is consistent with the results in Yu et al. [23]. In our present work, thus, RF-based upscaling and calibrating methods are more suitable over large-scale agroecosystem areas if EC measurements, meteorological observations and MODIS data are available.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Potential Discrepancy between GPPEC and GPPMOD,4
229,"In this study, the GPP estimated from EC flux measurements over rice–wheat-rotation cropland can represent the amount of carbon uptake by the main land cover type in the NYRD area. To obtain multiple samples for calibration of the MOD17A2H GPP product, a RF model for estimating GPP was designed by integrating multi-source satellite retrievals and in situ ground observations during the period of 2014–2018 over the rice–wheat double-cropping fields of eastern China. The RF model showed that multiple co-acting factors (NDVI, LAI, DSR, Tmax, and FPAR) modulate GPP dynamics. GPPRF performed well when compared with GPPEC, with a R2 of 0.99 and RMSE of 0.42 g C m−2 d−1, indicating these explanatory variables are reasonably representative and reliable for regional GPP upscaling. The regional upscaled cumulative seasonal GPPRF in rice paddies (924 g C m−2) was roughly two times higher than that in a wheat field (532 g C m−2) at the station scale, probably because of the much longer growing season and lower LAI of wheat. Compared with GPPEC, this indicates that GPPMOD underestimates GPP during the active crop growth stages but performs well during the crop rotation periods. Based on the upscaled results of GPPRF at the station scale, the functional relationship between GPPMOD and GPPRF at the grid scale was established to calibrate the GPPMOD. The error range of ∆GPP (GPPRF minus GPPMOD) was higher for rice paddies than for wheat fields, i.e., between 0.75 and 1.25 g C m−2 d−1 during the wheat growth seasons, between 2.5 and 3.25 g C m−2 d−1 during the rice growth seasons, along with an annual mean of 1.75–2 g C m−2 d−1.To sum up, the GPP in rice–wheat-rotation agroecosystems is considerably diverse and varies with the seasons. Our findings are potentially applicable in terms of the climate response of greenhouse gases over wide-scale cropland areas. Our research demonstrates that RF machine learning is a powerful and expedient modeling tool for estimating and even calibrating the MODIS GPP product. In future, it would be worthwhile using global FLUXNET data, multi-source satellite observations and machine learning methods to simulate the GPP in more ecosystem types (e.g., grassland and forests) and climate zones at large scales to fully understand the nature of global carbon dynamics.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
230,"Mangroves are distributed in >120 countries throughout the world [1]. Mangrove ecosystems support high floral and faunal biodiversity and provide a diverse range of goods to coastal communities (e.g., food, fuel, building materials). Mangroves also provide key services such as water filtration, mitigating coastal erosion, and storm protection [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25]. Mangrove forests often have greater carbon stocks than their terrestrial peers, and are therefore important to global climate change mitigation through CO2 sequestration [14]. Despite their value, global mangrove distribution continues to decline primarily due to anthropogenic activities [26,27]. Annual global mangrove loss is estimated at 1%–2% over the past several decades [7,28,29,30,31,32].The region encompassing South (i.e., S) Asia, Southeast (i.e., SE) Asia and Asia-Pacific is home to approximately 46% of the world’s mangroves [33]. Throughout this region, mangroves are typically highly productive ecosystems, containing the oldest and most biodiverse mangrove forests of the world [30,34,35]. Regional rates of loss are also the highest in the world, primarily due to anthropogenic activities [36,37]. Anthropogenic drivers of loss stem from the underlying processes of population increase, industrialisation, urbanisation and globalisation, i.e., an increasing demand for commodities [27,31]. Primary drivers include conversion of land to aquaculture, oil palm plantations and rice paddies, coastal development, and over-extraction for woody materials [38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46]. Natural phenomena, e.g., rising ocean temperatures and sea-levels and tropical storms also influence mangrove dynamics [7,11,32,38,44,47,48,49,50,51,52].While the overall trend in S Asia, SE Asia and Asia-Pacific is mangrove loss, the disparate nature of anthropogenic drivers has resulted in variable dynamics [31]. Some mangrove areas remain relatively intact, owing to characteristics such as remoteness and inaccessibility, or protected status [53]. Some mangrove areas are even increasing in extent following successful reforestation initiatives and/or natural gain [54,55]. Within this region, sub-regions and countries experiencing relatively substantial loss (i.e., mangrove deforestation hotspots) warrant closer attention and intervention (i.e., loss mitigation activities). Up-to-date and accurate information regarding current and historical mangrove distribution and condition is vital to inform conservation, restoration and managed-use. Such information helps countries in their pursuit of environmental targets, e.g., as set out by Millennium Development Goals or the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands [26,53,56]. Remotely sensed data has been widely used to map mangrove distributions and their dynamics from global to local scales and inform mitigation efforts [15,57]. Remotely sensed data is widely accessible and offers a far cheaper alternative to field-based techniques which are only practical at the local-scale [58]. The ease in which derived information can be updated (given the unrivalled temporal resolution of satellite imaging) presents another advantage, and highlights the utility of remote sensing techniques for large-scale mangrove monitoring projects [15,53,59]. Previous research has inventoried and compared mangrove datasets derived from remotely sensed data [60,61]. Hamilton et al. [60] focused on the Western Hemisphere and Oceana, and on datasets since 2000. Hu et al. [61] conducted an inventory at the global scale for 1990–2016. No studies have simultaneously focused on inventory, comprehensive description and comparison of datasets specifically for S Asia, SE Asia and Asia-Pacific, including all historic datasets.Here we focus on S Asia, SE Asia and Asia-Pacific, collectively referred to as the region of interest (ROI). This report serves to (1) inventory, describe and compare single- and multi-date geospatial datasets derived from remotely sensed data which provide information about the multi-national and/or national distribution of mangrove ecosystems within the ROI, and (2) use multi-date datasets to extract dynamics and identify a short-list of “hotspots” for mangrove loss based on countries which have exhibited the most proportional loss. The findings inform mangrove conservation, restoration and managed-use initiatives within the ROI through targeting deforestation hotspots in greatest need of intervention.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
231,"The Region of Interest (ROI) includes 20 countries (Bangladesh, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Fiji, India, Indonesia, Kiribati, Malaysia, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Myanmar, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, Thailand, Timor-Leste, Vanuatu and Vietnam) and 2 territories (Guam and Northern Mariana Islands) across three major sub-regions: S Asia, SE Asia and the Asia-Pacific (Figure 1). Maldives, Nauru and the French territory of New Caledonia were added due to their inclusion in referenced studies and geographic proximity. The ROI contains approximately 46% of the world’s mangrove ecosystems largely due to ideal climatic conditions and extensive coastlines [30,33]. Regionally, mangrove ecosystems are exceptionally biodiverse—approximately 80% of all mangrove species are found within the Indo-Pacific between South India and Northern Australia [62], and SE Asia alone boasts 51 species [30] compared to approximately 10 in Africa or the Americas [63]. Throughout the ROI there exists a strong relationship between local coastal populations and mangrove ecosystems [30].Approximately 5.8% of the world’s mangroves are found specifically in the S Asia sub-region [33], distributed primarily in sporadic coastal pockets [19]. This sub-region includes the world’s largest mangrove ecosystem, the Sundarbans, covering approximately 1,000,000 ha at the India-Bangladesh interface [65]. Throughout this sub-region, loss is attributed to land-cover conversion, pollution, over-harvesting for timber and natural drivers including cyclones, tsunamis and coastal erosion [66].SE Asia contains approximately 35.6% of the world’s mangroves and notably contains the greatest mangrove diversity representing 51 of the world’s known 73 species [30,33,36]. In this sub-region, 30% of all mangrove loss between 2000 and 2012 was attributed to conversion for aquaculture [28,31]. Conversion to rice agriculture has also been a major driver in certain countries, such as Myanmar, whilst in Malaysia and Indonesia loss is mostly attributed to conversion for palm oil plantations [31]. Situated within a highly seismically active zone mangroves here are subjected to tsunamis, as well as other natural loss drivers such as hurricanes and cyclones [62].Mangroves in the Asia-Pacific make up 4.8% of the world’s mangroves distributed across numerous Pacific islands, many of which are volcanic with mountainous terrain which limits low-elevation intertidal areas suitable for mangrove establishment. Mangroves here are typically found in deltas and estuaries of established river systems, the largest of which are in Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, New Caledonia and Fiji. Given the low-lying nature of many Pacific islands, climate change, sea-level rise and coastal erosion pose significant threats to the mangroves of this sub-region [62].", 2.

232,"All global, multi-national and national-level mangrove datasets providing single or multi-date coverage within the ROI—up until January, 2019—were inventoried through an exhaustive internet-based search and literature review, and contacting experts with regional experience. Where possible, freely available datasets were obtained from online repositories. For datasets not available through repositories, authors were contacted. Table 1 lists the pertinent datasets (or subsets of datasets) that were not acquired as part of this process, providing author details and the names and status of their corresponding datasets. For those datasets that were unavailable to acquire, inventorying and description was possible by referring to relevant literature.Once inventoried, all single- and multi-date datasets were described based on the following criteria: brief summary of dataset, spatial and temporal coverage, imagery source(s), mapping methods, resulting land-cover classes, accuracy assessment, mangrove distribution, dataset limitations and details of how dataset was acquired. 2.2.1. Single-Date Mangrove DistributionSingle-date mangrove distributions were extracted for each country/territory from all inventoried datasets. Where provided, distribution values were extracted from publications and supporting materials (including for those datasets listed in Table 1 already published). For inventoried datasets for which data were actually available/acquired, distribution values were extracted from the actual datasets based on country/territory boundaries. The borders of countries/territories were geographically defined by combining political boundaries with corresponding exclusive economic zones (EEZ). Country polygons were sourced from the Global Administrative Boundaries database (v3.6, www.gadm.org) [65] and EEZs from Marine Regions (v10 World EEZ, www.marineregions.org) [70]. Country polygons and EEZs were merged and persisting gaps in coverage removed using GIS software to define distinct boundaries for which mangrove extent was calculated. 2.2.2. Multi-Date Mangrove DynamicsDifferences between single-date studies were not used to calculate mangrove dynamics, as results would likely be influenced by disparate mapping methodologies and accuracies. This is backed up by findings in [53], in which the authors identify significant (and variable) discrepancies between different global products ([30,33,53]) at regional and sub-country levels. Therefore dynamics were only extracted and reported on from multi-date mangrove distribution datasets i.e., extracted from publications/supporting material, or directly from datasets, for each associated country/territory as defined by combined country and EEZ polygons.Building on reported accuracies, accuracy was further qualitatively assessed for acquired multi-date datasets through cross-checking against high-spatial resolution satellite imagery viewable in Google Earth Pro (GEP). The qualitative accuracy assessment (i.e., QAA) of multi-date datasets allowed for a more meaningful assessment of mangrove representation, providing a further indicator of reliability of this study’s dynamics assessment. QAA was only possible when datasets were acquired. Table 1 refers to four multi-date datasets that were not available from online repositories nor acquired from authors ([19,31,68,69]), a further dataset not acquired due to associated cost [55], and two more yet to be (wholly or partially) published ([53,67]). Furthermore QAA was not conducted unless datasets explicitly mapped mangrove forest. When available, multi-date datasets were typically acquired in raster format, and in a range of coordinate systems necessitating several pre-processing steps to enable QAAs. These steps included (1) extracting the mangrove class from the raster layer, (2) converting mangrove class into a vector layer, (3) aggregating vector layer from multipart features to single part feature layer, (4) applying distinctive symbology fit for the GEP interface, and (5) converting symbolised layer into a KML file for bringing into GEP. In addition, the limited processing power of GEP (regardless of computing power) required simplifying large multi-featured datasets, causing GEP to freeze indefinitely, or run with an unmanageably slow response rate. Extensive trial and error identified a maximum number of 40,000 features at which QAA could be reasonably undertaken. Each QAA was based on 100 × 100 km areas of interest (AOIs) divided into 10 × 10 km boxes. Depending on geographic coverage and initial observations of the internal variability of mangrove ecosystems, 1-2 AOIs were used per dataset. Working from NW to SE, every fourth 10 × 10 km box containing mangroves was selected for spot-checking, such that 25% of each AOI was systematically assessed. For each spot-check, mangrove coverage was assessed against GEP imagery as close to the dataset’s date as possible. If imagery was not available within five years of the mangrove dataset’s temporal focus, QAA was not undertaken. In some instances, part of an image was cloud-covered or low quality, again limiting the ability to conduct QAA (a limitation noted by Estoque et al. [71]). Drawing on canopy-cover definitions described in Jones et al. [72], four mangrove classes were assessed for each spot-check: (1) closed-canopy: tall, mature stands, >60% closed, (2) open-canopy: medium, short or stunted stands, 30–60% closed, (3) sparse/dwarf: short or stunted stands <30 % closed, often found on the margins of mangrove habitats, or in colder/less favourable climates/conditions, (4) fringing/strip: thin, linear stands typically along coastlines or small inward channels. Each class was assessed as either well-, under- or over-represented. The results of QAA and overall suitability (i.e., temporal and spatial coverage) help contextualise the use of multi-date datasets for assessing dynamics.", 2. Experimental Section," 2.2.

Therefore dynamics were only extracted and reported on from multi-date mangrove distribution datasets i.e., extracted from publications/supporting material, or directly from datasets, for each associated country/territory as defined by combined country and EEZ polygons.Building on reported accuracies, accuracy was further qualitatively assessed for acquired multi-date datasets through cross-checking against high-spatial resolution satellite imagery viewable in Google Earth Pro (GEP). The qualitative accuracy assessment (i.e., QAA) of multi-date datasets allowed for a more meaningful assessment of mangrove representation, providing a further indicator of reliability of this study’s dynamics assessment. QAA was only possible when datasets were acquired. Table 1 refers to four multi-date datasets that were not available from online repositories nor acquired from authors ([19,31,68,69]), a further dataset not acquired due to associated cost [55], and two more yet to be (wholly or partially) published ([53,67]). Furthermore QAA was not conducted unless datasets explicitly mapped mangrove forest. When available, multi-date datasets were typically acquired in raster format, and in a range of coordinate systems necessitating several pre-processing steps to enable QAAs. These steps included (1) extracting the mangrove class from the raster layer, (2) converting mangrove class into a vector layer, (3) aggregating vector layer from multipart features to single part feature layer, (4) applying distinctive symbology fit for the GEP interface, and (5) converting symbolised layer into a KML file for bringing into GEP. In addition, the limited processing power of GEP (regardless of computing power) required simplifying large multi-featured datasets, causing GEP to freeze indefinitely, or run with an unmanageably slow response rate. Extensive trial and error identified a maximum number of 40,000 features at which QAA could be reasonably undertaken. Each QAA was based on 100 × 100 km areas of interest (AOIs) divided into 10 × 10 km boxes. Depending on geographic coverage and initial observations of the internal variability of mangrove ecosystems, 1-2 AOIs were used per dataset. Working from NW to SE, every fourth 10 × 10 km box containing mangroves was selected for spot-checking, such that 25% of each AOI was systematically assessed. For each spot-check, mangrove coverage was assessed against GEP imagery as close to the dataset’s date as possible. If imagery was not available within five years of the mangrove dataset’s temporal focus, QAA was not undertaken. In some instances, part of an image was cloud-covered or low quality, again limiting the ability to conduct QAA (a limitation noted by Estoque et al. [71]). Drawing on canopy-cover definitions described in Jones et al. [72], four mangrove classes were assessed for each spot-check: (1) closed-canopy: tall, mature stands, >60% closed, (2) open-canopy: medium, short or stunted stands, 30–60% closed, (3) sparse/dwarf: short or stunted stands <30 % closed, often found on the margins of mangrove habitats, or in colder/less favourable climates/conditions, (4) fringing/strip: thin, linear stands typically along coastlines or small inward channels. Each class was assessed as either well-, under- or over-represented. The results of QAA and overall suitability (i.e., temporal and spatial coverage) help contextualise the use of multi-date datasets for assessing dynamics.", 2. Experimental Section, 2.2.2. Multi-Date Mangrove Dynamics,2
235,"Five global datasets (i.e., A–E), four sub-region-wide datasets (i.e., F–I), three multi-national datasets (i.e., J,K,M) and four single-nation datasets (i.e., L,N–P) are inventoried in this study (Table 2). For all datasets, single- and multi-date mangrove distributions are partitioned according to discrete mangrove coverage (i.e., presence versus absence) versus representations of continuous attributes (i.e., canopy cover). As continuous measures are comparatively lower than discrete measures, the data is split by type of measure to avoid masking patterns within the data. (A) Mangrove Forests of the World, 2000, Giri et al. (2011) [33]The most widely-used and referenced global mangrove dataset is Mangrove Forests of the World (MFW) by Giri et al. [33]. Giri et al. [33] was the first comprehensive global assessment of mangrove distribution produced using satellite imagery, providing spatially explicit information at a moderate spatial resolution (i.e., 30 m) for all countries/territories in the ROI circa 2000. The global dataset was produced using approximately 1000 Landsat images (specific sensor information not reported), subset to include areas where mangroves were likely to occur. A hybrid supervised/unsupervised classification approach, using the (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis) ISODATA clustering algorithm, generated 50–150 spectral clusters and four land-cover classes: mangrove, non-mangrove, barren lands and water. The resulting database was evaluated against existing datasets (findings not reported), whilst qualitative validation by local experts employed high spatial resolution QuickBird and IKONOS imagery. Geometric correction reduced root mean square (RMS) error to ±1/2 pixel. MFW estimated 6,068,096 ha of mangrove within the ROI in 2000. Given (A) [33] is a single-date dataset, QAA was not undertaken. Due to the moderate resolution of Landsat data used, small patches of mangrove (<900–2700 m2) were not well captured in the results. Country-level mangrove extent was extracted from both the dataset (vector format from the UN Ocean Data Viewer [79]; raster format from NASA’s Socioeconomic Data and Applications Centre (SEDAC) [80]) and from figures reported in Giri et al. [33]. There are discrepancies between mangrove extents as calculated from the downloaded dataset versus figures published for seven of the countries in the ROI. Discrepancies are <5% except in Indonesia where downloaded data presents 13% less mangrove extent, and Malaysia where data presents 10% more (Table 3). As such (and where possible), figures reported in [33] are favoured over those extracted from the data. Country extent figures are presented in Table 4, Figure 2a,b.(B) World Atlas of Mangroves (WAM) v3, Spalding et al. (2010) [30]Spalding et al. [30] incorporated numerous sources including national- and regional-scale mapping to produce a global atlas of mangroves circa 1999–2003. Where gaps in coverage remained, (A) [33] was used to complete coverage. Of interest to this report are the remote sensing-derived national extents, of which two such studies contribute substantially to WAM. Corcoran et al. [81] used Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced TM (ETM+) scenes for 1999–2001 to produce mangrove distribution maps over Western and Central Africa. This was later replicated by Spalding et al. [30] over Papua New Guinea and Vietnam. The authors employed an unsupervised classification approach, however information regarding methods (i.e., clustering algorithm, land-cover classes) is limited and error metrics are not provided. Cloud-removal pre-processing was not undertaken, resulting in probable inaccuracies. Rosati et al. [82] harnessed the experience of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation’s (FAO) Environmental Climate Change and Bioenergy Division by employing Landsat ETM+ scenes to map mangroves across 31 countries (including 12 within the ROI). Mangrove forest was identified and digitised through qualitative interpretation using bespoke software, rather than through image classification techniques. No error metrics or shortcomings were reported however considerable qualitative validation was conducted by experts with detailed field knowledge, with feedback suggesting a high mapping accuracy and a low level of amendments required. Within the ROI, WAM estimated mangrove extents of 1,034,400 ha in S Asia; 5,104,900 ha in SE Asia; and 571,700 ha across what is a more broadly defined as ‘Pacific’ (Table 4, Figure 2a,b). Given (B) [30] is a single-date dataset, QAA was not undertaken. The complete WAM layer can be downloaded from the UN Ocean Data Viewer [79].(C) Global Forest Change database, 2000–2017, Hansen et al. (2013) [73]The Global Forest Change (GFC) database employed Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery to produce a global map of percentage tree cover per pixel (i.e., a general ‘forest’ class) for year 2000 at a spatial resolution of 30 m. A supervised (bagged decision tree) classification was used to identify tree cover and change, making use of parallel processing in Google Earth Engine. The database therefore also calculates annual deforestation from 2000–2017 showing stand-replacement disturbance or complete removal of canopy-cover (i.e., forest cover loss), and the inverse (i.e., forest cover gain) as a twelve year total between 2000 and 2012. A validation exercise used probability-based stratified random sampling. Global accuracy is reported as 99.6% for areas of forest loss or no loss, and 99.7% for forest gain or no gain. Gain was assigned to pixels in which non-forest changed to forest, with tree crown cover densities > 50%. For tropical regions these accuracy figures are 99.5% and 99.7% respectively [73]. Change dynamics for mangrove forest are calculated and reported by (D) [67], and extracted for the ROI in this study (Table 5, Figure 3 and Figure 4). Positional accuracy is not reported by the authors. QAA was not undertaken, with priority given to mangrove-focused datasets, however there are notable limitations with this dataset. Firstly, “forest” includes all forests, making no distinction between terrestrial and mangrove. Richards and Friess (H) [31] further cite the inclusion of plantations or semi-natural forests as a limitation. Secondly, forest is defined using a threshold of >5 m wherein lower-stature mangroves are under-represented or completely left out. Testing the GFC over Ambaro-Ambanja Bays (AAB) in NW Madagascar confirmed this limitation—the GFC displayed no mangrove deforestation, wherein multiple studies confirm loss here is extensive [25,67,83]. The complete GFC layer can be downloaded from the GFC’s Data Download page [73].(D) Continuous Mangrove Forest Cover for 21st Century (CGMFC-21), Hamilton and Casey (2016) [67]The CGMFC-21 product builds on (C)’s [73] use of Landsat ETM+ imagery to map global mangrove change from 2000–2014, at a spatial resolution of 30 m. Two global mangrove extent products were produced by masking GFC using (1) (A) [33] and (2) the Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World (TEOW) [84]. TEOW was not compiled using remote sensing methods so is not considered in this study. Areas of forest and annual change within the masked extent were identified from GFC annually to produce maps of canopy-cover (m2), resulting in continuous (rather than discrete) mangrove coverage. Areas of mangrove change outside of the baseline area (i.e., (A) [33]) are therefore excluded. Accuracy was tested by way of comparison with the only other study reporting similar resolution continuous forest cover available, the USGS National Land Cover Dataset [85] over the United States. Comparison for mangroves in Florida identified a 3.6% disagreement, providing some assurance of accuracy for CGMFC-21. The positional error of the CGMFC-21 product is that of MFW [33], i.e., a published RMS error of ±1/2 pixel. The product estimated 4,477,769 ha of mangroves in the ROI in 2000, falling to 4,310,725 ha by 2014 (Table 5). This equals a 3.7% decline in extent between 2000–2014, or 0.27% per annum. However, pixels containing just 0.01% forest canopy cover are included as mangrove—this falls well below commonly used minimum canopy-cover definition of 30% for mangrove forest [e.g., [25,67,83]. Initial comparisons with known areas of mangrove loss (e.g., AAB, Madagascar) indicate that due to the aforementioned limitations, mangrove loss is often under-represented. QAA was further conducted for 2014 data over two AOIs in the ROI: North Sulawesi, Indonesia and the Irrawaddy Delta, Myanmar, confirming that low-stature-mangrove forest was under-represented. Dynamics for 19 countries and one territory are presented in and were extracted from (D) [67] (Table 5, Figure 3 and Figure 4). The complete CGMFC-21 layer can be downloaded from its website (http://faculty.salisbury.edu/~sehamilton/ mangroves/).(E) Global Mangrove Watch 2010—a fused optical with SAR approach, Bunting et al. (2018) [53]The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s (JAXA) Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) initiative has generated a baseline global mangrove extent map for 2010. Phased-Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data from the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) was used due to its global coverage and sensitivity to the physical characteristics of mangrove forest [59]. Due to limitations with L-band SAR (difficulties in distinguishing mangrove from other forms of vegetation at the landward margin), SAR was fused with Landsat TM and ETM+ data resulting in a global map at 25 m spatial resolution. This project is notable for primarily using SAR data in contrast to most other studies that utilise optical datasets, thus exploiting cloud-free, seamless coverage. The methodology involved four stages: (1) extracting a coastal mask, (2) generating a mangrove “habitat” layer where mangrove can plausibly exist, (3) using PALSAR data to generate an initial baseline, and (4) incorporating Landsat composites to refine and eliminate errors in the baseline. The “habitat” layer was defined and generated using five input variables: (1) longitude and latitude, (2) distance to water, (3) surface elevation, (4) distance to an oceanic layer and (5) distance to existing global mangrove classifications (i.e., (A) [33] and (B) [30]). The authors encourage subsequent mapping efforts to make use of this “habitat” layer, though it is yet to be published on the GMW website [53]. Supervised classifications were produced using the Extremely Randomized Trees classifier which defined 500 estimators, generating water, mangrove and terrestrial non-mangrove classes. A stratified random sampling accuracy assessment identified an overall accuracy of 95.3% (based on 53,878 sample points). The authors do not report on the map’s positional accuracy. GMW estimated 5,835,322 ha of mangroves within the ROI as of 2010, however no coverage was included for Fiji, Guam, Kiribati and areas east of the antemeridian due to satellite data unavailability (Table 4, Figure 2a,b). QAA was not undertaken given this is a single-date dataset. However, the authors note that due to the moderate resolution of satellite datasets used, fine-scale features were commonly miss-classified, for example aquaculture features, riverine environments, and coastal fringes. The authors suggest a minimum mapping unit of 1 ha for end-user mapping. From early 2019 the GMW initiative plans to provide additional annual maps for years including 1996 using the “map-to-image” method presented by Thomas et al. [86], and using time-series radar imagery e.g., from JERS-1 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2. GMW 2010 baseline extents for six countries within the ROI are presented in Bunting et al. [53]) and the remaining extents were extracted from data downloaded from the UN Ocean Data Viewer [79] (Table 4, Figure 2a,b). The complete layer can be downloaded from the UN Ocean Data Viewer [79].(F) Land-cover map for South and Southeast Asia, Stibig et al. (2007) [74]This study used coarse (1 km) resolution imagery from the VEGETATION (VGT) 1 Earth observing sensor aboard SPOT-4 to map land cover classes for S and SE Asia circa 1998–2000. 26 land cover classes were identified using an unsupervised maximum likelihood classification, including “mangrove forest”. Class assignment was validated using Landsat TM images, field knowledge and existing land-cover maps. The classification achieved a mapping accuracy of 72% for the dominant classes of ‘forest’ and ‘cropland’, though no error metrics were reported specifically for mangrove. Geometric fidelity is reported as within 500 m. The land-cover map identified 4,820,000 ha of mangrove across the ROI. Whilst VGT’s coarse spatial resolution of 1 km makes the study useful at a regional scale, the authors acknowledge an evident impact on accuracy at the national level. This is exacerbated by the fragmented, fringing nature of mangrove habitat, resulting in a complete absence of identified mangrove for much of the ROI. For this reason, this study’s areal extents are not included. The data is available to download from European Commission’s Joint Research Centre website [87].(G) Distribution and dynamics of mangrove forests of S Asia, Giri et al. (2015) [19]This study employed Landsat ETM+ to assess mangrove cover change between 2000–2012 in Bangladesh, India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Three case studies were also assessed in greater spatial and thematic detail: Indus Delta (Pakistan), Goa (India) and Sundarbans (India and Bangladesh). A supervised Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm was employed in Google Earth Engine, generating mangrove, water and ‘others’ (i.e., combined barren land, agriculture, habitation) land-cover classes. Visual validation by local experts using existing mangrove distribution datasets and high resolution QuickBird and IKONOS imagery helped to improve classification results. Quantitative accuracy assessment was not undertaken, however positional error was successfully reduced to an RMS of less than half a pixel. Mangrove extent for 2000 was estimated as 421,091 ha in Bangladesh and 371,431 ha in India, falling by 2012 by 2.3% (to 411,487 ha) and 7.6% (to 343,065 ha) respectively (Table 4, Figure 2a). Post-classification change analysis identified mangrove dynamics and attributed change to natural or anthropogenic causes. The data was not available/acquired, therefore QAA was not possible. No notable limitations specific to this study are reported by the authors [19].(H) Mangrove deforestation in SE Asia, Richards and Friess (2016) [31]Building on the methodology adopted by (D) [67], this study assessed the rates and drivers of mangrove deforestation across ten countries in SE Asia: Brunei-Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam from 2000–2012. The methodology cross-referenced deforested pixels from (C) [73] (making use of Landsat ETM+ scenes) within a mask defined by (A) [33], therefore did not account for mangrove gain. Reported figures reflect rates of mangrove loss rather than net mangrove change, which is likely to have reduced areal figures. Deforestation pixels for each year were subtracted from the previous year’s total to estimate annual mangrove distribution. A supervised land-use classification method was then used to identify land-use in mangrove deforestation pixels (as identified by masking (C) [73] by (A) [33]). A 100 bootstraps model was used to assess land-use classification accuracy with a median Cohen κ value of 0.62 and a median accuracy of 68%. Six land-use classes were generated including mangrove-regrowth, thereby providing an alternative measure of mangrove gain, and mitigating against the effects of only extracting loss pixels from GFC. As with (D) [67], the positional accuracy is that of (A) [33], i.e., a published RMS error of ±1/2 pixel. Mangrove extent across these countries totalled 4,627,128 ha in 2000, falling to 4,564,371 ha by 2012 (a 1.4% fall over the period, or 0.1% per annum) (Table 5, Figure 3 and Figure 4). Limitations concerning the use of continuous forest cover measures apply here as with (D) [67], however post-processing removed some anomalous deforestation pixels by applying a “clump function” meaning only deforested pixels adjacent to other deforested pixels forming minimum patches of 0.5 ha were retained. The data was not available/acquired therefore QAA was not undertaken.(I) Mangrove Assessment in the Pacific, Bhattarai and Giri (2011) [62]This study used Landsat ETM+ data to produce a baseline map of mangrove extent across the Pacific circa 2000 including: American Samoa, Fiji, French Polynesia, Guam, Hawaii, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Nauru, New Caledonia, Northern Mariana Islands, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and Wallis and Futuna Islands. Classification and validation methods were similar to those outlined in (A) [33] and (G) [19], generating mangrove, non-mangrove and water land-cover classes, and achieving an overall accuracy of 93%. Mangrove extent within the ROI was estimated to be 569,350 ha with the vast majority in Papua New Guinea (480,121 ha). Given (I) [62] is a single-year dataset, QAA was not undertaken. The authors could not perform atmospheric correction due to the lack of data regarding atmospheric conditions in the Pacific region, thereby potentially introducing error into results. Distributions for nine countries and three territories are presented in and were extracted from (I) [62] (Table 4, Figure 2a,b). The data was not available to download and was not acquired.(J) Mangrove dynamics (1975–2005)—tsunami-affected regions of Asia, Giri et al. (2008) [75]This study mapped mangrove extent in regions of S and SE Asia affected by the 2004 tsunami. Approximately 700 Landsat images (Multispectral Scanner System (MSS), TM and ETM+) were used to produce four maps for years 1975, 1990, 2000 and 2005 across only tsunami-affected areas of six countries within the ROI: Bangladesh (entire country), India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar (entire country) and Thailand. Classification and validation methods are similar to those outlined in (A) [33], i.e., use of a hybrid supervised/unsupervised classification approach, using the ISODATA clustering algorithm to generate 50 spectral clusters and identify mangrove classes. Additional ground control points were selected to reduce RMS error to ±1/2 pixel. Quantitative accuracy assessments were not undertaken due to a lack of ground-truth data for historical dates, whilst a visual qualitative accuracy assessment by local experts using high-resolution QuickBird and IKONOS helped to correct significant errors. In 1975 mangrove extent was estimated at 448,073 ha in Bangladesh and 851,452 ha in Myanmar, falling by 2005 to 438,764 ha and 551,361 ha respectively (Table 4, Figure 2a,b, Figure 4). Whilst the reduction in extent over this period was minimal in Bangladesh (2%), the fall in Myanmar was substantial at 35%. Change analysis was conducted using a post-classification technique, which compared classification results from each of the four imaged years. Shortcomings with this approach as noted by (J) [75] include semantic differences in class definitions, positional and classification errors. Mangrove patches smaller than 1 ha were not mapped, likely reducing distribution figures. Maps were acquired from the authors but analysis was hindered due to unresolved dataset issues stemming from original analysis having been conducted >12 years ago. QAA was performed for the 2005 dataset, the most contemporary year of focus. One AOI was selected for each of the six countries studied. GEP imagery was available within two years of the temporal focus in nearly all cases, except Indonesia wherein the timeliest imagery was from 2012. Increasingly variable results were observed as mangrove cover became more open/sparse. Over-representation was identified in places, particularly where mangrove had been converted to palm oil plantations (e.g., in Malaysia), or clear-cut for agriculture (e.g., Malaysia and India). Whilst mangrove was generally well represented in India, Bangladesh, Myanmar and Indonesia, large stands were missing from Thailand and Malaysia. Dynamics for Bangladesh and Myanmar are presented in and were extracted from (J) [75] (Table 4, Figure 2 and Figure 4).(K) SPOT ‘Quick-look’ map for Bangladesh and Myanmar, Blasco et al. (2001) [76]The authors presented this study as the first nationwide estimate of Myanmar’s mangrove extent, with Bangladesh also mapped. The study referred to 150 ‘quick-look’ scenes from SPOT 1, 2 and 3 HRV sensors, for c. 1999, to produce mangrove classifications. Due to the modest performance of such a method, ‘quick-look’ scenes were cross-checked against SPOT1 HRV and RESURS genuine scenes from 1999, using a combination of visual interpretation and supervised classification methods (minimum distance and maximum likelihood [88]). Finally, field surveys were conducted across 25 check plots. The result was eight mangrove classes, expressed in the published findings as “dense”, “degraded” and “reforested”. The authors do not report on classification accuracy assessment or positional accuracy. Mangrove extent in Bangladesh amounted to 495,000 ha and in Myanmar 690,000 ha (Table 4). Given (K) [76] is a single-year dataset, QAA was not undertaken. The authors acknowledge limitations with use of ‘quick look’ data due to modest technical performance, and further investigation on their use is required. They also state that classification accuracy could be improved by 10% if NDVI and empirical thresholds were included. This dataset was not available/acquired.(L) National-level mapping of India’s mangrove forests from 1987 to 2017, Forest Survey of India (2017) [55]The Forest Survey of India (FSI) has been using remote sensing techniques to map the country’s forest extent (including mangroves) since 1987, on a two-year cycle. The first assessment was undertaken visually at 80 m spatial resolution (minimum mapping unit of 400 ha), using Landsat MSS imagery. FSI have gradually employed more sophisticated remote sensing methods, switching from visual to digital analysis, and utilising imagery from increasingly more modern Landsat and IRS sensors. The 2017 assessment used imagery from the IRS-Resourcesat-2 LISS-III sensor with a spatial resolution of 23.5 m. A hybrid methodology was employed in which unsupervised classification was aided by visual interpretation undertaken by expert analysts with a strong understanding of the local environment—although the authors state mangrove forest was classified separately owing to their distinct tone and texture in imagery, without detailing further. Three mangrove classes were produced: “Very Dense”, “Moderately Dense” and “Open”, generating a total extent of 492,100 ha for 2017 (up from 404,600 ha in 1987). This equates to a 0.6% increase per annum over this period (Table 4, Figure 2a). The FSI website provides further detail on their mapping efforts, although no error metrics or shortcomings are provided. The datasets were not acquired due to the associated cost, therefore QAA was not undertaken. Maps and data are available to purchase from their website [55].(M) Baseline mapping of aquaculture and coastal habitats, Clark Labs (forthcoming) [77]Clark Labs (Worcester, USA) [77] produced a baseline land-cover map for Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam to inventory pond aquaculture and coastal habitats using Landsat data circa 2014. Supervised classification techniques were applied to Landsat OLI scenes to generate 32 land-cover classes, including mangrove. Full methods, error metrics and shortcomings are to be reported in forthcoming publications. Mangrove extents for the four countries were extracted from data downloaded from the Clark Labs website [77], and are as follows: 29,089 ha in Cambodia, 604,057 ha in Myanmar, 259,678 ha in Thailand and 180,784 ha in Vietnam (Table 4, Figure 2a,b). With a pan-sharpened spatial resolution of 15 m, this dataset offers a superior resolution to the other datasets described (most are at 30 m), but is limited in its spatial and temporal coverage within the ROI. Given (M) [77] is a single-year dataset, QAA was not undertaken.(N) Mangrove forest maps over Myanmar for years 2000 and 2014, Estoque et al. (2018) [68]Estoque et al. [68] used Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI imagery to produce mangrove forest maps over Myanmar for years 2000 and 2014 to assess change in mangrove ecosystem services. The study employed the ISODATA algorithm to conduct an unsupervised classification, generating 200 spectral clusters to identify mangrove and non-mangrove classes. Visual assessment was undertaken using Google Earth imagery with the help of technical experts from Myanmar’s Forest Department. A classification accuracy assessment was based on the collection of 400 mangrove field validation points, plus 400 non-mangrove validation points from Google Earth to produce confusion matrices for map years 2000 and 2014. Overall accuracies were computed as 91% and 97% respectively. The authors do not report on positional accuracy of the maps. The study estimated Myanmar’s mangrove distribution to be 666,759 ha in 2000, declining to 475,637 ha in 2014, representing a 28.66% loss over the period [68] (Table 4, Figure 2a). The findings are further broken down by state. No notable shortcomings are reported by the authors. Due to the recent publication of this paper, the data was not acquired, therefore QAA was not conducted.(O) Mapping and monitoring the Philippines’ mangrove forests from 1990 to 2010, Long et al. (2014) [69]This study assessed Landsat TM and ETM+ imagery to produce mangrove distribution maps across the Philippines for years 1990, 2000 and 2010. Data and findings from a previous study (i.e., Long and Giri [89]) provided a distribution for 2000, based on an unsupervised classification which employed the ISODATA algorithm for 2000, whilst a supervised decision tree classification approach mapped distributions for 1990 and 2010. Three land-cover classes i.e., mangrove, water, terrestrial non-mangrove were generated. High resolution IKONOS and QuickBird data were used for validation purposes, and an accuracy assessment using stratified random sampling indicated a user’s accuracy of 99% and overall accuracy of 93%. The authors do not report on positional accuracy of the map. The study reported a nationwide baseline extent of 268,996 ha in 1990, 256,185 ha in 2000, and 240,824 ha in 2010, indicating a downward trend throughout the period, equaling a 10.5% decline (Table 4, Figure 2a and Figure 4). The authors state a need for future studies to address the misclassification of mangrove as water, particularly around small <900 m2 stands. This was cited as the most common classification error in this study. The data was not available/acquired, therefore QAA was not possible.(P) Creation of a forest map in Papua New Guinea, c. 2002, Shearman et al. (2009) [78]Shearman et al. [78] produced a land-cover map over Papua New Guinea (PNG) for c. 2002, as part of a study to quantify forest conversion and degradation in the country. Use of Landsat ETM+ scenes was supplemented by Landsat TM, SPOT 4 and 5 where adequately cloud-free ETM+ imagery could not be acquired. Due to the strong tendency for cloud-cover in PNG, imagery could not be acquired for a single year. 2002 is however the proposed imaged year, accounting for 62% of images used. Images were segmented into spectral clusters using ‘eCognition’ software and the resulting polygons classified through expert visual interpretation. This generated nine land-cover classes including mangroves. Validation was undertaken using low-flying aerial photographic surveys, and identified an overall image classification accuracy of 97.7%. The authors report the positional accuracy of imagery enabled change detection over areas spanning 60–100 m. National mangrove extent was estimated at 574,876 ha (Table 4, Figure 2a). However a lack of wall-to-wall coverage from a narrow period is likely to have undermined results, given the heterogeneous nature of forest change across tropical landscapes such as this [78,90]. However, similarly to (C) [73], forest was defined as having a canopy height of >5 m, which is likely to have under-represented lower-stature trees, including mangroves. Given (O) [69] is a single-year dataset, QAA was not undertaken. This dataset was not available/acquired.", 3. Results and Discussion, 3.1. Inventory and Description of Datasets,3
236,"Whilst studies (A), (B), (E), (F), (G), (I), (J), (K), (L), (M), (N), (O) and (P) report mangrove area in discrete terms i.e., presence or no presence, datasets (C), (D), (H) represent mangrove area using a continuous mangrove cover measure, reporting % forest canopy-cover. Measures of continuous cover result in reduced calculated area. In any given pixel, if mangrove is detected, a discrete measure is likely to represent the entire pixel’s area as mangrove e.g., 900 m2 out of 900 m2 represented as mangrove. A continuous mangrove cover measure will represent the pixel in terms of % canopy cover, which if 50% would equal 450 m2. This equates to a 450 m2 difference in that single pixel, resulting in significant discrepancy when assessed at the landscape-level. The presence of sparse or degraded mangrove forest accentuates this effect. This explains the difference in areal extent: figures reported by (C) [73] were on average 38% lower than those reported by (A) [33] for the same year of focus (2000). However another reason for this is likely the omission of mangroves <5 m in height, as per (C) [73]. When compared to (H) [31], figures reported by (D) [67] for the year 2012 were on average 31% lower per country. As well as being lower in absolute terms, rates of mangrove loss were on average roughly double those reported by (H) [31]. There remains a broader question on which measure is more suitable for calculating mangrove distribution. Hamilton et al. [60] propose that discrete, presence versus no presence pixel measures may be inadequate for applications such as establishing mangrove carbon stocks for programmes such as REDD.Regardless of the methodology adopted, defining mangrove area spatially is challenging as mangroves often co-exist with other similar coastal habitats (e.g., salt marshes and tidal freshwater forests) [30]. Numerous studies (e.g., [15,53,67,68,91,92]) have noted the lack of consistency in how mangroves are defined (e.g., mangrove forest only; mangrove habitat inclusive of water bodies). This reiterates the need to develop robust and standardised, well-reported methods for accurately quantifying mangrove distribution [89,91,92,93], and is highly likely to be somewhat responsible for the variability in areal estimates. Likewise, with regards to studies (A) [33] and (E) [53], which were intended to provide global baselines of mangrove distribution for 2000 and 2010 respectively, the papers or supporting material have not provided baseline breakdowns for all countries. Study (A) [33] published figures for the 15 most mangrove-rich countries in the world, whilst (E) [53] published mangrove extents for the top 10. In both cases full geospatial data has been made available on the UN Ocean Data Viewer [79], thus figures for all remaining countries are extractable as undertaken in this study (Table 4, Figure 2a,b). However, for both (A) [33] and (E) [53], in the absence of a full methodology explaining how country boundaries were determined, boundaries produced in this study were potentially defined using disparate approaches (e.g., input datasets; projections), resulting in discrepancies as high as 13% (A) [33] between reported values and extracted values (Table 3). This could have negative consequences on decision-making when used to inform intervention. It would be valuable to resource managers and decision makers for future (and existing) studies to present mangrove distributions by region, sub-region, country and country administrative boundaries e.g., provinces/districts—either in-paper or within supplementary materials. Universal use of an agreed and recognised high-resolution boundary dataset e.g., GADM v3.6 [64] could help facilitate this.Patterns of mangrove extent change can be drawn from the dynamics data. Of the 15 studies identified, only eight (C), (D), (G), (H), (J), (L), (N), (O) involved multi-year distributions/data from which mangrove dynamics could be calculated. Of the 25 countries/territories within the ROI, mangrove extents in Bangladesh, Brunei, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Thailand and Vietnam have remained relatively steady, exhibiting <3% loss over the time periods studied. Loss in countries and territories with mangrove area <10,000 ha (Maldives, Micronesia, New Caledonia, Palau, Singapore, Timor Leste and Vanuatu) was <2%, but only reported on by (H) [31] and/or (D) [67]. Both of these datasets report continuous rather than discrete mangrove distribution. Whilst this is pertinent for country comparisons in absolute terms (due to the comparatively low coverage of continuous coverage figures), in proportionate terms, when measuring % change between two points in time, the impact is likely to be minimal. Therefore whether a dataset reports coverage in discrete or continuous terms is not regarded as being of significance to the reliability of this dynamics assessment. It should also be noted that (H) [31] potentially underestimates mangrove distribution by only accounting for mangrove loss pixels from GFC (C) [73], and not mangrove gain pixels, whilst (D) [67] was found to under-represent low-stature mangrove forest in the QAA exercise. Both datasets also rely heavily on the MFW (A) [33] and GFC (C) [73] datasets in their methodologies, thereby introducing their respective shortcomings into these studies. Dynamics were not available for Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru and the Northern Mariana Islands. Furthermore, as most studies presenting dynamics have used temporal intervals of ten years or greater, it is difficult to understand intra-interval change. This makes it difficult to develop a clear understanding of the process of mangrove extent change, and as such more regular intervals (such as the annual global updates proposed in study (E) [53]) would assist in building up that understanding [61].Of all countries in the ROI, Myanmar exhibited the greatest rate of loss in mangrove extent. (J) [75] reported a 35% decrease from 1975–2005, whilst between 2000–2014 (N) [68] reported a 28.7% decline in distribution. The two studies combined represent a time period of approximately 40 years, thereby capturing longer-term change dynamics and trends. Furthermore, the findings from (N) [68] are backed up by strong results in accuracy assessments, and findings from (J) [75] are considered reliable given the QAA exercise that found mangroves in Myanmar to be generally well represented. Whilst studies based on continuous measures of mangrove forest cover reported a notable drop in the rate of overall deforestation from 2000, rates of mangrove loss of 5.5% from 2000–2012 [31] and 10.2% from 2000–2014 [67] are still comparatively high post-2000 when compared to other countries in the ROI.In India a 7.6% decline in mangrove distribution was reported from 2000–2012 (G) [19], again comparatively high for the period. However this figure was heavily influenced by the Sundarbans, the largest contiguous mangrove ecosystem in the world, of which 40% is in India. Literature indicates that the Sundarbans remained relatively stable between 1973 and 2000 with a reported loss in areal extent of approximately 1.2% [66]. The Indian Sundarbans represents approximately 50% of India’s total mangrove extent, thus it could be assumed that mangrove loss in India’s other mangrove habitats was significantly higher than the nationwide loss of 7.6% as reported by (G) [19]. This is backed up by Thomas et al. [36], who categorise Western India as a “hotspot of mangrove change […] which should be prioritised for future monitoring” by using multi-temporal radar mosaics as indicators of change. Conversely, Giri et al. (G) [19] also identify continuous mangrove gain between 1973–2011 when reporting on a case-study over Goa, an area of “substantial mangrove extent” within Western India. (L) [55] (a Government organisation responsible for the assessment and monitoring of forest resources) has identified a broadly upward trend in India’s mangrove extent since 1987. Their two-year cycle of remote sensing-based forest assessments has identified increases in national mangrove extent for 10 of 14 updates until 2017, representing a 21.6% gain between 1987–2017. Indeed the latest FSI [55] report in 2017 identified an 18,100 ha increase in mangrove extent since 2015’s assessment (a gain of 3.8%). (C) [73] noted in their Supporting Information that India reports “forest gains that are not readily observable in time-series satellite imagery, including this analysis”. However the FSI provides a comprehensive breakdown of change dynamics in each of the 12 coastal states, and furthermore dynamics for coastal districts within these states. FSI [55] cite widespread plantation efforts (also noted by Jayanthi et al. [54]) and natural regeneration as factors driving notable mangrove extent increases across five states. This upward trend is echoed by Jayanthi et al. [54], who used Landsat TM and ETM+ scenes to assess mangrove change in the ten largest mangrove forests in India between 1989 and 2013. Mangrove extent across the ten forests was estimated as increasing by 13.2%.Studies including the Philippines reported variable findings. (O) [69] reported a 10.5% loss in areal extent from 1990–2010, with mangrove reported as present or absent. Findings from (O) [69] are considered to be the most reliable indicator for the Philippines given its single-country focus, and strong performance in the study’s accuracy assessment. Studies using continuous mangrove cover as a measure reported very little loss, 0.5% from 2000–2012 [31] and 1.49% from 2000–2014 [67]. (O) [69] generated comprehensive nation-wide maps for 1990, 2000 and 2010 and identified a 6% loss from 2000–2010, thereby contradicting studies assessing loss using continuous measures. Indonesia has by far the greatest areal extent of mangroves (approximately 45% of mangroves found within the ROI, according to (A) [33]). The rate of loss in Indonesia was relatively low, estimated to be 3.86% between 2000–2014 [67] or as low as 0.46% between 2000–2012 [31]. This loss was not nearly as high as in Myanmar, however in absolute terms according to (D) [67] estimates, loss in Indonesia totalled nearly 100,000 ha from 2000–2014—more than a third of Myanmar’s total mangrove area in 2014.The rate of loss in Malaysia and Cambodia was not as pronounced as in Myanmar, but notable nonetheless. In Malaysia, loss was reported at 2.83% from 2000–2012 [31] and 5.58% between 2000 and 2014 [67]. In Cambodia, loss was reported at 2.28% from 2000–2012 [31] and 5.42% from 2000–2014 [67].There were difficulties associated with acquiring some of the datasets identified pertinent to this study, particularly those from studies published more than five years ago. In some cases data was provided without sufficient (or any) supporting information or metadata, including fundamental characteristics such as projection information. This undermined the process of describing inventoried datasets when information was not acquired or identified, and slowed down or halted efforts considerably. Online portals such as the UN Ocean Data Viewer [79] are valuable repositories of geospatial datasets pertaining to the management of coastal environments, but no single repository contains all or even most of the inventoried datasets for the ROI. Uploading additional pertinent historic and future datasets, with all accompanying metadata, would greatly support management efforts, and would improve the spatial and temporal coverage, and accuracy of future inventories, descriptions and comparisons of datasets.", 3. Results and Discussion, 3.2. Comparison of Datasets,3
237,"Of the three sub-regions in the ROI, SE Asia has exhibited the most mangrove loss. This finding is backed up by a recent study (i.e., Thomas et al. [36]) which employed methods similar to Lucas et al. [94] to identify mangrove change hotspots between 1996–2010. The study cites mangrove areas of SE Asia as having the highest prevalence of anthropogenic activity versus other regions in the world. When considering individual countries across the datasets inventoried and assessed, Myanmar and the Philippines stand out as mangrove loss hotspots. Myanmar experienced 35% loss between 1975 and 2005 [75] and 27.6% loss between 2000 and 2014 [68], eclipsing rates of loss seen anywhere else within the ROI. Between 2000 and 2012, Myanmar experienced a 5.5% loss [31] and from 2000–2014, a 10.2% loss [67]. Hamilton and Casey [67] cite Myanmar as “the current hotspot for mangrove deforestation”, referring to their MFW- and TEOW-derived products (see (D) to identify a rate of deforestation four times higher than the global average.The Philippines experienced 10.5% loss from 1990–2010 with relatively consistent rates across the two decades (O) [69]. Richard and Friess [31] and Hamilton and Casey [67] also estimated mangrove losses in the Philippines of 0.5% and 1.5% over their respective periods of study—both lower rates of loss attributed to the use of continuous rather than discrete measures.Secondary hotspot nations are considered to be Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia. Within SE Asia, after Myanmar, these were the next three countries with the greatest rates of mangrove loss as reported by Richards and Friess [31], with 2.8%, 2.3% and 1.7% lost respectively between 2000 and 2012. Hamilton and Casey [67] reported a similar pattern, albeit with higher rates of loss: Malaysia lost 5.6%, Cambodia lost 5.4% and Indonesia lost 3.9%.Dynamics in India warrant further investigation. Whilst India saw a 7.6% loss from 2000–2012 (above the average across the ROI), the loss appears to be lopsidedly occurring in other parts of India given the relatively well-preserved Indian Sundarbans [75]. Furthermore the conflicting findings for India at the national scale (as identified in this study) highlight the need for further and more regular remote sensing-based monitoring, from which reliable change dynamics can be extracted. Due to conflicting information, we cannot conclude that India is a mangrove loss hotspot. For smaller countries/territories within the ROI, mangrove change dynamics are lacking in the literature. For Guam, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru and Northern Mariana Islands, no change dynamics are available at all (and therefore excluded from Table 5). For eight others (including Papua New Guinea), only one set of change dynamics are available (from (H) [31]). Some of these countries may also be loss hotspots however in the absence of data this cannot be verified. The 2010 global baseline published as part of the Global Mangrove Watch initiative (E) [53] potentially heralds a new era of annual mangrove distribution updates. From this a reliable monitoring system is proposed by Bunting et al. [53], using a method that focuses on mapping changes away from the baseline rather than using independently classified baselines [86]). It will also rely upon improved sensors (e.g., Landsat OLI, Sentinel-2), which are rapidly accumulating collections. Furthermore, use of imagery from these sensors within cloud-based platforms (e.g., Google Earth Engine) again holds promise [95,96,97]. Indeed, studies (C) [73] and (G) [19] employed Google Earth Engine. Such solutions could provide much-needed coverage over countries currently lacking dynamics data and future research should be monitored closely.", 3. Results and Discussion, 3.3. Identifying Mangrove Loss Hotspots,3
238,"This report inventoried, described and compared seven single-date and eight multi-date datasets for 22 countries and three territories in S Asia, SE Asia and Asia-Pacific sub-regions. For all datasets, major limitations and challenges include the use of numerous definitions of ‘mangrove’ contributing to varying results; the lack of standardised and robust mangrove mapping methods (full methods are often not reported); a lack of coverage over much of the ROI; and the limited accessibility to many pertinent datasets. Despite these limitations/challenges, this inventory provides an important overview of what analysis of remotely sensed data has been conducted and the status of existing single- and multi-date datasets for the ROI. While single-date datasets are useful for providing snapshot distributions, they do not shed light on dynamics. In contrast, the comparison of multi-date datasets characterises regional change and identifies Myanmar as the primary loss hotspot. The Philippines, Malaysia, Cambodia and Indonesia follow Myanmar on a short-list of countries exhibiting highest rates of proportional mangrove loss across all inventoried multi-date datasets within the ROI. Future work can build on these results by acquiring and collating all available national and sub-national multi-date datasets for short-listed countries, conducting QAAs, and detailed deforestation analysis using best available or, if required, newly produced datasets. New mapping and monitoring efforts should take advantage of emerging cloud-based analysis platforms, such as Google Earth Engine. Efforts must also be taken to ensure all datasets are made available through online repositories with standardised metadata including details on projections, methods and accuracy. These measures will facilitate comprehensive and up-to-date assessments of dynamics. Accurate, detailed and timely dynamics information will help target loss hotspots within short-listed countries and guide intervention activities through programs such as the Blue Ventures (BV) Blue Forests (BF) project, which aims to support and enhance coastal livelihoods and safeguard biodiversity through the community-led restoration, conservation and managed-use of mangrove ecosystems within priority areas of mangrove loss. The BF project incentivises mangrove conservation through a range of community-led fisheries management, forestry, and alternative livelihood-based incentives, including harnessing international voluntary carbon markets to generate credits—and income—for communities from the avoided deforestation of carbon-rich mangrove forests. In Madagascar, the BF project is further augmented through its integrated People Health and Environment (PHE) design, a holistic approach integrating community health service delivery with marine conservation and coastal livelihood initiatives within mangrove-dependent communities. Alternative livelihood initiatives being developed within and adjacent to mangrove ecosystems as part of this model include community-based ranching of hatchery-reared sea cucumbers, and apiculture for honey production. Ongoing efforts to expand this initiative in mangrove ecosystems throughout Madagascar are working towards the establishment of the world’s largest mangrove conservation ‘blue carbon’ projects, an approach that BV is now replicating in the ROI. Results of this report are instrumental in informing country selection and prioritisation for replication efforts within this region. This includes informing international climate finance institutions of priority countries for investments in further ‘blue carbon’ mangrove conservation initiatives.", 4. Conclusions,None,4
239,"The forest ecosystem plays a critical role in the global terrestrial carbon cycle, and it is the research topic of major scientific projects, such as the International Geosphere-Biosphere Program, the World Climate Research Programme, and an International Programme of Biodiversity Science [1,2]. Forest biomass can directly reflect the status and changes of forest ecosystem, and it is the basis for the rational utilization of forest resources and for improving the ecological environment [3,4]. Accurate and rapid estimation of forest biomass is particularly important for improving the efficiency of time, capital, and labor of forest resource investigation and studying the carbon cycle of the terrestrial ecosystem in large areas [5,6].The traditional field measurement for forest aboveground biomass (AGB), which is more accurate for a small forest stand, cannot be used at the regional scale because it is too costly, labor intensive, and time consuming [7,8]. Remote sensing data, which have fast, real-time, dynamic, and regional-scale characteristics, are a frequently used data source for monitoring the dynamics of forests with the development of remote sensing technology [9,10]. Previous studies have shown that remote sensing data had a high correlation with AGB and can effectively predict and monitor forest biomass at the regional scale; thus, various types of remote sensing systems have been used for AGB estimation [11,12].Among all available satellites, Landsat is currently the only satellite program to provide consistent, cross-calibrated data spanning more than 40 years for global surface observation [13,14]. The advantages of the global coverage reflective with increasing spectral and spatial fidelity, the unique record of the land surface and its change over time, the 40+ year coherent and temporally overlapping observatories and cross-sensor calibration, and free and open data access policy greatly stimulate new science and applications of Landsat [15,16]. Many countries have used the Landsat archive to carry out institutional systematic mapping and monitoring of forests in large areas, e.g., Canada used Landsat TM and ETM+ data in 2002 to produce the Earth Observation for Sustainable Development map of forests [17]; Australia used Landsat 5 and 7 data for national-scale carbon inventories [18]; and Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research used Landsat data to monitor the annual deforestation rates of the Amazon since 1988 [19]. Landsat 8 was successfully launched on 11 February 2013, to ensure the continuity of the Landsat record. In addition to being consistent with the Landsat legacy, the significantly improved signal-to-noise ratio of Landsat 8 promises to enable better sensitivity of vegetation targets [16]. Therefore, Landsat 8 was used frequently to monitor the status, disturbance, and recovery of forests [20,21].For remote sensing-based biomass estimation, multiple types of variables such as spectral bands, vegetation indices, and texture measures can be used as predictor variables for modeling [22,23]. The previous studies have testified the importance of selecting appropriate variables in improving AGB modeling [24,25]. Variable selection (also known as feature selection) can select a most effective variable subset from the full variable set to reduce variable space dimension, and improve the generalization and intelligibility of the model [26]. Variable selection is one of the most important steps in AGB modeling. Stepwise regression, which is the most commonly used method of variable selection of linear regression model, is simple and easy to perform [27]. Many variable selection algorithms (such as the random forest algorithm) include variable ranking based on some evaluation strategies as a principal or auxiliary selection mechanism because of their simplicity, scalability, and good empirical success [28,29].In addition to variable selection, it is crucial to select a suitable algorithm to establish AGB estimation models. The traditional statistical regression algorithm, which can build a linear relationship between forest AGB and remote sensing data, is simple and easy to calculate. One of the traditional regression algorithms, the linear regression (LR) method was the most widely used method for AGB estimation in the previous studies [9,30]. However, the traditional statistical regression method cannot effectively express the complex relationship between forest AGB and remote sensing data under an indeterminate distribution of data. Therefore, the machine learning algorithms, such as K-nearest neighbor (KNN), support vector machine, artificial neural network, and decision tree, are applied to the remote sensing-based AGB estimation for improving the nonlinear estimation ability of the biomass model [31,32,33,34]. Previous studies have indicated that algorithms based on the decision tree, such as random forest (RF) and gradient boosting (GB), have an excellent performance in biomass estimation [35,36]. The RF is not only a variable selection algorithm but is also used as a nonlinear regression algorithm for AGB estimation because of its advantages of fewer adjustable parameters, high speed and efficiency, and the ability of variable importance calculation and permutation [37,38]. The extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), as an advanced GB system, is widely used by data scientists and has provided state-of-the-art results for many fields, especially the financial field, such as credit risk assessment [39], but its potential has not been fully utilized in forestry.The importance of field investigation for remote sensing-based AGB modeling is self-evident. Since 1973, China has conducted a continuous forest inventory, and in this process has established a comprehensive database covering many aspects of forest resources, involving forest health, timber production, and forest ecosystem services. The National Forest Continuous Inventory (NFCI), which is the first level of the forest inventory system of China, was designed to provide reliable data of the current status of and changes in the forests in the form of an integrated spatial database [40]. The NFCI survey is carried out every five years at the provincial scale. The sample plots have been systematically located at the graticule intersection of the national topographic map (scale of 1:100,000 or 1:50,000) [41]. Each tree with a diameter at breast height greater than or equal to 5 cm in the sample plot was tagged and permanently numbered for remeasurement in subsequent inventory periods. The NFCI is important for the formulation and refinement of state forest planning, management, and policy [42]. Therefore, the NFCI was widely used in many studies, including assessment and monitoring of forest status, conditions and changes, carbon sink and source identification, biomass estimation, and biodiversity [30,43].In this paper, we used the NFCI data and Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) data in combination with the LR and two machine learning algorithms, e.g., RF and XGBoost, to establish models for AGB estimation under the condition of known forest types and then created the AGB map for the study area using the optimal models. The specific objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to explore the influence of variable selection for the LR, RF, and XGBoost; (2) to validate the ability of the RF and XGBoost for estimating AGB; (3) to compare the accuracy of the LR, RF, and XGBoost models of different forest types; and (4) to draw the AGB map for the study area.", 1.

240,"Hunan Province (21.18 × 104 km2, 24°38′ N–30°08′ N, 108°47′ E–114°15′ E) is situated in the south-central region of China (Figure 1). Most of the study areas are located in a subtropical monsoon humid climate zone, and the annual average temperature, rainfall, and sunshine duration are 14.80–18.50 °C, 1200–1800 mm, and 1238.7–1868.7 h, respectively. Therefore, the abundant resources of sunlight, water, and heat, with rain and heat over the same period, can promote the rapid growth of trees and enhance the ability of natural regeneration. The forestland area is 13.00 × 104 km2, accounting for 61.37% of the study area; its forest coverage is 59.68%, and the total standing forest stock is 5.48 × 108 m3 [44]; it is one of the key forest areas and major timber production bases in Southern China.", 2. Study Area,None,2
241,"The eighth NFCI data of Hunan Province, which were surveyed in 2014, were used in this study. The size of each square plot is 25.82 × 25.82 m (approximately 0.0667 ha), and the plots were systematically allocated based on a grid of 4 km × 8 km. Note that the plots, which were situated on non-forestry land (such as cropland, water area, urban land, and bare land), or were covered by cloud in the remote sensing images, were eliminated. Finally, 3886 plots, which recorded around 149,000 trees, were used for modeling in this study (Figure 1).The AGB of a tree was calculated by using the general one-variable aboveground biomass model, which can be expressed as [45]:

The plot AGB was converted to per hectare biomass (Mg/ha).The plots were classified into three types, namely coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forest, based on the species standing volume according to the technical regulation for forest continuous inventory of China (Table 1). In general, the average AGB of all plots with non-classification of forest types (abbreviated as “All” in all tables and figures) was 50.06 Mg/ha, within the range of 5.48–268.60 Mg/ha, with a standard deviation of 35.34 Mg/ha; the average AGB values of coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forest were 48.71, 46.63, and 59.43 Mg/ha, respectively (Table 2).Compared with the digital elevation model, the high value of AGB is mainly distributed in the southeastern and western regions with a high altitude and steep slope and has a high vegetation coverage, low population density, less human interference, and poor economic condition. By contrast, the low value of AGB is mainly distributed in the low hills and valleys, with a low altitude and gentle slope; the conditions are opposite, especially in the middle region, which is the valley of Xiangjiang River with many towns and villages, and cropland. The spatial distribution trend of AGB is consistent with the topographic features and socio-economic conditions of the study area.", 3. Data, 3.1. Inventory Data,3
242,"The Landsat Surface Reflectance products, which were derived from Landsat 8 OLI satellite images, were used in this study. The images, which were acquired in October 2015, were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, accessed on 20 October 2019). There were 30 screen images (Figure 1).Radiometric and atmospheric correction of the Landsat Surface Reflectance images was performed by USGS [46]. For the areas of complex topography and with a great difference in elevation, terrain correction can effectively eliminate the shadow of the terrain as well as the difference in spectral features between a sunny slope and a shaded slope due to the topographic relief, preferably reflecting the true spectral feature of the object [47]. The terrain correction used the C-correction algorithm [48]. Then, the images were resampled to a pixel size of 25.82 m, the same as the inventory plot. The texture images were calculated using a grey-level co-occurrence matrix algorithm with 3 × 3, 5 × 5, and 7 × 7-pixel windows [49]. In addition, 20 vegetation indices were generated for this study (Appendix A). Landsat 8 OLI data were processed by the Environment for Visualizing Images software (Version 5.3.1, Boulder, CO, USA).Finally, the remote sensing predictor variables, which were extracted for each plot center, included the primal images of 6 Landsat Surface Reflectance band images as well as the generated images of 20 vegetation index images and 144 texture images (Table 3).", 3.

243,"The European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) project, of which the objective is to realize the full potential of the long-term global earth observation archives as a significant and timely contribution to the Essential Climate Variables databases required by United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, delivered consistent global Land Cover (LC) maps at a 300 m spatial resolution on an annual basis from 1992 to 2015 [50]. There is a highly positive result of the accuracy of the different classes: the highest user accuracy values are found for the classes of cropland (0.89–0.92), broadleaf forest (0.94–0.96), urban areas (0.86–0.88), bare (0.86–0.88), water bodies (0.92–0.96), and permanent snow and ice (0.96–0.97); the mixed and coniferous forest has a relatively low user accuracy value with 0.79–0.81 and 0.82–0.83, respectively [50]. The CCI-LC map for 2014 was downloaded from the ESA website (http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/index.php, accessed on 20 October 2019) for this study.The typology of CCI-LC was defined using the Land Cover Classification System developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, Rome, Italy. The map was consolidated into seven types based on the typology of CCI-LC: coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests, cropland, urban, water, and other types (non-forestry land, included bare land, grassland, etc.) (Figure 2). Then, the CCI-LC map was resampled to 25.82 m and snapped to the grid of Landsat 8 images.For validation of the accuracy and consistency of classification between NFCI and CCI-LC, the attribute of the CCI-LC map was extracted by the NFCI plot center. The result indicated that the producer accuracies of the CCI-LC map of coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests were 0.91, 0.88, and 0.82, respectively, and the user accuracies were 0.93, 0.91, and 0.92, respectively; the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of coniferous, broadleaf and mixed forests were 0.92 and 0.88, respectively (Table 4).

The RF and XGBoost models, two ensemble techniques that combine the separate decision tree models to improve the ability of models, were considered in this paper.RF is a classification and regression algorithm based on decision tree proposed by Breiman [51] in 2001. RF is one of the most common approaches to capture the complex relationship between a response and a set of explanatory variables with the following advantages: robustness to reduce over-fitting, ability to determine variable importance, higher accuracy, fewer parameters that need to be tuned, lower sensitivity to tuning of the parameters, fast training speed, and anti-noise property [25].RF randomly collects a new dataset from the original sample dataset by bootstrapping. Generally, about 2/3 of the original sample data are selected in one bootstrap sample, and the remaining 1/3 of the data are used as out-of-bag data. Then, each bootstrap sample is used to establish a corresponding decision tree and combines multiple trees to improve the prediction performance [51]. When RF was used for regression, the mean of all decision tree prediction results was taken as the final prediction result. RF has been applied extensively as a classification algorithm [52] and has been used for time series forecasting in large-scale regression-based spatial applications [25,53]. 4.1.3.

Unlike the independent decision trees of RF, XGBoost can correct the residual error to generate a new tree based on the previous tree [56].The advantages of XGBoost include [54]:(1)Using the second-order Taylor expression for the objective function, making the definition of the objective function more precise, and the optimal solution can be easily found;(2)The addition of a regularization term into the objective function to control the complexity of the tree to obtain a simple model and to avoid overfitting;(3)The use of sampling of the column feature to reduce the calculation amount and prevent overfitting; and(4)The use of an effective cache-aware block structure for out-of-core tree learning to parallel and distributed computing makes learning faster for hundreds of millions of examples.Generally, XGBoost is a highly scalable tree structure enhanced model, which can handle sparse and missing data well and can greatly improve the speed of the algorithm and compress computational memory in large-scale data training.", 4.

248,"Variable selection is the process of selecting the minimal and most effective variable subset from the original variable set to reduce the dimension of variable space and maximize the evaluation criteria [29]. Generally, the variable selection algorithm should determine four elements as follows: search starting point and direction, search strategy, evaluation function, and stopping criterion [57], but the algorithms mainly focus on the search strategy and evaluation function. In this paper, the stepwise regression approach was used to select the variable for LR, and the variable importance-based method was used for RF and XGBoost. 4.2.1. Stepwise Regression ApproachStepwise regression is an important analysis method in LR analysis, which is mainly used to solve the problem of how to select explanatory variables when the number of explanatory variables is too many in the LR model so that all explanatory variables significantly impact the response variable in the regression equation [27]. Stepwise regression is used to introduce the explanatory variables one by one into the regression equation according to the contribution for the response variable. An introduced explanatory variable will be removed from the regression equation if it becomes non-significant due to the introduction of the subsequent new explanatory variable. After each explanatory variable is introduced or excluded, the F-test based on the sum of squares of partial regression is performed to ensure that only significant explanatory variables are included in the regression equation. This process is repeated until no non-significant explanatory variables are selected in the regression equation and no significant explanatory variables are removed from the regression equation to ensure that the final set of explanatory variables is optimal.In this paper, stepwise regression was performed in SPSS software (Version 25, Armonk, NY, USA), and the probability of the F-test was set to 0.05 and 0.10 for entry and removal, respectively. 4.2.2. Variable Importance-Based MethodEach RF and XGBoost algorithm define two measures for variable importance, which can be used to rank variables. For RF, the first measure, which is computed from permuting out-of-bag data, is the percent increase in the mean square error (%IncMSE) of the prediction for each tree, and the second measure is the total decrease in node impurities (IncNodePurity) from splitting on the variable averaged over all trees, which is measured by the residual sum of squares [58]. Higher %IncMSE and IncNodePurity values indicate a more important predictor variable. For XGBoost, the first measure is calculated by the fractional contribution (Gain) of each feature to the model based on the total gain of this variable’s splits, and the second measure is calculated by the relative number (Frequency) of times a feature be used in trees [59]. A higher percentage of Gain and Frequency means a more important predictor variable.The acquisition of the optimal variable subset is a continuous search process, which would generally include four steps [60]:(1) Subset generation: generate a candidate variable subset according to a certain search strategy. In this paper, the generalized sequential backward selection approach was used. The start point of the search is the original full variable set. The dataset was input into the RF and XGBoost models to obtain the variable importance and descending order, respectively, according to the measures. Then, a certain number (10%) of variables, which were the most unimportant, were removed to generate a variable subset.(2) Subset evaluation: evaluate the prediction performance of the variable subset through an evaluation function. The generated subset was input into RF and XGBoost models, and the prediction accuracy was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2). In this paper, there were two evaluation results in each round, so the corresponding variable subset with high R2 was compared and then selected as the selected variable subset in this round.(3) Stopping criterion: determine when the variable search algorithm should stop. After the subset evaluation, the stopping criterion should be determined. If there is no stopping criterion, the search process cannot be stopped. In this paper, two stopping criteria were set: first if the number of variables of the subset was not larger than the set number, which was equal to the number of selected variables by stepwise regression for different forest types; and, second, if the R2 of the prediction of the subset did not improve for three consecutive rounds.(4) Subset validation: used to verify the validity of the selected variable subset. In this paper, a 10-fold cross-validation approach was performed to evaluate the performance of the variable subset in each round; therefore, the subset validation was not an independent step in the process.In this paper, the modeling and variable selection of RF and XGBoost were implemented by the R packages randomForest [58] and xgboost [59], respectively.

253," 5.1.1. Variable ImportanceThe result of the Pearson correlation coefficients between the predictor variables and AGB indicated that 144 variables had a significance level of 0.01 with the AGB, and the texture image variables had a significant correlation with the AGB. The variable with the highest correlation coefficient was B4T7Mea, with a value of −0.42.Twenty-nine LR models were established using the selected predictor variables by stepwise regression for three forest types (i.e., coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forest) and all plots with non-classification of forest types (Table 5). The results indicated that the performance of the models was improved when the count of predictor variables increased, and the models of different forest types worked better than the models of all forest plots (R2 values of models for the coniferous, broadleaf, mixed, and all forest plots were 0.32, 0.37, 0.34, and 0.30, respectively).The four best models (i.e., model numbers 7, 15, 21, and 29) were selected as the base to compare the performance of other types of models for the coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forest (Table 6). The predictor variables of the LR models were different, and the collinearity statistics of the predictor variables were less than 5.50, which showed that the selected variables were effective. The predictor variables of these models were dominated by the image texture information. The standardized coefficients and the significance levels of the models showed that the texture-type variables contributed more than other variable types, which indicated that the texture variables were very important for the AGB estimation using the LR model in this study.Figure 4 shows the selected predictor variables based on variable importance for the different forest types of RF and XGBoost models. The predictor variables of the RF and XGB models were not similar, and the main variables were the texture variables; the correlation and mean were included in all models, which indicated that the texture images had sufficient information to enhance the performance of models for AGB estimation. The texture of bands 5, 7, or both with a 7 × 7-pixel window were frequently involved in the models, indicating the significant roles of these two band texture variables in AGB estimation.However, the selected variables were different for the different forest types. The spectral bands, vegetation indices, and texture variables played a significant role in the broadleaf, mixed, and coniferous forest RF models, respectively. The species and canopy layers of broadleaf and mixed forests were multiple, which could be expressed by abundant spectral information; thus, the spectral and vegetation index variables could account sufficiently for the AGB estimation; the species composition of the coniferous forest was relatively single, which mainly consisted of fir and pine, and there was no obvious difference in the spectrum, whereas the texture information could well explain the AGB estimation [24,63]. This phenomenon of variable selection is more obvious in RF models than in XGBoost models. Unlike RF models, besides the texture variables, the spectral variables were also important for XGBoost models; especially Band4, which was the most important variable in all XGBoost models. Previous studies have shown that Band4, where the chlorophylls have peak absorption, had a strong relationship with biomass [64].In addition, the relationship between the selected predictor variables was calculated using the Pearson correlation coefficient. We found that RF models mostly split the importance among the correlated multiple variables, whereas XGBoost models are inclined to centralize the importance at a single variable. For example, Band4 was significantly correlated with VARI at a significance level of 0.01 with a value of −0.77; they had a similar importance in the RF model, but the importance was concentrated on Band2 in the XGBoost model for the coniferous forest. This conclusion is the same as that reported by Freeman et al. [65]. 5.1.2. Variable InteractionsThe result indicated, surprisingly, that Band4, VARI, or both were involved in almost models, especially in XGBoost models (Figure 4). Figure 5 shows how Band4 and VARI interact for the AGB estimation of the XGBoost models. We did not find significant interaction effects in these models, but we did find subtle interactions. These figures show that Band4 mainly affected the interval with a low value (<300), but the effect of VARI was different. For the model of the coniferous forest, the high values of predicted AGB were mainly concentrated in the interval with a low value of VARI (<0.0), and there were some significant differences with the adjacent interval. In contrast, the high values of predicted AGB were dispersed in all intervals of VARI with a low interval of Band4, but there were hardly any high values in other intervals for the model of the broadleaf forest. However, the effects of VARI and Band4 for the mixed forest model were significantly different from the models of the coniferous and broadleaf forests. Although the high values of predicted AGB were also concentrated in the interval with high values of VARI (>0.4), there were many higher values of predicted AGB that were distributed in other intervals of Band4. For the model of all forest plots, the effect of Band4 and VARI was more similar to the combination of the models of coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests.The interaction plots examine the effects of the two predictor variables with the remaining variables fixed at their mean value for continuous predictors (or the most common value for categorical predictors). The plots illustrated that they were seemingly more dependent on VARI than Band4 in these two-way interactions, although Band4 was the most important predictor in the estimation models. Compared with the model of all forest plots, each model of the coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests has distinct characteristics, which is beneficial for establishing AGB models with a high accuracy. 5.1.3. Performance of Variable SelectionThe forward selection approach, which increases variables step-by-step, was used in stepwise regression; whereas the backward selection approach, which deletes variables step-by-step, was used in the variable selection of RF and XGBoost models. For the LR models, the performance of the models was improved when the number of predictor variables increased (Table 5).Figure 6 illustrates how the R2 values change with the number of selected variables for RF and XGBoost models. Each line represents an independent model, and the different colors indicate the different forest types. The result indicated that the R2 values of models increased when the number of predictor variables decreased. Generally, the most dramatic change was the line of the mixed forest, followed by the lines of coniferous and broadleaf forests, whereas the line of all forest plots exhibited the smallest change in both RF and XGBoost models, although the variation degree of each line was different between RF and XGBoost models.Contrasting the lines of the two algorithms, besides that the performance of XGBoost was better than that of RF, the influence of the number of predictor variables on the performance of models was also different. For RF, the influence of the number of predictor variables was relatively low, which manifested in a smooth change of the lines, whereas the influence was dramatic for XGBoost, with jagged peaks and valleys of the lines. This also indicated the variable selection was more important for XGBoost than for RF.", 5. Results, 5.1. Role of Predictor Variables,5

257,"After the variable selection, we obtained the 12 best models of LR, RF, and XGBoost for different forest types. The performance of models was expressed by scatterplots, which showed the relationship between the predicted AGB values and observed AGB values (Figure 7). The plots showed that the RF model worked better than the LR model, and the XGBoost model worked better than the RF model for the same forest type. The results also indicated that the model of the broadleaf forest had the highest accuracy, followed by the models of mixed and coniferous forests, whereas the performance of the model for all forest plots was the worst for the same algorithm.We found that problems of underestimation and overestimation, which also existed in the previous studies, were experienced by all models [30,66,67]. Intuitively, the predicted value was higher than the centerline when the biomass was low but lower when it was high in the figures. This means that the problem of overestimation and underestimation of remote sensing AGB estimation had no a fundamental solution, although the performance of models had a significant improvement based on forest type.To further verify whether the models differed significantly, the F-test was used (Figure 8). The confidence level was set at 95%. In Figure 8, the numbers are the p-values, which are from the F-test, and the color of the checkerboard shows the levels of significance. The F-test results showed that there were significant differences of the predicted AGB between the LR, RF, and XGBoost models at a confidence level of 95%, although the p-values were different for these models (especially the p-value of all forest plots, which was higher than that of the other models).", 5.

258,"Finally, we drew the two AGB maps for the study area using the XGBoost models: first by estimating the AGB of the coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed forests according to the forest types in Figure 2, then combining these into one map (Figure 9a); second by estimating the AGB using all plots with non-classification of forest types (Figure 9b).In Figure 9, two maps of AGB had a similar trend in spatial distribution, which is consistent with the AGB distribution trend of the inventory plots in Figure 1. The results indicated that the ranges of predicted AGB for the two maps were different. The values ranged from 3.10 to 235.50 Mg/ha with a mean of 53.84 Mg/ha for the AGB map based on the forest type (Figure 9a), and the distribution and range of values were in close proximity to the inventory values in Figure 1. However, the range of values was from 6.50 to 210.30 Mg/ha with a mean of 52.39 Mg/ha for the AGB map based on all plots with non-classification of forest type (Figure 9b). In addition, the values of AGB in Figure 9a were higher than those in Figure 9b in the same area with a high value and were lower in the same area with a low value. This indicated that the ability of AGB estimation based on forest type was clearly improved for the high and low values. This improvement is also what we expected.The degrees of overestimation and underestimation of the two maps were different, although the problems of overestimation and underestimation still existed. To further verify this conclusion, we sorted the values of the predicted AGB into three ranges based on the distribution of values: low (3 < predicted AGB < 25), medium (25 ≤ predicted AGB < 65), and high (65 ≤ predicted AGB < 236) values (Figure 10). The corresponding values of predicted AGB for the two maps and the AGB difference (Figure 9a minus Figure 9b) were obtained by the overlaying operations. In the low range of predicted AGB, most of the values of AGB prediction based on forest types (abbreviated as “Classification” in Figure 10) were lower than the values of AGB prediction of all plots with non-classification of forest type (abbreviated as “Non-classification” in Figure 10), and the values of the difference were mainly distributed from −10 to 2 Mg/ha (Figure 10a); therefore, the “Classification” map had a better prediction performance. In the medium range, the distribution of the AGB difference approximated a normal distribution, indicating that two maps had a similar performance for medium values of AGB (Figure 10b). In the high range, the values of “Classification” were clearly higher than those for “Non-classification”, indicating that the “Classification” map also had better performance with respect to the high AGB values (Figure 10c). In summary, the map, which was predicted based on forest type, better estimated the AGB value than the map with the non-classification of forest type irrespective of high or low AGB.", 5. Results, 5.3. Mapping AGB,5
259,"Through this experiment, we increased our understanding of the importance of variable selection, which can influence the performance of machine learning algorithms. Variable selection is one of the most important processes in modeling, which can reduce data dimension and the storage space of data, speed the estimation process, and improve the interpretability and performance of models [29].Multiple predictor variables, such as spectral bands, vegetation indices, and textures, were extracted from remote sensing images and were used for modeling AGB in this paper. However, these predictors cannot all be used for modeling due to their high correlations and high numbers. The performance of models was significantly impacted by the number of selected predictor variables (Figure 6, Table 5). Through the variable selection, the number of predictor variables was reduced from hundreds to several, which makes it easier to interpret the model. In this study, the Red (Band4), NIR (Band5), SWIR (Band7) bands, and the derived variables played a more important role than other bands. In models of AGB estimation, the SWIR band is more sensitive to the shadow of vegetation and humidity of soil and is less influenced by the atmospheric conditions [16,22,68]; the NIR band of Landsat 8, of which the wavelength range was adjusted to 0.845–0.885 µm to exclude the effect of water-vapor absorption at 0.825 µm, is more sensitive to vegetation of different types [13,69]; and the red band is usually used to distinguish the vegetation type [21,64,70]. We cannot ignore the fact that the vegetation index variables were also selected frequently, especially VARI, which exists in all XGBoost models. Compared with other vegetation indices, VARI is minimally sensitive to the atmospheric effect, and the estimation error of vegetation affected by the atmosphere is less than 10% in a large area [71,72].In addition, the textures, which are dominant in all models, were also critical for AGB estimation, although the importance of the texture predictor variables was different from that in previous studies [24,30,66]. However, for the different forest types, texture variables and spectral variables played different roles in AGB models (Figure 4). For example, the spectral variables were more important than texture variables in the RF model of the broadleaf forest, while the texture variables were more important in the RF model of the coniferous forest. This illustrated that the role of texture variables and spectral variables was dependent on forest structure: in the broadleaf and mixed forest with multiple species and complex structure, the models tended to select the spectral variables, while in the coniferous forest with relatively fewer species and simple structure, the models tended to choose texture variables [63,64,73].Due to the different characters between spectral variables and texture variables, their combination is beneficial to improve the performance of AGB models, and this improvement was evident in all models. Moreover, the influence of variable selection was different for RF and XGBoost. We found that the accuracy of the XGBoost algorithm varied greatly with the number of selected variables compared with RF (Figure 6). The RF algorithm can be regarded as a parallel ensemble algorithm because the decision tree of RF is independent; thus, RF is not sensitive to inclusion of the noisy predictor variables [74,75], whereas the decision tree of XGBoost is generated based on the previous tree; thus, the noisy predictor variables will influence the accuracy of the subsequent new tree [76,77].The LR algorithm, which assumes a linear relationship between predictor and predicted variables, was used frequently in most early biomass estimation studies due to the interpretability of LR [30,78]. However, the relationship between remote sensing data and AGB is complex; thus, the traditional statistical regression algorithm cannot efficiently describe the relationship between them. Therefore, machine learning algorithms such as random forest and gradient boosting, which can establish a complex non-linear relationship between vegetation information and remote sensing images with an indeterminate distribution of data, were introduced to improve the accuracy of AGB estimation [79].In our study, we extracted 170 predictor variables from Landsat 8 images; then, a few variables were selected from these through the variable selection process to build RF and XGBoost models (Figure 4). We found that the machine learning algorithms prevented overfitting and significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the LR models, and the result also indicated that the XGBoost model worked better than the RF model (Figure 7). The XGBoost algorithm, which is a highly flexible algorithm with the ability to correct the residual error to generate a new tree based on the previous tree, provided an improvement in processing a regularized learning objective to avoid overfitting [54].Before this study, few studies had used the XGBoost algorithm to estimate AGB. Li et al. [30] used a linear mixed-effects model and linear dummy variable model to estimate AGB in the western Hunan Province of China; the R2 values of total vegetation were 0.41; Zhu et al. [6] used multiple algorithms (LR, KNN, logistic regression) to estimate AGB for the Xiangjiang River, and the results indicated the machine learning algorithm had a good performance for AGB estimation. In contrast, the results obtained by machine learning methods in this study were better, and the XGBoost algorithm had a good performance in AGB estimation and could reduce underestimation and overestimation to some extent.In this paper, we established the models based on forest type to improve the accuracy of AGB estimation, and the results indicated this method was valuable. We found that the models based on forest type had a better performance at the lower and higher values compared to the models of all plots with non-classification of forest types, especially XGBoost (Figure 7 and Figure 9). In addition, the problem of overestimation and underestimation, which are the main factors influencing AGB modeling performance, was not completely solved, although the performance of models had a significant improvement compared with the previous studies. As to this problem, it is decided by the algorithm itself on one hand. The decision trees, which are the key components of the RF and XGBoost methods, cannot extrapolate outside the training set. On the other hand, it is related to the remote sensing data. For plots with low AGB values, the shrubs, grass, and bare soil will influence the reflectance of bands; the pixel of Landsat 8 with relatively low spatial resolution (30 × 30 m) is a mixed pixel, which cannot accurately express the spectral information of land cover. For plots with high AGB values, the saturation in multispectral sensors such as Landsat 8 OLI is the main reason for underestimation of AGB [80,81]. Therefore, remote sensing data with higher spatial and radiometric resolution such as LIDAR data and hyperspectral data, or the approach of mixed pixel decomposition, may be solutions for AGB estimation. Meanwhile, a modeling approach based on the AGB range may be a useful method for improving the prediction of AGB, but it needs more sample plots.The subtropical forests of China are distributed in 13 provinces, including Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Yunnan. They are one of the dominant distribution areas of forest resources in China. It is necessary to monitor the subtropical forest change because the forests have been influenced by the improved silviculture, woody encroachment, climate change, and human activities. The forest biomass estimation based on traditional field measurements is a relatively accurate method, but it is impossible to implement for such large areas of subtropical forests. Therefore, remote sensing-based estimation of forest biomass change is a very important method. The NFCI data, which has been checked and revised many times by the state and provincial forest departments before it is released, is the only available data with highest quality in the provincial scale at present. However, the residual atmospheric effects and calibration errors in satellite data cannot be completely eliminated. Therefore, until the more effective satellite data are available, we can only hope to improve the accuracy of forest biomass estimation by using new modeling methods. Despite certain inaccuracies, the performance of the biomass estimation method used in this study exceeds our expectations, and the selected modeling method of XGBoost seems to be more effective. The results show that the NFCI data in combination with Landsat 8 can be successfully applied to biomass estimation. Although the XGBoost models had the relatively high RMSE and RMSE% values, the total accuracies of models were significantly increased with the variable selection, and it is still manifested that the methods in this paper were very important and useful for the provincial-scale accurate estimation of forest biomass, and these methods can also be used to other similar areas. In addition, we must admit that there are still many sections that could be improved in our research, such as methods of variable selection, variable data cleaning, and parameter optimization for machine learning. We will do further research in these aspects in the future.", 6. Discussion,None,6
260,"In this study, we selected the subtropical region of Hunan Province, China, as a case study area to analyze the AGB estimation based on forest type using different modeling algorithms, namely, LR, RF, and XGBoost. The results indicated the following: (1) Variable selection is a very important part of machine learning algorithms. In this study, variable selection had a significant effect on the performance of XGBoost compared with that of RF. (2) Machine learning algorithms have advantages in AGB estimation. In this paper, the XGBoost and RF models significantly improved the estimation accuracy compared with the LR models, and the XGBoost algorithm reduced overestimation and underestimation to a certain extent, although the problem was not fully eliminated. (3) The method of AGB estimation based on forest type is a very useful approach to improve the accuracy of AGB estimation, and the models had a better performance at the lower and higher values compared with the models using all plots with non-classification of forest types. In this paper, we provided a new approach when establishing similar models. The result and conclusion may be different for other areas, but we hope to pay attention to variable selection when using machine learning algorithms in the future and will try to use various remote sensing data and algorithms to improve the accuracy of biomass estimation.", 7. Conclusions,None,7
261,"The majority of India’s population (60%) depends on the agricultural sector for their livelihood [1]. Agriculture depends mainly on monsoon rainfall, surface water and ground water irrigation. Since the variability of monsoon rainfall is high, it forces the south Indian farmers to adapt their irrigated areas to local water availability [2]. Irrigated crop production is a major contributor to the green revolution, which has enabled the country to be self-sufficient [3], accompanied by fertiliser application and other inputs in semi-arid parts of India. Timely fertiliser application with water supply is essential for a successful crop. Spectral data from Remote Sensing (RS) have been studied for many years for an adequate assessment of nutrient and water variability for yield optimisation [4,5,6]RS can be an effective tool in monitoring crop production [7,8,9] and estimating yield [10,11]. Early estimation of yield may allow better planning and forecasting the market prices and support food security based on the regional, national and global demand and supply. RS allows collecting information about crop production using non-destructive methods [12] on a large scale for many fields at the same time. Hyperspectral (HS) RS provides continuous narrow spectral data from 400 to 2500 nm and have been proved to capture the variations in spectral response of the crop for the detection of nitrogen (N) content [13,14], biomass [15] and water stress [6,16]. Development of HS sensors and their application in estimating crop biomass from multi-year data [17] has gained increasing attention in the recent years. Multi-temporal images provide more information on vegetation phenology under wet and dry conditions than a single image [18]. Many studies related to multi-temporal hyperspectral imaging have been published on crops such as rice (Oryza sativa L.) [19], wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) [20,21] and maize (Zea mays L.) [10]. Besides maize, lablab (Lablab purpureus L.) and finger millet (Eleusine coracana L.) are primary crops in the semi-arid region of South India. The state of Karnataka generates the major share of lablab (90%) [22] and finger millet (62.01%) [23] production of India. However, well-defined multi-year studies on the estimation of biomass for maize, lablab and finger millet using multi-temporal hyperspectral data under varying nitrogen (N) fertiliser and water supply levels are still lacking.The aim of this study was to assess the potential of terrestrial hyperspectral imaging for the estimation of monsoon crop biomass based on data from three years (2016–2018). The specific objectives of the study were: (1) to develop statistical models to predict the fresh matter biomass (FMB) of the three crops: lablab, maize and finger millet; (2) to assess the effect of different levels of N and water supply on the predicted FMB value and for a wide range of crop phenology over the complete growing period; and (3) to evaluate the importance of spectral regions in the resulting models and understand the causal relationships of the model.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
262,"Two experiments were established with different irrigation regimes: rainfed (R) and drip irrigated (I). Each year has two cropping seasons, namely rainy/monsoon season (July–November) and dry season (February–May). Even in the monsoon season, drip irrigation systems are common, as the southwest monsoons are getting increasingly unreliable and timely irrigation enhances the crop productivity. In the rainy season, lablab (cultivars: HA 4 and HA 3), maize (cultivars: Nithyashree and NAH 1137) and finger millet (cultivars: GPU-28, MR-6 and ML-365) were cultivated in both experiments (Table A1) [26,27,28,29,30]. The fertiliser application was done by broadcasting at three levels to all crops. At high levels, the complete 100% application of N (recommended dosage) was applied and a reduced amount was applied at medium and low levels, which varied across the years. To lablab, the complete N dosage was applied at the time of sowing and for maize and finger millet it was split into two halves, i.e. at the time of sowing and four weeks after sowing (top dressing) with the objective of supplying nitrogen to growing plants in the readily available form and avoid leaching losses by heavy rainfalls, which frequently occur after sowing. Phosphorous and potassium were applied completely to all crops at the time of sowing (Table A2).Each block of a particular crop had three experimental plots (6 m × 12 m) with three N levels (low, medium and high) distributed in a randomised block design (Figure 1). In this split plot experiment, each plot was subdivided into two sub plots (6 m each), one was used for destructive biomass sampling (S) and the other one was used for non-destructive spectral measurements (H). In total, 36 plots (3 crops × 4 blocks × 3 fertiliser levels) were used for the spectral and biomass sampling (Figure 1).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Experimental Site,2
263,"Three hyperspectral images were taken in each H subplot using the full-frame hyperspectral camera UHD 185-Firefly [31] mounted on a terrestrial tripod. The distance between the camera and the plant canopy height was 1.5 m throughout the growth of the crop to cover the same area of approximately 1 m² in all images. The camera measured the spectral range from 450 to 998 nm, of which the wavelength between 470 and 950 nm was further analysed, as the signal-to-noise ratio was too low for the wavebands from 450 to 470 and 950 to 998 nm. The spectral range was divided into 121 bands with a band width of 4 nm. The focal length of the camera was 12.1 mm with the image size of 50 × 50 pixels covering the area of 1 m × 1 m at the applied height (2 cm spatial resolution). Prior to the measurement, the camera was calibrated using a dark (cap covering the lens) and white reflectance plane (95% reflectance Zenith Lite) [32] to calculate reflectance directly from the measured radiance. Although light conditions varied throughout the three years due to different illumination angles, the goal was to keep it as constant as possible. During the calibration in the field, the integration time was automatically obtained. The spectral reflectance of each pixel was normalised by dividing with the maximum reflectance value of the same pixel to reduce temporal variation and random noise [33].Each image contained non-vegetation elements such as soil, drip irrigation pipes and shadows. To reduce the effect of these elements, a two-step procedure was applied (Figure 2). First, the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [8] was calculated as the difference between reflectance in the red (620–750 nm) and near-infrared (NIR) (750–1400 nm), divided by the sum of reflectance in the red and NIR spectral range. Second, a two-class k-means clustering algorithm was applied to separate vegetation and non-vegetation using the NDVI values. The two class centroids were identified based on NDVI values in such a way that the distance between the centroids were minimised. Finally, only the pixels classified as vegetation were used to calculate the average spectral reflectance for each image. The three images collected in each plot were averaged resulting in one spectral reflectance curve per H subplot and sampling date.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Spectral Data Measurements,2
264,"The fresh matter weight of 2–4 plants were measured in the field and extrapolated to 1 m². The maximum number of samples collected for a particular crop type in a particular growing season was 60 (5 sampling dates × 3 fertiliser treatments × 4 replicates), but the number of sampling varied among the three years (Table 2).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Biomass Sampling,2
265,"In 2016 (Y1), the sampling was done on five sampling dates (Y1S1–Y1S5) in both irrigation regimes (R and I) for the three crops. Rainfed maize at the final sampling date in 2016 (Y1S5) was not sampled due to technical difficulties with the sensor. In 2017 (Y2), there were five sampling dates (Y2S1–Y2S5) for lablab, four for maize (Y2S1–Y2S4) and three for finger millet (Y2S1–Y2S3) in both irrigation regimes (R and I). In Y2, irrigated maize top-dressing fertilisation was mixed up for a few low, medium and high plots and hence the plots I07, I08, I09, I13, I14, and I15 (Figure 1c) were eliminated from analysis for Sampling dates 2–4 (Y2S2–Y2S4). In 2018 (Y3), there was one sampling date (Y3S1) for all three crops. Assessment of phenological stages of the crop was carried out by recording the morphological characteristics of the plants according to Biologische Bundesanstalt, Bundessortenamt und Chemische Industrie (BBCH) [34]. In total, there were 11 sampling dates (BBCH 1–8) for 2016–2018 (Table A3).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Sampling Dates,2
266,"To predict the fresh matter biomass (FMB) from reflectance data, machine learning random forest regression (RFR) in caret package [35] was used [36]. Although RFR does not require normal distribution of the FMB dataset, the original dataset was skewed towards one side. Hence, the FMB measured in the S subplots were cube root transformed to assure normal distribution of the dataset. RFR is a regression tree technique, which builds multiple decision trees and ensembles them for an accurate prediction [36]. It is less sensitive to overfitting as the subsets are drawn randomly each time. The regression trees has the ability to deal with complex relationships between variables for large datasets [37]. Each crop was modelled separately for R and I experiment based on three years datasets (6 models). Further, the datasets from both irrigation regimes on each crop were combined to give one Generalised model to check the robustness of the model independent of water supply. To eliminate the bias involved in splitting the data into training and testing sets, 100 different random subsets (75% for training and 25% for testing) were generated based on the sampling dates for each crop separately. Using these random subsets, 100 RFR models were calibrated and validated to predict the FMB for each crop from reflectance data. All machine learning methods have specific configuration parameters called tune parameters or hyperparameters, which optimise the performance of the predictive modelling algorithm [38]. For RFR model, two tune parameters need to be determined, i.e. number of trees and mtry. The number of trees parameter was always kept to a default value of 500 and the mtry parameter value was tuned using the repeated cross-validation (five-fold, three repeats) procedure. The mtry parameter value was set between 1 and 15 and the optimum mtry parameter for each model was identified. The model estimation accuracy of FMB was evaluated using R² validation (R²val) (Equation (1)) [39], the root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) (Equation (2)), and the relative root mean square error prediction (rRMSEP) (Equation (3)).

267,"To develop a prediction model for FMB, which is valid for varying conditions, individual FMB models were developed for two irrigation regimes (i.e., R and I) and a combination of the datasets of both irrigation regimes (i.e., Generalised model). The prediction accuracy of the FMB models varied between the crops and depended on the dataset (R, I, or Generalised) used for model development (Figure 5). The lowest rRMSEP value nearing to zero was considered as a better model. Building the RFR models separately for both R and I treatments, the lowest median rRMSEP for lablab was found in I with 17.9% (R²val = 0.34) and for maize and finger millet in R experiment with 18.5% (R²val = 0.60) and 19.8% (R²val = 0.46), respectively. With the combined dataset, the rRMSEP for lablab was 13.9% (R²val = 0.53), for finger millet was 18% (R²val = 0.46) and for maize was 18.7% (R²val = 0.53). Overall, compared to the experiment-wise modelling approach, model accuracy (in terms of rRMSEP) was higher for all crops when models were built with data from both water supply levels.In RFR modelling, the mtry parameter indicates the number of input variables randomly chosen at each node. Optimum mtry values (best tune values) were found to be 13, 7 and 7 for lablab; 8, 12 and 13 for maize; and 8, 2 and 7 for finger millet, respectively, for the Rainfed, Irrigated and Generalised models.The plots of fit for the 100 randomised Generalised models of the three crops are shown in Figure 6. The randomised models were based on stratified (according to sampling date and fertilisation rate) randomly selected samples for the calibration and validation dataset. Having considered these random effects in RFR modelling, it becomes obvious that predictions show a substantial underestimation with increasing FMB values (Figure 6).", 3. Results, 3.1. Crop Specific FMB Models,3
268,"The normalised deviation of predicted and measured biomass was used to check if the prediction accuracy of Generalised models varied among the three levels of N application (Figure 7). Overall, only minor deviations were found among low, medium and high levels of N supply for all crops between 2016 and 2018.Prediction accuracy of Generalised models varied strongly among the sampling dates (Figure 8). While in Y1, normalised deviation for lablab showed an irregular pattern, such as an overestimation (Y1S1 and Y1S3), underestimation (Y1S2) and good concordance (Y1S4 and Y1S5). A decreasing trend of deviation was observed with increasing crop maturity in Y2. With maize, there was a general decline across sampling dates both in Y1 and Y2. With finger millet, there was overestimation for the early sampling dates (Y1S1–Y1S2 and Y2S1–Y2S2) followed by decreasing underestimation for the later sampling dates in 2016 (Y1S3–Y1S5). Following this deviation, it can be concluded that crop phenology influenced model performance with a tendency towards overestimation at early stages and an underestimation at later stages of crop growth.No systematic over- or underestimation was found for biomass prediction of the three crops at the two levels of water supply (Figure 9). Hence, model prediction was rather robust with slightly larger deviations for lablab at both water supply levels as compared to the other crops.", 3. Results," 3.2.

269,"The wavelengths of the crop helped in differentiating and identifying the crop traits based on their spectral region. The best model was identified out of 100 Generalised models on each crop based on the lowest RMSE value. From the best model, the wavelengths contributing above 75% in the prediction of FMB were identified, as shown in Figure 10. For lablab, it was found that a multitude of spectral bands from the green, red and near infrared (NIR) region (546–910 nm) contributed significantly to the estimation of biomass. Contrastingly, for maize, only wavelengths in the NIR region (750–794 nm) and for finger millet in both the red and NIR region (686, 694, and 774–814 nm) were important.", 3. Results, 3.3. Importance of Wavelengths,3
270,"The aim of the study was to estimate the monsoon crop biomass for three crops (lablab, maize and finger millet) based on terrestrial hyperspectral imaging during crop growth season across three years (2016–2018). With a high number of samplings during three consecutive monsoon seasons, a wide range of phenological stages of crops could be covered. This is an important issue considering the validity range of prediction models, since the harvest time of crops varies considerably in agricultural practice, for example due to nutrient and water availability and moisture content of grains. Thus, by our deliberate multi-temporal approach, the validity range of Generalised models was significantly broadened, which was further enhanced by the integration of crop measurements under a wide range of N fertiliser and water supply.The FMB models were developed based on the predicted FMB values and tested with the observed FMB values for validation. Overall, the results indicate that the Generalised models had higher estimation accuracy (with rRMSEP ranging from 13.9% to 18.7%) for all the three crops, as compared to the rainfed and irrigated models. One reason may be that, with the combination of data from two experiments, representing severe water limitation (Rainfed experiment) and optimum water supply (Irrigated experiment), the range of crop productivity became much broader, which eventually may have increased the robustness of regression models.Similar prediction errors were found in a previous study for maize biomass by RGB images (relative error 16.66%, R² = 0.78) [40]. In contrast to our study, their models included canopy height parameter additional to RGB information, which shows the promising potential of structural data calculated with photogrammetric methods particularly when they are combined with data from other sensor types [11,41,42]. Although spectral information was limited to the Red Edge Modified Ratio Index (REMRI), the combination of spectral data with LiDAR-derived metrics produced only a slightly smaller error in the estimation of maize biomass [10] as compared to our study. However, as the sampling was done at only one date of one single year and because no defined N and water supply was applied, the transferability of such modelling approaches beyond the study area may be limited.Although lablab is an important legume in the food and cattle production system in India, this plant has not been subjected to any remote sensing assessment this far. The fact that it was the least productive crop in both experiments across all years, strongly reduced the range of FMB values for model calibration. However, the highest prediction errors obtained were between those of the more productive crops maize and finger millet. Similarly, finger millet is a rarely researched crop in terms of remote sensing. In a single-year satellite-based study with pearl millet, which exhibits a similar growth pattern as finger millet, Lambert et al. [43] found a strong relationship between Sentinel-2 based LAI data and crop biomass (R² = 0.84), which is much higher than in our study (R² = 0.46). Although neither sensors and platforms, nor the range of crop phenology and management were comparable, this study highlights the scope of well-informed satellite-based hyperspectral imagery, and proximal imagery may make important contributions to such developments, e.g., by the provision of crop-specific spectral libraries as a source of reference spectra that can aid the interpretation of hyperspectral and multispectral image [44].Although we observed quite some deviation between predicted and observed FMB, the median was close to zero at all levels of N and water supply, when the Generalised models were used for all the three crops. This proves the robustness of models, which allow biomass prediction irrespective of varying nitrogen and water management practices. However, the pronounced pattern of deviations along the sampling dates in Y1 and Y2 points at the limitations of models, which are solely built on spectral information. Although soil-containing pixels were masked out of the images prior to model calibration, a substantial overestimation of biomass at the initial sampling dates in the growing season occurred, while biomass was frequently underestimated at later sampling dates. The overestimation of biomass may be caused by weeds at the initial sampling dates as the effect of weeds could not be controlled in the estimation of biomass. Further, the prediction error for crops increased in the order lablab (13.9%), finger millet (18%) and maize (18.7%), which clearly shows that spectral information captured at the top canopy layer is increasingly less representative of the biomass at lower layers of the canopy. This effect is also addressed as the “saturation constraint” and was regularly found in previous studies (e.g., [45,46,47]) particularly when vegetation indices, such as the Normalised Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI), were used. Obviously, this problem cannot be circumvented by the use of individual spectral wavelengths instead of vegetation indices, but stresses the vital necessity to develop multi-sensor approaches, in which each sensor’s shortcomings are compensated by other sensors [10,48,49].As a common trait for all three crops, wavelengths in the red-edge area were of utmost importance for the estimation of crop biomass. The Generalised model for lablab further comprised several wavelengths in the green, red and NIR region, indicating a larger number of variables in these models. Similar important bands were found by Manjunath et al. [50] in the discrimination of chickpea, pea and lentils. While in maize the most important variables were found in the red-edge region, the model of finger millet also contained wavelengths in the red region as important variables. For lablab, several bands were identified in the visible part of spectrum (450–750 nm) to be important for biomass prediction. These bands are known to be affected by plant pigments, especially by chlorophyll [51]. The ability of lablab to fix atmospheric nitrogen may have resulted in longer greenness of the leaves over the growing period, which leads to a higher reflectance at the green peak (~550 nm) and a higher absorbance in red (~650 nm). In general, the identified spectral bands confirm accepted knowledge about biomass-reflectance relationships [52]. ", 4. Discussion,None,4
271,"Although Generalised models performed better at various management practices, the application of terrestrial hyperspectral measurements is still time consuming and cannot be applied on larger scales. Contrarily, drone techniques carry great potential to collect hyperspectral imagery in a comparable spatial resolution for larger areas. Another limitation is the dependence of the relative prediction error of the models from the growth development of the crops, which may have been enhanced by the change of crop varieties across years.", 5. Potential and Limitations,None,5
272,"It has been shown that random forest regression modelling based on multi-temporal hyperspectral imagery allows the prediction of fresh matter biomass of three major food and feed crops, i.e., lablab, maize and finger millet, grown in the monsoon season on vast areas of southern India. The results of this study showed that Generalised models, which were built on crop data from both rainfed and irrigated conditions, are more robust than water management specific models. For all Generalised crop models, deviations between predicted and observed values were independent of N fertiliser and water supply, indicating a wide validity range of the models. However, an overestimation of crop biomass was detected at initial growth stages of crops along with an underestimation at the later stages of the crop growth, which was particularly pronounced with the more productive crops maize and finger millet. While wavelengths in the red edge region were important variables in all three Generalised crop models, several others in the visible and near infrared region were important in models for lablab and finger millet. The results of this study suggest that, for the tested monsoon crops at advanced maturity, even hyperspectral information is not sufficient for an accurate biomass prediction. Data fusion from a combination of sensors may improve the prediction performance, as complementary sensors can compensate for their respective deficiencies. Although lablab and finger millet are important food and cattle crops in South India, there is surprisingly little research done up to date, thus further research in this field will be of major importance considering the dynamic changes in societal and climatic conditions in this region.", 6.

273,"Based on the general FAO definition of forests, there were an estimated 88 million ha of forest area in Mediterranean countries in 2015, occupying the 10.04% of the total area of these countries and representing 2.20% of the world’s total forest area [1]. In 2015, these forests stored 5066 billion tons of carbon, equivalent to 1.7% of global forest carbon [1]. Additionally, in some cases, this forest definition could exclude important vegetative formations, such as most open oak woodlands of Quercus species (e.g., Spanish Dehesas and Portuguese Montados) [2], that would be contributing significantly to carbon storage. Effective large-scale monitoring of Mediterranean forest ecosystem therefore has a critical role for adapting to climate change [3,4]. The recommendation of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is to use a combination of Earth observation (EO) data and field-based inventories to estimate the forest area, carbon stocks, and changes [5]. Nationwide surveys in the form of a National Forest Inventory (NFI) have contributed by means of extensive fieldwork campaigns to monitor the dynamics of the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector [6]. The monitoring of aboveground carbon represents an operational challenge under NFI sampling designs, and it may not provide reliable local estimates, for instance, at sub-regional and national level [7]. The support from remote sensing data (RS) has contributed to a better understanding of the spatial drivers of variation in LULUCF global flagship indicators such as forest aboveground biomass (AGB) [5]. In fact, Eggleston et al. (2006) [8] have listed AGB as one of the most important carbon pools by representing around 30% of the total terrestrial ecosystem carbon pool [9]. Therefore, accurately mapping and monitoring the spatio-temporal distribution of AGB at local, regional, and global scales is a crucial step towards an effective carbon stocks quantification and consequently a better climate change mitigation plan. Spatially continuous information on forest 3D structure is essential to estimate AGB distribution [10]. During the past three decades, airborne laser scanning (ALS) has become an established solid method for accurately mapping key indicators for Mediterranean forests (e.g., canopy height [11], forest inventory variables [12], aboveground carbon [13], and canopy fuel characteristics [14]) at high spatial resolution and in a relatively short time compared to conventional methods. The high costs of surveying at local/regional scale using ALS technology can result in low temporal resolution of AGB estimates, narrowing the potential of ALS technology at vectorizing the estimation of AGB maps in many countries. The situation has changed recently once global spaceborne laser scanning missions have turned operational and accessible [15,16].The Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat-2) [17] and the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) [18] missions are continuously scanning over the Earth’s land surfaces since 2018 and 2019, respectively. The Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) on-board the ICESat-2 satellite and GEDI mission on-board the International Space Station (ISS) are currently generating dense along-track LiDAR information at large spatial coverages and can be used to support carbon monitoring and fuel mapping estimations at global level. GEDI and ICESat2 mission depends on world-wide, crowd-sourced in situ field inventories, and ALS datasets to develop representative pre-launch calibration equations for predicting AGB across the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) observation domain [19,20,21]. GEDI mission transports a full-waveform (FW) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument to monitor tropical and temperate forests ecosystems. A robust post-launch validation is therefore needed to assess the accuracy of the spaceborne LiDAR sensor, especially due to the difficulties in differentiating AGB and characterizing the vegetation structure under sparse forest cover, which is characteristic of, e.g., Quercus spp. Mediterranean forests [22]. Spanish countrywide low-density ALS data has been successfully used for estimating forestry attributes in Mediterranean forests using the area based approach (ABA) (e.g., [9,18]). In the case of Extremadura region (Spain), well-georeferenced Fourth Spanish National Forest Inventory (SNFI-4) plots and low-density ALS data have greatly contributed to improve large-scale estimates of biophysical forest attributes [3,4,13,23]. The efficiency of the ABA method deeply relies on the temporal and spatial alignment between field measurements and laser statistics. Since, top-height vegetation maps derived from GEDI technology are being developed nowadays worldwide, across a gradient of complex environments [10,24,25,26,27,28], many researchers could consider using GEDI data as the only source on which to rely for forest structure estimation, in the absence of multi-temporal ALS in the near future. Hence, developing GEDI-based AGB models from Mediterranean areas using existing ALS-based AGB estimates towards the domain of new spaceborne datasets (specifically to those designed to map ecosystem structure observation, i.e., GEDI, ICESat2, NASA’s NISAR, ESA’s BIOMASS) is a relevant exercise, since satellite-derived data offers unique opportunities to produce large-scale forest estimates on 3D forest structure.Several studies have assessed the accuracy of GEDI and ICESat-2-derived canopy heights [10,24,25,28] and AGB estimates [15,20,21,29] from different ecosystems around the world. However, canopy height was validated using non coincident temporal or simulated ALS data [10,24,25,28] and simulated GEDI and ICESat-2-data to calibrate global AGB models [15,20,21,29]. Hence, it is important, first, to evaluate the accuracies of post-launch GEDI data and products, since they might differ from the accuracies of the simulated GEDI data, and secondly, to calibrate/validate the local and regional spaceborne LiDAR-AGB model. The dynamics of forest ecosystems are especially challenging in sparse ecosystems for which the interpretation of laser echoes remains more uncertain than in full-cover conditions, where the upper canopy layer more uniformly captures the energy from laser beams. The case of Mediterranean forests could provide valuable insights on how forest horizontal complexity determines the performance of GEDI-based estimates when compared to ALS-based estimation. The study analyzes a gradient of forest ecosystems from sparse to dense forest cover conditions on which to show the performance of ABA models when applied using recent ALS surveys (2018–2019) and recent GEDI scanning shots (2019). The spatial and temporal co-registration between ALS and GEDI shots were specifically considered in this investigation. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted in Mediterranean areas focused on developing AGB models using ongoing satellite LiDAR missions. This is a crucial step to better understand forest AGB distribution and spatial changes in terrestrial carbon fluxes. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to assess the main capabilities of the GEDI sensor for estimating canopy height and AGB over five different Mediterranean forest ecosystems in south-west Spain. To fulfill this goal, two specific objectives were defined: (1) assess the accuracy of GEDI-derived canopy height, and (2) quantify the performance of the GEDI-derived models based on canopy metrics (height and cover) in predicting AGB. To do that, the ALS-derived canopy height and AGB computed for the study area were used as reference data.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
274,"The study area was located in the province of Badajoz (region of Extremadura, south-west of Spain). Badajoz is the biggest province in Spain covering 21,766 km2 (Figure 1). The Spanish Forest Map (SFM) and the sampling design of the SNFI-4 were used in this research to cover a wide range of Mediterranean types of forests. The last version of the SFM at 25-m resolution was used to select the forest areas corresponding to the most representative species in Extremadura. We selected five forest ecosystems: (i) Dehesas: agro-forestry–pastoral ecosystem that contains scattered tree cover (60–100 trees per ha) dominated by even-aged old-growth evergreen oaks (Quercus spp.) usually with an absence of natural regeneration due to the presence of pastures and agricultural fields as undercover; (ii) Encinar: uneven-aged sparse oak forest (Quercus ilex subsp. ballota (Desf.) Samp); (iii) Alcornocales: even-aged multilayered forest dominated by the cork oak (Quercus suber L.); (iv) Pinaster: even-aged forests of Pinus pinaster subsp. mesogeensis Aiton; and (v) Pinea: even-aged forests of Pinus pinea. According to the SFM, the analyzed forest stands cover a total 822,623 ha distributed as follows: 664,529.97 ha (Dehesas), 98,950.11 ha (Encinares), 14,482.87 ha (Pinaster), 17,052.81 ha (Alcornocales), and 27,610.21 ha (Pinea).", 2.

275,"ALS campaigns can be considered temporally coincident with the GEDI track, since there was a maximum of 1 year time interval between ALS acquisition date and the set of the analyzed GEDI full waveform (FW) beam footprint. Two sets of ALS point clouds were processed in this study: (i) Extremadura North (EXT-N, collected during the period of October 2018 to March 2019) and (ii) Extremadura South (EXT-S, collected during the period of October 2018 to July 2019). Both data sets correspond to the second round of countrywide ALS measurements, which are publicly available in Spain through the PNOA project (Plan Nacional de Ortofotografía Aérea). Squared ALS blocks of 2-km side, covering the whole region of Extremadura were obtained from the CNIG (“Centro Nacional de Infomación Geográfica” http://centrodedescargas.cnig.es/CentroDescargas/index.jsp, accessed on 1 June 2020) to cover the province of Badajoz. The scanning sensors involved in collecting the ALS data in the study area were a RIEGL LMS-Q1560 for the EXT-N dataset and a LEICA ALS80 for the EXT-S dataset. The nominal laser pulse density varied between 2 points m−2 in the EXT-N and 1 point m−2 in the EXT-S. The vertical accuracy of the scanning survey was 0.15 m for both ALS datasets.The processing workflow comprised the following steps: Firstly, thindata command implemented in FUSION software [30] was used to reduce the nominal pulse density to 1 point m−2 in order to homogenize the results from both datasets (EXT-N, EXT-S). Secondly, the ALS data sets were processed using the LAStools software [31]. A detailed description of the software parametrization and processing workflow is provided in Pascual et al., 2020 [4]. Briefly, lasheight were used to normalize the classified point cloud of ALS echoes. The lascanopy command was used to extract the metrics from the ALS normalized point cloud using a buffer of 12.5 m of radius for the center of each GEDI footprint (Table 1). Finally, the above-ground height of ALS echoes was used to distinguish tree canopies (echoes above 2 m) and the shrub layer (echoes below 2 m) when computing the ALS height statistics (lascanopy parameters: height_cutoff = 2, cover_cutoff = 2) [32] (Table 1).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Airborne Laser Scanning Acquisition and Processing,2
276,"GEDI-derived Level 2A (L2A) and Level 2B (L2B) data were used in this study (Table 2). GEDI L2A data contain the latitude, longitude, elevation, canopy height, and surface energy metrics (rh0, rh10, …, rh90, rh95, rh98, rh99, rh100) extracted from return waveforms of the various reflecting surfaces located within each laser footprint [33]. The GEDI L2B standard data product adds vertical profile metrics: the canopy cover (CCGEDI), plant area index (PAI), estimated vertical canopy directional gap probability for the selected L2A algorithm (PGP_THT), and foliage height diversity index (FHD) for each laser footprint located on the land surface [34]. The bounding box of the Badajoz province was used to select all the GEDI beams within study area. There were 99 GEDI orbit tracks in HDF5 format available to the 15 July 2020 date (Figure 1). The GEDI laser shots considered in this research were collected in 2019 between 21 April and 31 October. The attribute Quality Flag (QF) was used to disregard all GEDI shots classified as 0, meaning that the technical and quality attributes for a given shot number (identifier) were not according to standards. A QF value of 1 indicates that a given shot number meets quality criteria based on energy, sensitivity, amplitude, and real-time surface tracking, and therefore, these shots were used for further analysis. See details of interpretation of L2A and L2B QF in [33,34]. The rGEDI package [35] was used to retrieve and process the GEDI data under the 3.6 version of the R statistical software [36] (R Core Team 2020).The benchmark between ALS and GEDI was carried out within the boundaries of SFM polygons intersecting GEDI ground tracks. First, we selected GEDI shots completely contained within the forest type-specific SFM polygons (Dehesas, Encinares, Alcornocales, Pinaster, and Pinea). Second, GEDI shots located further than 30 m from the edge of SFM boundaries were selected [27]. The final filter disregarded GEDI shots above the percentile 99th values observed SNFI-4 plots in Badajoz. The total set comprised 63,135 shots: 38,983 for Dehesas, 15,958 for Encinares, 3026 for Alcornocales, 1534 for Pinaster, and 3634 for Pinea. Finally, the matching between the GEDI- and ALS-derived canopy height metrics was evaluated in terms of Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) (Equation (1)), the overall root mean square error (RMSE, Equation (2)), the relative root mean square error (rRMSE, Equation (3)), Bias (Equation (4)), and rBias % (Equation (5)).

A total of 508 georeferenced plots with high-end positioning equipment were used to calibrate forest type-specific ALS-derived AGB models (Table 3). The field measurements of the SNFI-4 campaign in Extremadura were carried out during the year 2017. The uncertainty in the co-registration between ALS and field measurements was mitigated using high-performance global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) to improve positioning information. A handheld data collection system (TRIMBLE Juno 5B handheld, Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was used to determine the coordinates (error range 1–2 m of positioning error after post-processing) during field measurements.

The models were fitted using the nls function implemented in the BASE package of the R software [36].Forest type-specific ALS-based AGB models for Dehesas, Encinares, Alcornocales, Pinaster, and Pinea were calibrated. The first step in the modeling phase was to select the optimal set of predictor variables to be used in the estimation of AGB. The leaps package, which is available for R [38], was used to select the significant predictors of the regression. In this study, we proposed the use of two predictors to estimate the parameter from the models. Collinearity between regressors was prevented by checking the variance inflation factor (VIF). In this study, regressors with VIF above 10 were disregarded [39]. In addition, a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was performed for each potential regression model using programming routines in R [36].Finally, we computed the model efficiency (Mef, Equation (7)), the overall root mean square error (RMSE, Equation (8)), the relative root mean square error (rRMSE, Equation (9)), the Bias (Equation (10)), and rBias (Equation (11)) to determine the accuracy of ALS-derived models for estimating AGB using four different modeling approach.

279,"Firstly, the set of ALS-derived biomass models were applied to estimate AGB for the different forest ecosystems (Dehesas, Encinares, Alcornocales, Pinaster, and Pinea forests) at laser footprint level (~25 m), i.e., by using the ALS-derived metrics extracted from the extent of the GEDI shots. Secondly, the forest type-specific ALS-derived AGB estimates at footprint level was used as independent variable to develop GEDI-derived AGB models for each forest type, by using the upper rh metrics (rh60, rh70, rh80, rh90, rh95, rh98, rh99) from L2A and canopy profile metrics CCGEDI, PAI, PGP_THT, and LHD from L2B as explanatories variables (Table 2). For GEDI-derived AGB models, the method was similar to ALS-derived AGB models. The empirical relationship between ALS characteristics and stand-level forest biomass suggests that common models based on metrics of height distributions or a combination between metrics of height distributions and measurements related to the vertical canopy structure may be widely applicable to diverse forest types [40,41,42]. In addition, the combination of upper metric rh90, rh95, rh98, rh99, CCGEDI, PAI, PGP_THT, and LHD was also tested. Then, we computed the performance of these forest type-specific models at GEDI footprint level in terms of Mef, RMSE, rRMSE, bias, and rBias as described in Section 2.5. Models were compared using Mef, RMSE, rbias, and a graphical inspection of the model residuals at the end of each model procedure. A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was performed for each potential regression model using the R software [36].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.6. GEDI-Derived AGB Models,2
280,"The relationship between p98 and rh98 was the best in terms of r correlation for the five forest ecosystems, except for Dehesas where p99–rh99 was slightly better in r (Table 4, Figure 2 and Figure 3). The p98–rh98 comparison for 5 forest ecosystems yielded r Pearson values ranging from 0.49 to 0.65 for Dehesas, Encinares, and Alcornocales, and 0.71 for Pinaster and Pinea forests. In terms of rRMSE values, the error was slightly lower for the comparison between p98 and rh98 than for p95–rh95 and p99–rh99, except for Dehesas and Pinaster. The RMSE values of p98–rh98 for Dehesas, Encinares, Alcornocales, Pinaster, and Pinea were 2.05, 2.17, 1.95, 3.96, and 2.37 m, respectively; the rRMSE values were 29.39%, 38.68%, 31.14%, 28.63%, and 28.29%, respectively; while the bias values were −0.50, 0.39, −0.06, −0.97, and 0.27 m, respectively. In terms of bias and bias%, the p99–rh99 relationships were slightly better than p98–rh98 for Dehesas and Pinaster. Finally, Figure 2 and Figure 3 depict the mean difference between rh98 and p98 metrics when the values are classified based on CCALS for all the forest ecosystems. For the Dehesas, Alcornocales, and Pinaster formations, we found negative differences, on average, between rh98 and p98 when canopy cover is <50% (Figure 2b,f and Figure 3b), indicating that GEDI underestimates the canopy height (rh98) when compared with ALS p98. On the opposite, a mean positive difference between rh98 and p98 was observed for both Encinares and Pinea forest types, indicating that the GEDI canopy heights were higher than the ALS data across all the canopy cover classes, except when canopy cover is >90% for which the mean differences turn negative (Figure 2d and Figure 3d). This could indicate GEDI limitations in penetrating dense canopy cover conditions, such as the case of Encinares and Pinea forest types.", 3. Results, 3.1. GEDI-ALS Metrics Accuracy,3
281,"The performance of models for each forest type in terms of Mef, RMSE, and rRMSE are shown in Table 5. Non-linear regression models for AGB in Dehesas, Encinares, and Alcornocales forest ecosystems yielded Mef values ranging from 0.27 to 0.84 and from 0.76 to 0.86 for Pinaster and Pinea, respectively. In terms of rRMSE values, the values were slightly higher in Dehesas and Encinares (49.75 and 51.48%) than in Alcornocales (31.01%), Pinaster (37.01%) and Pinea (27.22%). In general, ALS-based models were better in terms of Mef, RMSE, and rRMSE in more closed Pinus and Alcornocales forests than in Encinares and Dehesas characterized by more open canopies.

Scatterplots of ALS-observed vs. GEDI-estimated AGB at GEDI footprint level are shown in Figure 4 for the best forest type-specific model in terms of Mef. Table A2 (Appendix A) shows AGB estimation accuracies from LOOCV procedures by applying the best model summarized by the Mediterranean formations. The negative and positive mean values in bias (Mg/ha) and rBias (%) indicate that the GEDI-derived AGB estimates are systematically underestimating (Dehesa, Pinaster, and Pinea) or overestimating (Encinares and Alcorncoles) ALS-based AGB estimates. Non-linear regression models for five formations yielded Mef values ranging from 0.31 to 0.46. In terms of rRMSE values, the values were slightly lower with the Dehesas (38.17%) and Encinares (57.87%) than Alcornocales (84.74%), Pinaster (48.19%), and Pinea (63.97%), respectively. In general, based on the histograms results for the best model (Figure 4b–j), the models slightly underestimated AGB over lower and higher intervals, corresponding with low and high canopy cover conditions. The models fitted with the best combination of one upper metric and one measurement related to vertical canopy structure were less unbiased than the models using stepwise selection methods throughout the observed AGB–ALS range. Models fitted with the combination of rh95, rh98, rh99, CCGEDI and FHD variables proved to be the most accurate and less unbiased models for Dehesas, Alcornocales, Pinaster, and Pinea, respectively. Although PAI and PGP_THT were also significant variables in the models, the proportion of variation explained by the regressions was lower than the models fitted by upper metrics in combination with CCGEDI and FHD in AGB modeling, except for Encinares, where PGP_THT was included in the best model. The model for pure homogenous Pinea forest yielded the best performance throughout the observed AGB (Figure 4i,j).", 3. Results, 3.3. Performance of GEDI AGB-Derived Models,3
283,"The usability of previously developed AGB models from ALS surveys and expensive fieldwork campaigns is especially relevant under region-wide sampling designs. The NASA GEDI mission brings an opportunity to update estimates of biomass across vast forest landscapes. The laser technology applied in FW GEDI differs from the discrete-return scanning carried out under mainstream ALS applications. Therefore, it is important to evaluate and understand the potential of GEDI data for its integrations in ALS-based workflows in forest inventory and forest management. Our study evaluated the ALS and GEDI performances using robust AGB models under the same temporal co-registration between ALS and GEDI datasets, and over five forest types with different complexities in terms of vertical and horizontal structure of the canopies. The bias in the prediction biomass estimates using GEDI observations as independent data depends on the model structure and the predictor variables included. Despite the fact that some recent studies in the literature assessed the accuracy of real [10,25] or ALS-simulated GEDI data [20,21,43,44], our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one to evaluate the performance of on-orbit GEDI L2A and L2B (Version 1) products in obtaining AGB estimates at footprint level (GEDI-like Level4A) by comparing with spatially and temporally coincident, discrete-return ALS data across vast areas of diverse Mediterranean types of forests.Regarding the accuracy of GEDI canopy height estimates, our results are in accordance with the previously published studies that analyzed simulated GEDI data from pre-launch GEDI mission (e.g., Silva et al., 2018 [43] (p. 3517, p98 = rh98, RMSE = 2.99 m, bias = 0.47 m, bias(%) = 1.50, n = 2987) and Hancock et al., 2019 [45] (p. 306, p98 = rh98, RMSE = 4.78 m, bias = 0.22 m). However, it is important to evaluate the accuracies of post launch GEDI data and products, since they might differ from the accuracies of the ALS-simulated GEDI data [15,36,38] due to possible geolocation inaccuracies or spatiotemporal variations in atmospheric attenuation [26]. The use of the 95th percentile resulted in more negative and positive bias and less accurate estimates than the 98th (RMSE increased from 2.03 m in Alcornocales to 4.17 m in Pinaster). In terms of bias and bias%, the p99–rh99 relationship was slightly better than p98–rh98 for Dehesas and Pinaster. The results confirm that the accuracy of GEDI–FW estimates of canopy height depends on the complexity of the horizontal and vertical structure of the Mediterranean vegetation. The GEDI footprint estimates were better in more closed and homogeneous coniferous forests of P. pinaster and P.pinea species (r = 0.71) than in open canopy Quercus-dominated forests with values of r ranging from 0.50 (sparse Dehesas) to 0.61 (multi-layered Alcornocales). The performance between metrics were similar in terms of RMSE and bias to recent published research at the European level [28] (RMSE = 2.5 m, rRMSE = 45%, and positive bias = 0.70), although our rRMSE values were slightly better from our study ranging from 28.29% to 38.68%. ALS–GEDI metrics accuracy for Quercus-dominated forest were similar in terms of r to the results obtained by Adam et al., 2020 [25] who compared GEDI waveform (rh100) to the maximum of ALS-derived (hmax) canopy height model in two different temperate forests in central Germany (r = 0.52–0.58, R2 = 0.27–0.34, bias = −0.23–2.11 m). The relationship between p98 and rh98 in Pinus-dominated forests (r = 0.71) was slightly lower than the one reported by Potapov et al., 2020 [10] when comparing p90 and rh95 (r = 0.84, R2 = 0.71, bias = −0.7 m, RMSE = 6.5 m, n = 23,491). This was probably due to the low density of the ALS data used in our study (approx. 1 pulses m−2) compared with that used by Potapov et al., 2020. However, our values in terms of bias (−0.97 for Pinaster and 0.28 for Pinea) and RMSE (RMSE = 3.8 m for Pinaster and RMSE = 2.37 m for Pinea) were better than the values obtained by Potapov et al., 2020. In any case, ALS reference data from Adam et al., 2020 and Potapov et al., 2020 might have also influenced their results, since there was a large time difference between ALS-acquisition dates (2012 and 2017) and GEDI-acquisition dates (2019). Mediterranean vegetation has, in general, low complexity if we compare it with complex vegetation structures such as tropical forests. This fact may be the main reason for the relatively low errors compared with other recent published studies [10,28]. Potapov et al., 2020 [10] compared GEDI relative height metrics data (rh90, rh95, and rh100) to the 90th percentile of ALS-derived height distribution (p90). The authors found that rh90 underestimated canopy height compared to p90 (mean difference −2.3 m) and rh100 overestimated it compared to p90 (mean difference +2.7 m). Our results showed that rh95 tends to underestimate canopy height compared to ALS-derived canopy height estimations for Dehesas (bias = −1.37), Pinaster (bias = −1.69), Pinea (bias = −0.53), and Alcornocales (bias = −0.80) and rh99 tends to overestimate canopy height compared to ALS-derived canopy height estimations in forest ecosystems as Alcornocales (bias = 0.80), Encinares (bias = 0.40), and Pinea (bias = 0.70). The results confirmed that GEDI height metric rh95 tends to underestimate canopy height when compared with ALS data in Mediterranean areas of sparse tree cover as reported by Potapov et al., 2020 [10]. Regarding the effects of canopy cover on the accuracy levels of GEDI height estimates, our results revealed that canopy heights were most accurate in the 50–90% range of canopy cover, and tend to present higher errors in dense cover (>90%) conditions as documented by [45] (see Figure 7d with rh90 in [45]). Neuenschwander et al., 2020 [29], in a study focused on assessing the accuracy of ICESat-2 data for canopy height estimates, also found this pattern. This confirms that, at low canopy cover (<50%) conditions, both ICESat-2 and GEDI full-waveform (FW) energies are more likely to be reflected from the terrain surface rather than the canopy, which precludes an accurate estimation of canopy height [33,34]. On the contrary, for the dense canopy cover conditions (CC > 90%) the terrain-reflected signal received by the GEDI and ICESat-2 sensors is more weak than the canopy signal leading to errors in canopy heights measurements [28,29,33].Therefore, rh metrics may be biased particularly in extreme (low and high) canopy cover conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess the performance and usefulness of the first release of the GEDI data (Version 1), which has a systematic geolocation error around 10–20 m [33,34]. As such, the accuracy of this data version was assessed without performing any geolocation error correction. Hence, the lower performance of the GEDI-derived canopy height in low density tree cover conditions, such as in Dehesas, can also reflect the impacts of the GEDI (Version 1) geolocation errors. In this type of ecosystem, the spatial fuzziness caused by the tree density variability can preclude the true comparison between GEDI measurements and the observed measurements on the ground. In a scattered tree ecosystem, such as Dehesas, an horizontal offset between 10 and 20 m can result in several meters of height errors, affecting model calibration and validation at the GEDI footprint level [10].The GEDI mission was specifically designed to retrieve vegetation structure and AGB under a large range of environmental conditions sufficient to meet AGB mapping requirements. Regarding the exercise of developing GEDI AGB models using ALS AGB equations as similar to what GEDI’s footprint level AGB product 4A will produce, the results suggested that existing ALS–AGB estimates could be used to generate robust GEDI-derived AGB models to predict AGB at footprint level in Mediterranean areas. For any spaceborne biomass estimate, validation using reference data is challenging, given that almost all reference data will have errors [19]. The results of the present study showed that GEDI-derived AGB models based on upper rh metric, CCGEDI, FHD, and PGP_THT represent a sufficient quantitative description of Mediterranean structure analyzed at 25-m diameter footprint GEDI level using ALS-derived AGB estimates as reference. In terms of RMSE and rRMSE for the five forest ecosystem (RMSE = 15.25, 14.13, 22.06, 1.87, 27.95 Mg/ha, and rRMSE 37.85%, 57.87%, 84.74%, 47.75%, 63.02% for Dehesas, Encinares, Alcornocales, Pinaster, and Pinea, respectively), the precision of the GEDI-derived AGB models were similar or better (except in Alcornocales and Pinea) than those values reported by Duncanson et al., 2020 [20] (using GEDI simulations and a locally trained biomass model, calibrated against the ALS 30-m reference map in Sonoma County (US) (p. 111779-Table 2, rRMSE = 57.1%)). In Dehesas, Encinares, and Pinaster modeling, the rRMSE values achieved were also similar or better than to those reported by Silva et al., 2021 [21], who obtained an rRMSE of 54% for Sonoma County (US), with GEDI and ICESat-2 fused AGB calibration at a regular grid-based using GEDI’s AGB models from Duncanson et al. 2020. However, the more complex and multilayered forest as Alcornocales (rRMSE = 84.74%) was the least accurately modeled of the Mediterranean forest. Our GEDI-derived AGB models using a combination of canopy height and vertical canopy structure metric from L2A and L2B product, respectively, were less unbiased in terms of bias and rbias (bias = −0.08, 0.14, 0.71, −0.45, −0.56 Mg/ha, rbias = −0.20%, 0.65%, 2.73%, −0.67%, and 1.27%, for Dehesas, Encinares, Alcornocales, Pinaster, and Pinea, respectively) than those values reported by Duncanson et al., 2020 [20] (bias = −26.3 Mg/ha and bias% = −18.7%) using US-wide GEDI AGB models based on only rh metrics and simulated AGB estimates at footprint level (GEDI-like Level4A as our study). In terms of rbias, the values were also slightly better than the values reported by Silva et al., 2021 [21] (bias% = −5.60%) using GEDI, ICESat-2, and NISAR fusion. In general, the GEDI-based AGB models were slightly negatively biased at lower and higher intervals, meaning that GEDI derived AGB models underestimated AGB under low and dense canopy cover conditions, as previous studies using simulated GEDI data [20]. There was no appreciable bias from the models throughout the observed AGB in pure homogenous Pinea forests (Figure 4i,j), in comparison with more complex vegetation as Alcornocoles and Encinares. Our models yielded slightly lower values of Mef (0.31 to 0.46) (similar as adj. R2) to those obtained by Silva et al., 2021 [21] (adj. R2 ranging from 0.46 to 0.51). GEDI-derived models from our study captured AGB variations slightly worse, probably due to the following: (i) a wide variety of vegetation was analyzed in AGB modeling from the same dataset by Duncanson et al., 2020, (ii) ALS reference map was used to calibrate instead of applying the trained model to ALS point cloud metrics derived at GEDI footprint level as in our study, (iii) Duncanson et al., 2020 and Silva et al., 2021 used ALS-simulated GEDI data and the ALS point cloud density was higher than in our study, and (iv) the influence of the GEDI (Version 1) geolocation errors into the models. If we compare with the ICESat2 mission, the values obtained in the present study were also worse, in terms rRMSE, than those reported by Narine et al., 2020 [46] using a simulated ICESat-2 vegetation product and ALS estimates AGB as reference (RMSE values were 28.90 Mg/ha or rRMSE = 37% of a mean value of 79 Mg/ha with the training dataset) in south Texas (US) (approximately 58% of the region or 80% of its forested area, predominantly coniferous forests). Our results demonstrated that metrics derived from L2A and L2B products at GEDI footprint level, such as canopy height (rh99, rh95, rh90) and vertical canopy structure metric (CCGEDI, FHD), were found to be significant explanatory variables for predicting AGB. We suggest that foliage height diversity index (FHD) [37], which measures the complexity of canopy structure, should be included as explanatory variables in Alcornocales formation. The use of canopy height metrics alone may omit some information in profiles with more vertical and horizontal heterogeneity, such as in natural Mediterranean forest. Conversely, vertical canopy structure metrics contributed to most models for estimating the AGB. The variable PGP_THT, based on the model from [47], in combination with rh90 upper metric, resulted in less biased models than GEDI-derived models using the variable canopy cover (CCGEDI) and plan area index (PAI) in Encinares. Our results also demonstrate that a specific second metric related to canopy cover (CCGEDI) from LiDAR waveforms is potentially useful for improving most of the models (Table 6). According to the results obtained, the set of models strengthened the idea that the combination of mean height and vertical canopy structure metrics represents a sufficient and concise quantitative description of a homogeneous vertical structure in Mediterranean Areas as Pinea forest. However, the results also showed the limitations of the GEDI spaceborne LiDAR mission in differentiating AGB and characterizing vegetation structure, specially under sparse canopy cover [22,29].The trade-off between model accuracy when building AGB models and their use to predict AGB estimates using alternative data sources is an interesting hot research topic embraced under data fusion methods in forest monitoring and assessment. The result from this study would allow forest managers and scientists to better understand ABG dynamics in forest ecosystems, while adding value and use to existing ALS–AGB models developed in the past over valuable fieldwork data. The study from Adam et al., 2020 showed also the influence of low canopy conditions when validating GEDI estimates using multi-temporal ALS as benchmark. The assessment that we performed controlled the temporal co-registration and the spatial co-registration uncertainty, as our filters were less tolerant with the effect of edges and fragmentation. In the study by Adam et al., 2020, the use of ALS data collected in 2014, 2018, and 2019 somehow restricted the accuracy of the benchmark, as only part of the ALS surveys overlapped in time with the start of the GEDI mission. The integration of laser satellite products from the GEDI mission might be regarded as a first take before the launch of the BIOMASS satellite mission. Therefore, understanding the technology of satellite missions to address co-registration problems seems vital in order to combine the rich array of sources that forest managers have nowadays as national forest inventories, ALS campaigns, small-scale photogrammetry, and ongoing satellite image missions [17,29,48,49]. Upcoming version of GEDI products addressing geolocation could improve the results obtained in the Extremadura Region. In addition, further work is recommended to introduce the uncertainty of the ALS–AGB models and the forest species map were ignored in the modeling approach.", 4. Discussion,None,4
284,"This study used real GEDI data for assessing canopy forest height and determining AGB in different Mediterranean forest ecosystems. Firstly, the results showed the accuracy in canopy height from the L2A products using upper metrics from ALS. Secondly, GEDI calibration equations from Mediterranean forest were developed as a similar exercise to generate L4A products at footprint level (~25-m diameter). Our study highlighted the difficulty in differentiating AGB and characterizing vegetation structure under sparse forest cover, which is characteristic of Mediterranean forests. The findings provide an initial evaluation of the ability of GEDI to estimate AGB and serve as a basis for further upscaling efforts. For future challenges, reference canopy height, wall-to-wall ALS–AGB maps, and NFI plots from the Region of Extremadura will be used to validate the upcoming L4A and gridded Level 4B products where these footprints are used to produce mean AGB and its uncertainty in cells of 1 km. Further research could evaluate the robustness of the GEDI version 2 to compute part of the uncertainty in height/AGB caused by the mismatch in GEDI footprint geolocation and ALS point cloud data and how the new orbit corrections have improved the conditions to conduct ground-versus-ALS-versus-GEDI studies.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
285,"The spatial distribution of foliage in a forest canopy controls energy transfer to the lower plant components and also the ground [1], the interception of precipitation [2], photosynthesis [3], and other phenomena. As a result, leaf properties and canopy structure are important inputs in eco-physical models of forest environments [4]. Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an indicator for predicting photosynthetic primary production, evapotranspiration and crop growth [5]. LAI typically is defined as the vertically integrated one-sided area of leaves per unit ground surface area on a horizontal plane [6], and traditionally is measured through destructive sampling. Since LAI cannot be easily measured through non-destructive methods, effective LAI (LAIe) is more commonly measured in the field and calibrated to true LAI [6]. The difference between LAI and LAIe is that effective LAI does not differentiate between branches and foliar components. LAI effectively has been linked to vertical laser pulse return profiles using light detection and ranging (lidar). One elegant method is to calculate the ratio of the number of returns below the canopy to the total number of returns, and assume that this is related to gap fraction (P) of the canopy [7]:

 is the total number of returns and

 is the number of returns below some height above the ground surface (usually between 1 and 3 m). It has also been shown that this formula does not always provide a direct estimate of the gap fraction, but the ratio shown in Formula (2) can be used for LAI estimation when using airborne lidar data [7]:

where k is the extinction coefficient. An assumption of random or spherical leaf distribution is typically used, which results in the k value of 0.5 [8]. In reality, k values range from 0.25–0.75 [9].An alternative voxel-based approach for gap fraction estimation was presented in [10]. The authors sampled a plot with an area of 20 m by 40 m with fifteen Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) scans. These scans were then co-registered, providing a dense point cloud. The point cloud was partitioned into different voxels and the number of points were counted in each voxel. The authors estimated Plant Area Index (PAI) for two different point clouds, namely leaf-on and leaf-off. PAI was calculated using the following equation:

where 

N
i

 is the number of laser beams passing through voxel number i, and 

I
i

 is the number of returns within the voxel i. The plot level PAI was then obtained by taking the average of all the voxel PAI values. LAI was estimated as the difference between the PAI measurements for leaf-on and leaf-off point clouds. The resulting LAIs were in the range of 1.4–1.8, which is significantly lower than the LAI values obtained via traditional manual methods (LAI = 2.7–8.2).Another approach to assessing LAI using TLS is by estimating Leaf Area Density (LAD) [11]. LAD can be described as the total one-sided leaf area per unit volume [12] and the integration of a LAD profile vertically yields the LAI [13]. LAD can be estimated using direct, semi-direct, or indirect methods on-site [14]. The direct approach includes manual counting and measuring of leaves, while semi-direct methods count the contact of a leaf with probes inserted into the canopy [15]. Indirect techniques involve the application of passive optical devices, based on a gap fraction method [15]. However, the mentioned methods are limited in accuracy and in the spatial explicitness of their estimates [14]. As a result, the extracted 3D structures from lidar data can be used for measuring LAD [11]. One such manual method for finding the contact frequencies in the canopy is presented in [15], which is known as the inclined point quadrat method. In this method, a probe is pierced into the canopy at known heights and angles, and then the number of contact points with the foliage components are tallied. This method estimates the probability that a laser pulse penetrating the canopy will contact a foliage component. In Equation (4), N denotes the contact frequency, 

θ

.TLS, on the other hand, provides a fine spatial or angular resolution, thereby allowing the internal regions of the canopy to be evaluated from a ground perspective, making LAD estimation more accurate [17]. One of the important considerations of LAD estimation is the ability to describe the spatial distribution of leaves, separate from the woody canopy structures [14]. LAD estimation is highly affected by whether the leafy and woody parts are separated in the point cloud, and many studies have used manual techniques for leaf classification (e.g., [17]), although these approaches are time consuming. However, the intensity of the reflected pulse often can be used to distinguish a leaf from woody structures in the canopy [14], even though the intensity is affected by the range and incidence angle. Geometric methods have also been used for separating leaves and branches in TLS data [18], but obtaining geometric attributes of leaves and canopy-level structures is challenging, and is impacted by the angular scan resolution of the system, the pulse frequency, etc. [19]. We therefore opted for a density-based approach for segmenting the leaves in TLS point clouds, since such a method is more robust against variable system characteristics and can be applied more routinely; this approach will be described in detail in the Methods section.As mentioned earlier, LAI is calculated by the sum of the LAD measurements in vertical layers of the forest canopy:

In a more recent study, Shihua et al. [11] used a voxel-based method for estimating the LAD of an individual tree using point cloud segmentation of TLS data. They differentiated between the leafy and woody materials using the normal differences of the two. They also partitioned point cloud into sub-regions to improve the accuracy of the leaf extraction. It is important to note in this context that such point cloud segmentation approaches can be classified into three main categories, namely edge-detection, region-growth (blob-growth), and hybrid methods.Edge-detection techniques find the breaks in the surface of the point cloud, whereas the region-growth methods detect the continuous surfaces that are similar in geometric properties, and the hybrid methods combine the two mentioned approaches [20]. Normals of the point cloud can be used in segmentation of unorganized 3D point clouds. In short, the more the surface structure changes in adjacent areas, the more the normals of these areas are oriented differently. Figure 1 shows an illustration of the difference in normal distributions in leaves and branches.The normal differences of the leaf point cloud is generally smaller than those from non-leaf materials [11], and for a point, p, in the point cloud, it is measured by the following equation:

 and compared to a threshold. One common way for finding the threshold is using the Otsu algorithm [21].Furthermore, for this voxel-based method of LAD assessment, the point cloud is segmented into layers in the X direction, and LAD is calculated in all those layers using a voxel-based canopy profiling (VCP) method [17].

 are unit vectors showing the direction of the lidar beam and the direction of the leaf normal, respectively.The TLS used in this study provides lower-density data, due to lower angular resolution and pulse frequency, compared to commercial higher-cost systems. The minimum angular step-width of CBL is 4.36 mrad, which result in lidar point clouds with lower associated point density when compared to higher cost systems, for which the minimum angular step-width can be as small as 0.02 mrad [22]. These low-density data introduce challenges to automatic leaf segmentation algorithms. We therefore evaluated the ability of this arguably more operational system (low-cost; rapid-scan) to automatically extract leaf points, and propose an approach for estimating leaf density and LAI, using LAD assessment, at the plot level. This approach can be used for plot-level LAI assessment in complex forest environments, using such a low-cost, portable TLS, which can reduce the time and cost of data collection, and evaluate canopy-level structural attributes that cannot be measured in field due to the complex structure of these plots. This algorithm is especially helpful when there is no access to specific geometric attributes and parameters of the canopy-level structure, e.g., distance between the leaves, due to low-density data, or lack of relevant field measurements.", 1.

The 50 m × 100 m fetch area at the local flux tower site was divided into 22 rows and 11 columns with 5 m spacing forming 242 plots [24]. Figure 2 shows images from the HAVO site.", 2. Data, 2.1. HAVO Site,2
287,"In all of the 242 plots, LAI was measured using an AccuPAR LP-80 (METER Group, Pullman, WA, USA) instrument. Four measurements were recorded for each plot in the four cardinal directions, since the LAI is highly dependent on the spatial and illumination characteristics of the scanned location. Consequently, the average of the four measurements was considered as the LAI value for each plot. The AccuPAR LP-80 is a linear Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR) ceptometer. Its function is based on the amount of intercepted light in the canopy, which in turn can be used to estimate the LAI. The Accupar LP-80 has a probe consisting of 80 sensors, spaced 1 cm apart along that probe. The PAR is measured in the wavelength range of 400 to 700 nm, and has the units of micromols per meter squared per second (

). This instrument can be used as a hand-held or even unattended device. The device was held at approximately breast height (DBH level; 1.3 m above ground), i.e., slightly lower than the scanner, meaning that the LAI recorded by the Accupar is a result of vegetation cover above the DBH-level only, and should correspond with the lidar data collected via the CBL, at approximately the same height above ground. A second Accupar LP-80 was used to log available PAR at one minute intervals during the same period as the field collection effort; this instrument was mounted on a fire lookout tower approximately 500 m from the field site and was located above the forest canopy. The recorded values from two instruments were then synchronized based on recorded time. The following formulas are used for measuring LAI using this instrument (METER Group, 2018):

288,"The lidar data used in this study were collected using a low-cost, portable terrestrial laser system called the Compact Biomass Lidar (CBL) (LMS151, SICK AG, Waldkirch, Germany). This TLS system is a fast-scanning scanner with a 905 nm laser pulsing at 27 kHz, and a 0.25 degree angular resolution. Such low-cost sensors overcome the limitations of TLS in forest structural attribute evaluation, e.g., high cost, low mobility, and long scan time [25]. This system allows for efficient and fast sampling, but with a lower angular and point density resolution compared to higher-cost scanners. The lower resolution introduces challenges to the structural evaluation algorithms, and, as a result, applicable algorithms should be robust to low-density point cloud data. The sensor used in the CBL is a SICK LMS-151 scanner. The sensor is attached to a rotation stage, which rotates through 180


°

, and provides a 270


°

 × 360


°

 coverage of the hemisphere above the scanner and a portion of the hemisphere below (a 90


°

 cone directly beneath the scanner remains unscanned; [22]). The height of the scanner in this study was set at slightly above breast height, in terms of diameter-at-breast-height (DBH; 1.3 m above ground). A maximum of two returns are collected for each lidar pulse from the system. The specifications of the CBL are presented in Table 2 [26].", 2. Data, 2.3. The Compact Biomass Lidar (CBL),2
289,"The first pre-processing step involved noise reduction the TLS point cloud data, since the complicated structure of this forest resulted in many noisy returns in the point clouds. For example, the polar scan location right above the scanner is always highly oversampled, due to the various 270

°

 scan. We therefore downsampled the point clouds using an algorithm based on the spherical sampling of the data points, in order to avoid any bias in our data. This technique uses a range-based weighting function, i.e., smaller weights for closer and higher weights for further removed scan locations [27]. Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR) was used as an additional step during the noise reduction process [28]. SOR calculates the distance of each point to its neighbors and removes those that are further away. The distance between the points is compared, based on the average distance between points in the point cloud. The number of neighbors chosen in this research was five, which was obtained based on the density of the points in the vegetation structures we needed to maintain, and it allowed us to preserve these structural components and remove most of the noise points. Next, we used a connected component labeling algorithm for detecting more dense structures and removing irrelevant points, especially in the lower canopy where the structural complexity and the plant/point density were higher. Connected component labeling, which is also known as blob or region extraction, is an algorithm application of graph theory, where segments of connected components are labeled similarly [29]. Connected component labeling detects connected regions in images, and can be used in 3D form for point clouds. This algorithm segments the point cloud into smaller parts that are separated by a minimum distance; in this study, we used a grid size of 0.15 m for our segmentation. This value was chosen based on the point density of the vegetation structures from the lower portion of the point cloud, like stems and ferns. Connected component labeling was effective at removing the irrelvant (noise) lidar points, with the resulting segments including the actual forest structures of interest. This stage was critical because, even after SOR was applied, there were still some noise points remaining in the areas where the point cloud was dense and contained more complex, sub-canopy level, and arguably irrelevant structures, in terms of the study’s objective (LAI estimation).", 3. Methods, 3.1. Point Cloud Denoising,3
290,"Detection of the higher canopy was achieved via normal change rate assessment. As mentioned earlier, the more the surface structure changes in adjacent points in the lidar point cloud, the more their normals are oriented differently, or the more variable these normals become. Figure 3 shows the result of the segmentation of the higher canopy in one of the scans. It is important to mention that, in some of the plots, due to the very complex vegetation structures (e.g., irregular stem or branch shapes), we needed to manually remove some of the points that were incorrectly segmented as higher canopy. This step of the algorithm can in future research be improved by deriving more geometric features for differentiating the canopy from other segments of the point cloud.", 3. Methods, 3.2. Detecting the Canopy,3
291,"After segmenting the higher canopy regions of the plots, using the previously mentioned normal change rate assessment technique, and in order to perform the voxel-based approach for LAD measurement, we divided the canopy point cloud into layers in the Z direction. Each layer then was divided into other layers in the X direction, in order to decrease the computational time and also the confusion for our algorithm, which can be caused by excessively large numbers of points and a broad density distribution. The number of layers in the Z direction were chosen to be five because this number provided us with a narrower range of density distributions in each layer, where the difference between the maximum and minimum point density was much lower than that for the whole canopy point cloud. This reduces the computational time and confusion for our algorithm. As a result, we can state that:

where 

Δ

 is the height of each layer, 

z

 is the maximum height of the points in the canopy, and 

z
min

 is the minimum height of the points segmented as the canopy. Voxel size is a critical parameter that can affect the performance of the algorithm. We observed that larger voxels in the areas with a higher number of points can lead to an underestimation of the number of leaf points, whereas smaller voxels in regions where there are fewer points can lead to an overestimation of the density in these areas. The mentioned factors can introduce extreme outliers into our model. As a result, we determined the voxel sizes in the X direction based on the number of points in each voxel and by using inter-quartile analysis. In each plot, we used the layer containing the highest number of points for finding the voxel sizes. A third degree polynomial, shown by the following equation, was fitted to the density distribution of the layer:

Afterwards, we determine the corresponding X value at this density, either higher or lower than the X at the maximum, depending on whether the maximum is on the right or left of the median, respectively.After determining the width of the first two voxels, we found the number of points in each and introduced the threshold used for detecting the voxel sizes, as the average of these two voxels:

 are the number of points in the first two voxels and the Nth is set as the threshold used for finding the voxel sizes in the X direction. The next step involves calculating the width of the voxels based on this threshold, meaning that each voxel should contain a number of points equal to Nth. It is important to mention that, in the far ends of the point cloud, where the point density is significantly lower, if the number of points were less than one third of the threshold (

N
th

), we merged that region with the previous one, thereby forming one voxel. This is due to the fact that a small number of points result in an excessively narrow and inaccurate density distribution. Table 3 shows the statistics for the voxel sizes.", 3. Methods, 3.3. Finding Voxel Sizes,3
292,"The backscattered power (intensity) from woody materials in the shortwave-infrared (SWIR), i.e., the spectral region roughly between 1400–2500 nm, is higher than the power returned from leaves, due to the liquid water absorption by leaves [30]. The CBL operates at a wavelength of 905 nm, and, although the difference in intensities in foliar and woody materials at 905 nm is not as noticeable as in the SWIR region, there is still a higher intensity recorded for the stems and branches. Additionally, the leaves in the higher canopy of the HAVO site, visible in the lidar point cloud, are mostly flat and horizontally oriented. The scanned area of the leaves decrease dramatically further away from the scanner, multiplied by the cosine of the scan angle. However, due to the cylindrical shape of the branches and their relatively vertical structure, their scanned area is relatively consistent along the scene. The angular distribution of some of the detected branches was found to be between 72


°

 to 121


°

, while the angular distribution of the leaves, which was derived from facets of the manually-detected leaf point clouds, was found to be between 11


°

 and 

−

23
°


 [31]. This shows that the leaves are more horizontally oriented in this scene. As a result, we can assume that the total scanned area of the leaves is lower than for the stems and branches, especially in regions further from the scanner.We also incorporated the images resulting from the intensity images of the point clouds, recorded by the scanner, in order to detect some of the branches and leaves accurately. We were able to detect points that were definitively branches and others that were leaves, purely by detecting the intensity image edges and “outlining” the original image. This was done using the Canny edge detection algorithm [32]. In this approach, a Gaussian filter first is applied to the image to reduce noise, after which the intensity gradient of the image is produced. Non-maximum suppression is applied afterwards to remove the incorrectly detected edges; this algorithm operates by finding the main edges and removing detected edges that do not exhibit a strong connectivity to the main edges. We then measured the density of the detected foliar and woody regions. This was done for twenty plots and 40 segments of leaves and branches in each plot. We found that the density of the branches was higher than that for the leaves by an average order of magnitude of 10 in all of the 20 selected plots. These results support our hypothesis that one will observe a higher lidar point density for branch regions, when compared to foliar materials in TLS point clouds.Finally, we calculated the volume density, i.e., the number of points in a known volume, in each of the canopy voxels. The first issue is the grid size, which is used for measuring the density. We manually investigated 110 random plots from the original 242 plots. The average width of the biggest branch in the lowest portion of the higher canopy was found to be 0.09 m. Consequently, we chose the grid size to be 0.1 m on each side. In other words, in each of the voxels, the volume density in a 3D grid with the size of 0.1 m was measured.", 3. Methods, 3.4. Measuring the Volume Density,3
293,"The next stage constitutes a seminal step in the process, namely the segmentation of leaves from branches, accomplished by setting a threshold for the density values in each voxel. We thus fitted a kernel density estimator to the density histogram in each voxel. In probability theory and statistics, Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is a continuous and non-parametric approach for estimating the probability density function of a random variable [33]. KDE is used when no assumptions are made regarding the form of the data distribution, which is the case in our study. KDE can be estimated using the following formula:

where n is the number of points, K is the kernel, and h is the bandwidth, which is a smoothing parameter in the KDE formula. The density threshold was obtained based on half of the area under the KDE curve. Figure 4 shows an example from one of the distributions and the threshold chosen, based on the area under the curve.The points that have lower density values than the threshold are labeled as leaves, while those points above the threshold were labeled as non-leaves (woody material). We modeled the LAI using these leaf point densities, with the results presented in the next section. KDE Bandwidth SelectionThe bandwidth, or bin size, is an important parameter when using KDE. The bandwidth can be estimated using Silverman’s (1986) rule of thumb. The formula for the bandwidth derived with this method is presented below:

In the case of direct estimation of the LAI values obtained from our TLS data analysis, we ran the algorithm on all 242 plots and achieved an average accuracy of 90%, ranging from 79% to 97%.

 is the TLS-derived LAI value in each plot. The RMSE value for LAI assessment was 0.31, with an overestimation of

%

 for the average lidar-derived LAI, compared to the field-measured LAI. We also found the accuracy was lower in the plots where the canopy structural complexity is higher, i.e., the vegetation density is higher in the canopy, especially in the lower portion of the canopy which decreases the lidar beam penetration to the higher levels of the canopy. We refer to “complexity” in this scenario in terms of canopy “density”, i.e., expressed via the number of lidar pulses returned at specific vertical strata throughout the canopy, and their inherent impact on transmission of laser pulses to higher strata; specific examples are provided in the Discussion section. This issue introduces challenges to the leaf detection algorithm and associated LAI estimation. The obtained accuracy shows that this approach can be used for estimating LAI values in a complex forest environment, especially since an error <

10
%

 generally is acceptable in natural resource studies (see [34]).In the case of modeling the LAI using the leaf point densities, we achieved an 

R
2

 value of 0.88. The leaf point densities in each voxel in this case were calculated as the mean of the densities of the points labeled as leaves. Figure 8 shows the linear model obtained from this analysis. However, this latter analysis assumed no spatial auto-correlation between the 5 m-spaced scans, which necessitated an additional step to evaluate the robustness of our approach.We next performed semi-variogram analysis to evaluate the spatial dependence between the field-measured LAI values, since the field-measured LAI arguably cannot be considered spatially independent across all of the 242 field plots. A semi-variogram is measured for two points separated at a distance of h using the following formula [35]:

Figure 9 shows the result of the semi-variogram analysis.We found that the LAI values are spatially independent for plots spaced more than 30 m apart, based on the semi-variogram analysis. Consequently, we divided the 242 plots into six different data sets, each random iteration containing the plots that had a 30-m between-plot spacing. The LAI values in each of these sets were modeled using the derived leaf densities, and the 

R
2

 values ranged from 0.84–0.96; Figure 10 shows the six linear models. The linear models for these subsets of data show that the algorithm performs well for the regions, even where the LAI can be considered spatially independent.", 4. Results and Discussion, 4.1. Results,4
297,"The presented approach provides a method for automatic leaf detection and LAI assessment, an important parameter in structural evaluation of vegetation, for what could be considered complex forest environments. This algorithm reduces the time and cost associated with data collection for LAI assessment, and provides the ability to assess canopy-level structural attributes, which can be manually impractical due to the structural complexity of many forest environments. This study therefore contributes to plot-level assessment of canopy structural attributes, such as LAI and LAD, using a low-cost, portable TLS, and it does so at high accuracy and precision rates. While previous studies have shown that the higher-density TLS data can provide accurate estimations of LAI, using geometrical attributes of the canopy and directional gap fraction assessment [36,37], the lower-density data used in this work, in terms of lower angular resolution of the scanner and lower associated lidar point density, reduce the cost and time of data collection. However, low-density data make the derivation of geometric traits of the leaves and branches difficult and introduce associated challenges to structural assessment via TLS data. As an example, Antonarakis et al. [36] used a directional gap fraction approach to estimate LAI using TLS in three forests which consisted mostly of commercial hybrid poplars. While this method proved to be effective when using high-density data, low-density data do not allow an accurate assessment of canopy gap fraction, due to an inability to capture geometric characteristics of the intra-canopy structures, i.e., leaves and branches, and to evaluate their impact on the radiation transferred through the canopy. Our approach thus uses only one variable, namely lidar point density, to detect leaves, and to evaluate LAD and LAI. The lidar point densities are obtained using statistical analysis of the canopy lidar point cloud, without the need of additional geometric and structural parameters. In addition to the issues caused by low-density data, the structural complexity of the studied tropical forests, i.e., the vegetation density and associated lidar point density in the canopy at different vertical strata, introduces challenges to plot-level LAI assessment, when compared to evaluating LAI using a controlled laboratory experiment (e.g., [38]), or a single tree scan (e.g., [39]). Li et al. [39] developed a point cloud slicing approach based on the canopy gap fraction, and were successful in estimating LAI using a single-tree scan. Although an approach like the one used in our work may not provide results as accurate as the ones obtained using methods based on high-density data and single tree scans, our method estimates plot-level LAI, thus reduces the time and cost of data collection, which results in more practical applications of TLS in forest inventories. In another study, Olsoy et al. [40] used TLS to model LAI in 42 Wyoming big sagebrush shrubs, using canopy cover, the percentage of the total ground area which is covered by the vertical projection of the tree crown, and canopy volume as TLS variables. They acquired an 

R
2

 value of 0.73 for modeling LAI using canopy cover and an 

R

 of 0.78 when modeling LAI using the canopy volume obtained based on a convex hull approach. Such a method can be effective in assessing LAI using small-range TLS data and single tree scans, while in our work we addressed these issues by developing a density-based approach for assessing the plot-level LAI, acquiring

 values in the range of 0.84 to 0.96. Additionally, the accuracy of canopy volume estimation can decrease when the structural complexity and vegetation density increases, and also in further ranges from the scanner, due to lower penetration rate of lidar pulses in those regions and lower associated lidar point density [41]. TLS data and voxel-based approaches, like the one presented in our work, also have been used for LAI assessment in relatively recent studies. Greaves et al. [42] used a voxel counting approach for LAI estimation in low-stature (<1.5 m tall) Arctic shrub species. In this method, the TLS point cloud is divided into voxels, and then the number of voxels that are occupied by at least one point are counted and the number of these voxels per unit ground area provides the LAI estimate (

 = 0.94 for close range (2 m) TLS data). While this approach is successful in LAI estimation of low-stature species, TLS data used in our work are from tropical forests with the maximum TLS point cloud height ranging from 13 m to 18 m. As a result, such a method, solely based on voxel counting, can in fact lead to PAI, instead of LAI, due to the inability to differentiate between leaves and branches. Zheng et al. [43] found that the nonphotosynthetic canopy components, e.g., branches, contributed from 19% to 54% to LAI estimation depending on canopy vegetation densities. Therefore, the density-based approach presented in our work for detecting leaves in low-density data increases the plot-level LAI estimation accuracy in forest environments with dense vegetation, such as tropical forests.We did, however, observe an overestimation of 9% for the average lidar-derived LAI, compared to the field-measured LAI. This slight discrepancy was partly attributed to the fact that the field-measured LAI is highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of the location where the measurement is collected, while the TLS-derived LAI depends on the overall canopy-level spatial and structural attributes. Although the algorithm proved effective in achieving its objective, the performance is affected by the structural complexity in the canopy point cloud, specifically vegetation density. It was found that the accuracy of LAI estimation decreases, coupled to increases in vegetation density, especially in the lower part of the canopy. These more complex, higher density lower-canopy regions effectively reduce the penetration rate of lidar pulses to the higher regions of the canopy, thereby resulting in associated lower LAI assessment accuracy. As an example, in the plot where we obtained the lowest LAI estimation accuracy, 79%, the point density of the lowest layer in the Z direction was 2.21 times the second lowest layer, and the density in the second lowest layer was 1.74 times the third one. This results in a distinct decrease in lidar point density in different height levels of the canopy, which is a result of lower lidar beam penetration due to higher vegetation density in the canopy, whereas, in the plot in which we acquired the highest accuracy of LAI estimation, 97%, the point density of the lowest layer in Z direction was 1.19 times the second lowest layer, and the point density of the second lowest layer was 1.22 of the third one. This shows that, in such plots, there is a higher point density throughout the whole canopy point cloud, which results in a more accurate estimation of LAI. To address this issue, future research can incorporate a fusion of airborne lidar and TLS data to mitigate the impact of lower-canopy structural complexity on lidar pulse penetration throughout the canopy, and thereby hypothetically increase the accuracy of such LAI assessment approaches.We also showed that a robust approach, i.e., one that incorporates spatial auto-correlation considerations, did not result in significantly poorer LAI assessment performance. In fact, our full 242 plot set

 value of 0.88 for LAI modeling represented the range of

 values for the spatially-uncorrelated sets (

 = 0.84–0.96). This implies that, in practice, one could optimize or improve LAI assessments by evaluating the spatial auto-correlation of canopy structure variables, and then develop statistically-reliable, valid estimates for the main parameter of interest (LAI). It also could be argued that such an approach improved estimates, i.e., we achieved 

R

 values as high as 0.96, by constraining our modeling to spatially-independent regions within the forest. We therefore recommend that future efforts also include an investigation into how such a spatial statistics approach applies to potential predictor variables, such as leaf density, gap fraction, etc., over and above the dependent variable (LAI).Future research, over and above the previously-mentioned topics, can include the use of a dual- or multi-wavelength scanner in order to better differentiate foliar and woody materials and thereby improve algorithm performance. If the scanner wavelength is located in the SWIR spectral region, e.g., 1520 nm, we expect to see a better separation between the leaf and non-leaf (woody) segments. This is due to the larger difference in moisture-impacted reflectance values of these two materials in the SWIR wavelength range. As an example, Zhao et al. [44] used the dual wavelength Echidna lidar (DWEL; [30]), which collects data in two different wavelengths (1064 nm and 1548 nm), to measure the effective LAI. Such a system typically enables better discrimination between reflectance values of woody and foliar materials in the canopy, due to its ability to collect lidar data in the SWIR spectral region. The Echidna also yields higher density point clouds, with an angular step width of approximately 1 mrad, compared to the discrete lidar system used in this work, the CBL, with a minimum angular step width of 4.6 mrad.", 4. Results and Discussion, 4.2. Discussion,4
298,"We presented an algorithm for modelling and estimating the LAI in a complex, tropical forest environment using lidar point densities, derived from TLS data. The data used in this study were from a portable (3.2 kg), rapid-scan (33 s), low-cost (USD 20,000) TLS system. We assumed that the intensity (or power) returned to the scanner from woody materials is higher than for the leaves at 905 nm, and supported this hypothesis by investigating the point cloud density, both in foliar and woody segments. We acquired an accuracy of 90%, and RMSE value of 0.31 in directly estimating the field-measured LAI, using LAD assessment, and

9
%

 was found in the TLS-derived LAI compared to the field-measured LAI. This was attributed to the fact that TLS-derived LAI considers overall canopy-level structural attributes, while the field-measured LAI is sensitive to the spatial characteristics (angular canopy interactions, illumination conditions, etc.) of the specific location where the LAI is measured. The data in this study were from an arguably complex forest type, which makes each step of this approach more challenging. However, this algorithm works well in predicting the LAI using just one variable, namely leaf point density. We also considered the fact that the LAI values may not be spatially independent across the whole scene. As a result, by using semi-variogram analysis, we found that this approach works well for spatially-independent LAI values as well. This algorithm works well for automatic detection of leaf points in lower-density TLS lidar data. However, when higher-density (small angular resolution, high point density) lidar data are available, the geometric information of the leaves and branches potentially can be used to improve the leaf detection algorithm.This algorithm can be used for evaluating LAI in complex forest environments and when derivation of the geometric information and structure from the data are not practicable, due to low scanner angular resolution (and associated point cloud densities) or limited structural retrievals of the scanned site. Finally, such a rapid-scan, fine-scale approach to LAI assessment could prove useful to the larger community when it comes to calibration/validation of landscape-to-regional scale products, derived from airborne- and spaceborne platforms.

299,"As forest ecosystems are pushed toward novel conditions by anthropogenic disturbance and environmental change, there is an increasing need for information on the spatial distribution and condition of forest resources as a basis for quantifying ecosystem services, evaluating and forecasting change, and planning management actions. Field data and specifically forest inventory measurements can provide great detail at high accuracy, but are collected from a sample of small plots. Observational data are needed across scales relevant to forest policy and management, and commensurate with drivers of change acting over local to global scales (e.g., non-native pests, market conditions, climate change). Consequently, forest conditions are mapped from empirical relationships between field measurements and remote sensing data, often using some form of regression algorithm (e.g., [1,2,3,4,5,6]). Spatial heterogeneity of forests and uncertainty in remotely sensed predictor variables, however, can cause patterns of prediction error that may be detrimental to map use [6,7,8].At moderate spatial resolutions, a prominent source of uncertainty in predictor variables may be physical differences in measurements between field plots and image pixels [7]. Whereas the ideal remotely sensed predictor data would represent the same ground area as reference plot data, scale and location mismatches introduce uncertainty. Forest inventory measurements are typically obtained over plots that are a fraction of the size of moderate resolution image pixels. For example, the Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) Program of the U.S. Forest Service provides measurements from a national network of field plots, each composed of a cluster of four subplots [9]. An FIA plot samples an area roughly equivalent to a 3 × 3 neighborhood of 30 m Landsat pixels. The actual area measured within subplots however, collectively equates to only 8% of that pixel neighborhood. Average conditions across a pixel neighborhood likely will not correspond to those measured at FIA subplots [7,8]. Image georeferencing or registration error coupled with GPS error in plot coordinates further interferes with the physical correspondence of pixels and plots [7]. Potentially compounding these problems are differences in timing between image acquisitions and plot measurements and additional sources of predictor uncertainty associated with remote sensing platforms, instrumentation, viewing conditions, and data handling.Without correcting for uncertainty in predictor variables, regression algorithms generally assign variation in the predictors to variation in the response given the predictors. Minimization of prediction error when fitting regression models thereafter leads to underestimation of the strength of the relationship between predictors and response, and a characteristic pattern of prediction error where low values tend to be overestimated, high values underestimated, and variability suppressed. This pattern of error is known as regression dilution or attenuation bias [10,11]. In the presence of predictor variable uncertainty, reduction of total error tends to cause elevated attenuation bias. Attenuation is perhaps most detrimental to applications that are specifically dependent upon or influenced by patterns of prediction at high or low values, although more generally, the effects of attenuation bias may be difficult to identify or correct.Attenuation bias is a long-recognized problem in remote sensing [12], but there remain few options available for its reduction or correction. Rejou-Mechain et al. [8] emphasized the importance of attenuation bias in the estimation of aboveground biomass by regression against field plot measurements, and demonstrated that established statistical approaches to reducing bias may be inadequate. Xu et al. [7] asserted that attenuation bias is a pervasive problem in remote sensing of forest attributes and suggested that no analytical method was capable of eliminating this bias. After analyzing causes using simple error models, they suggested that field data be collected over an area similar to the size of pixels or pixel neighborhoods used for prediction. Yet they also demonstrated that location mismatches can cause severe attenuation regardless. Robinson et al. [13] recognized strong attenuation bias when estimating aboveground biomass from FIA plot data and airborne radar, and suggested that FIA plots may not provide suitable reference observations. However, FIA or similar inventory data provide statistically representative and quality assured measurements that are commonly used for model training, though often resulting in patterns of error consistent with attenuation bias (e.g., [1,2,14,15,16,17]). A number of approaches have been advanced to reduce attenuation bias in parametric species distribution models, using error-in-variables [18] or Bayesian methods [19,20]. These approaches, however, are not always tractable for remote sensing applications, which frequently utilize very large sets of predictor variables.Here we present an approach to the reduction of attenuation bias using support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs were originally developed for binary classification but have been widely applied to regression problems and remote sensing applications [21,22]. SVMs require the specification of several free parameters that determine model fit. Optimal values are problem-specific, varying with the available training data and predictor variables. SVM parameterization is therefore equivalent to a search for an optimal combination of values within a multidimensional search space. The complexity of the problem is further increased if the search is expanded to include the selection of a subset of predictor variables. Variable selection may reduce computational complexity and improve model fit [23], and because different predictor variables may be subject to different levels of measurement error, variable selection may also reduce systematic error. Similar benefits may follow from the selection of a subset of available training data [24]. Ideally, all aspects of model specification are performed simultaneously, and several classes of optimization or search algorithms are suitable, including genetic algorithms (GAs; e.g., [25,26,27,28]). Using a guided search mechanism founded on the analogy of evolution by natural selection, GAs are capable of obtaining near-optimal solutions from a large and complex search space [29]. Because attenuation arises from the minimization of error when fitting regression models in the presence of predictor variable uncertainty, we approached SVM model training and model selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, simultaneously minimizing total and systematic error using a multi-objective GA [30]. Our goal was to obtain solutions with reduced systematic error at acceptable levels of total error.Our interest in attenuation bias stemmed from the need to map individual tree species distributions to improve knowledge of current forest conditions and to forecast future conditions in the Acadian Forest of northern Maine (USA). Reliable predictions of tree species distributions are needed, and patterns of species dominance or codominance are particularly important. We applied our multi-objective support vector regression (MOSVR) method to the prediction of forest tree species relative abundance (proportion of aboveground live biomass) in the Acadian Forest using multitemporal Landsat imagery and topoclimatic variables. We evaluated species dominance and codominance in terms of ranked relative abundance, and compared relative abundance and dominance/codominance predictions against those of other commonly used modeling approaches including random forests and nearest neighbor methods. Results indicated that MOSVR provides an effective approach to the reduction of attenuation bias.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
300,"The Acadian Forest Region of the northeastern U.S. occupies a transition zone between the northern boreal forest and the southern temperate deciduous-dominant forest [31], and includes approximately 4 Mha of nearly contiguous, undeveloped forestland across northern and western Maine. Our 1.9 Mha study region (Figure 1) was defined by the overlap of Landsat Worldwide Reference System path 12, row 28 and the political boundary between northwestern Maine and Quebec, Canada. Topography is generally flat or rolling with occasional low mountains and an extensive network of rivers, lakes, and wetlands. Tree species diversity is relatively high as the northern limit of southern species overlaps with the southern limit of northern species [32].Forest type distributions are associated with climatic gradients, topo-edaphic conditions, and disturbance history [33]. Northern hardwood species (Acer saccharum, Betula alleghaniensis, Fagus grandifolia) predominate across lower hilltops and at mid-slope. Spruce-fir species (Abies balsamea, Picea rubens, P. mariana) predominate where soil or microclimatic conditions exclude the more demanding hardwoods. Mixedwood stands commonly occur along ecotones or as a result of succession following disturbance. Shade-intolerant hardwood species (Betula papyrifera, Populus spp.) are commonly found following intense disturbance.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area,2
301,"Predictive models of species relative abundance are based on reference data provided by the USFS FIA Program. The contemporary network of field plots adheres to an equal probability sampling design, with plots randomly located within 2428 ha hexagonal tiles [9]. The FIA program maintains the confidentiality of true plot locations to protect the privacy of landowners and to preserve plot integrity [34]. True locations were made available for use through a collaborative agreement with the USFS Northern Research Station FIA Program. Tree measurement data were used to calculate species relative abundance as a proportion of estimated live aboveground biomass (stems >2.54 cm diameter, measured at 1.37 m; DRYBIO_AG variable [35]). Since 1999, 20% of plots within Maine have been surveyed annually during 5-year inventory cycles [9].Our intention was to map forest conditions of the early or mid-2000s to support analysis of recent change as well as forecasting of future conditions. We collected Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery acquired at different times throughout the growing season (late April through early October) to exploit species-specific phenological patterns as a basis for improving species predictions. Frequent and extensive cloud cover dictated the use of both TM and ETM+ images, and we elected to use ETM+ images acquired during the early 2000s prior to the failure of the ETM+ scan line corrector. We selected eight relatively cloud- and snow-free images acquired from 2001-2006, roughly matching a 5-year FIA inventory cycle (Table 1). Images were obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science Center and the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics Consortium at 30 m resolution with standard terrain correction applied. Bands 1-5 and 7 (visible and reflective infrared) were extracted for further processing and converted to top-of-atmosphere reflectance to facilitate cloud masking and interpretation of pixel values during image preparation (conversion was not required for predictive modeling). Clouds and cloud shadows were masked using a semi-automated procedure developed in-house, verified and corrected by visual interpretation and on-screen digitization. Visible snow cover in early-season imagery was masked by unsupervised classification using an ISODATA algorithm and visual interpretation of snow-covered classes. Images were then corrected for topographic illumination effects using the SCS+C algorithm [36], with slope and aspect calculated from the 1 arc-second (30 m) National Map Seamless Digital Elevation Model maintained by the USGS [37].Forest canopy change during the 5-year observation period dissociated image characteristics from field measurements at affected plot locations. We therefore masked locations of apparent canopy cover change using available leaf-on images acquired in 2001, 2004, and 2007 (Table 1). The iteratively-reweighted multivariate alteration detection transformation [38] was applied to 2001–2004 and 2004–2007 image pairs to estimate a probability of spectral change during each interval. Intervals were combined by selecting the maximum probability of change, and a threshold was selected so that 20% of forest pixels were identified as change pixels. Threshold selection was based on visual inspection of the resulting 2001-2007 change mask against Landsat imagery, which indicated close correspondence with canopy disturbance and visible regrowth in previously disturbed stands.Additional spatial predictor variables included climate and terrain attributes thought to be relevant to tree establishment or growth. Terrain data included 10 morphometry, 8 lighting/visibility, and 11 hydrology variables (Table 2) calculated from the 1 arc-second (30 m) National Map Seamless Digital Elevation Model and the National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses [39]. Elevation data was smoothed with a Gaussian filter to reduce the effects of random error and systematic artifacts (circular filter element, radius = 90 m, σ = 1.5). Terrain slope, aspect, and curvature were calculated from a second-order polynomial fit [40]. Direct insolation was calculated at mid-month, April-September, by assuming a uniform 65% atmospheric transmittance, a value that produced insolation estimates in good agreement with a previously published regional climate model [41]. Hydrology variables including catchment area, flow path length, and distance to stream channel were calculated using a bidimensional flow routing algorithm [42] after filling sinks in the elevation data [43]. Synthetic stream channel networks were derived from the catchment area raster after masking and dilating NHD water bodies using a 5 × 5 filter element. The dilated water body mask reduced the tendency for channels to initiate near the edges of water bodies, where the flow routing algorithm produced large estimates of flow accumulation. Climate data were obtained from the USDA Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station, Moscow Forestry Sciences Laboratory, and included 17 variables (Table 2) derived from monthly temperature and precipitation surfaces interpolated from weather station data for the climate normal period of 1961–1990 [44,45]. Climate data were available at approximately 1 km spatial resolution.Predictor variable values were extracted at forested FIA plots. Landsat and terrain data were compiled by averaging values from forest pixels within 3 × 3 neighborhoods surrounding plot centers; climate predictor data were extracted as 1 km pixel values. Forest pixels were differentiated from non-forest using the 1993 Maine Gap Analysis Program (GAP) land cover map, augmented with the agricultural classes of the 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD). The 1993 GAP map differentiated forest from non-forest with an estimated 100% accuracy in our study area [49]. Incorporation of the 2001 NLCD agricultural classes accounted for a small amount of land cover change predating our 2001-2006 observation period. SVMs are generally incapable of working with incomplete predictor data and for the purposes of algorithm development and evaluation, we elected to exclude samples with missing data due to forest cover change, cloud/shadow cover, or snow cover rather than incorporate an additional algorithm for imputing missing data. Remaining plot locations yielded a training/validation data set consisting of 349 samples.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Reference and Predictor Data,2
302,"Our implementation of a multi-objective SVR (MOSVR) algorithm is based on ε-SVR with a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel, and includes parameter selection (γ, ε, and C), variable selection, and a form of training sample selection. The kernel function accommodates nonlinear relationships through the projection of training data into a space of high dimensionality. The RBF kernel typically performs well due to several computational and practical advantages over other functions, including the need to specify only a single free parameter, the kernel width γ [22,50]. Narrower RBF kernels essentially permit the projection of training data into higher dimensions, corresponding to more complex solutions when expressed in the original variable space. The ε-SVR formulation is based on the so-called ε-insensitive loss function, where a margin of width ε bounds the regression function, with nonzero loss applied only to training samples lying outside the margin (the support vectors, or SVs). Narrower margins generally correspond to larger numbers of SVs and more complex solutions. The regularization or penalty error parameter C specifies a trade-off between model complexity and training error. The parameters ϵ, C, and γ collectively determine the complexity of the regression function and its ability to generalize to new data [50]. Optimal values are problem-specific, varying with the available training data and predictor variables. MOSVR executes a simultaneous search for parameter values, predictor variable subsets, and training sample subsets. Our approach to training sample selection is to specify a subset of reference samples as eligible for exclusion from model training. However, all reference samples are used for model validation.Use of a GA requires the expression of individual models in the form of a genotype subject to selection, genetic recombination, and mutation. Each SVR model is represented by a bit string chromosome, composed of segments encoding parameter values, variable selection, and sample exclusion (Figure 2). The lengths of segments representing parameter values determine the levels of precision with which real values are represented by binary encoding. Variable selection is encoded as a bit string segment with length equal to the number of available predictor variables, interpreted as a binary mask. Sample exclusion is similarly encoded as a segment with length equal to the number of samples made eligible for exclusion, indicating specific samples to be excluded from model training. Note however, that all samples are used for model validation within a cross-validation (CV) procedure. The GA is initiated with a uniform random population of a user-specified size.Numerous multi-objective GAs have been published and reviewed [30]. Our approach is based on the popular NSGA-II algorithm [51] implemented in the MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox, Release 2014a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). The LIBSVM open source software [52] is used for SVM training and prediction. The MATLAB implementation of NSGA-II acts as a wrapper for LIBSVM. A diagrammatic representation of algorithm details is provided in Figure 3.For each generation of solutions, NSGA-II differentiates groups of parents (P) and offspring (Q) of equal size. Initially all individuals are random and specification of P0 and Q0 is arbitrary. The chromosome representing each member of the current population (Pt ∪ Qt) is decoded into real-valued SVM parameters and variable selection and sample exclusion masks. Individual models are trained and validated by a k-fold CV. Continuous variables are scaled to unit range ([0, 1]) at each CV iteration. The CV procedure is repeated a user-specified number of times and results averaged to reduce the uncertainty of objective function estimates [53].CV estimates of objective function values are assigned to each member of the current population. Objective functions quantify total error (RMSET) and systematic error (RMSESYS):

 and observed values yi [54]. The objective functions map solutions into a two-dimensional objective space Φ = {g1(p) g2(p) | p ϵ Ω}, where Ω is the set of all possible solutions. Solution pi is said to dominate solution pj provided g1(pi) ≤ g1(pj) and g2(pi) ≤ g2(pj) with at least one strict inequality. In other words, one solution dominates another if it is better in one objective and at least as good in the other. A solution is nondominated if neither objective can be improved further without a worsening of the other. The set of nondominated solutions in Ω is referred to as the Pareto set, and the image of the Pareto set in the objective space Φ is the Pareto front. The goal of NSGA-II is to closely approximate the true Pareto set by driving evolution toward the Pareto front.At each generation, NSGA-II sorts the current population of solutions (Pt ∪ Qt) into a sequence of nondominated fronts (F1, F2,…). The first front F1 includes all nondominated solutions from the total population and is the current best approximation of the Pareto front. Once F1 is obtained, these solutions are removed from the population, and the next front F2 is obtained as nondominated solutions from the reduced population. The process is iterated until all population members have been assigned to a front. NSGA-II subsequently identifies one half of the population as the next generation of parents (Pt+1), selecting solutions from successive fronts. In the MATLAB implementation, the maximum number of parent solutions selected from F1 and successive fronts is constrained in order to promote population diversity throughout algorithm execution. Within any individual front, parent solutions are selected from sparse or less crowded portions of the front to further promote population diversity.The next generation of offspring (Qt+1, equal in size to Pt+1) are obtained through genetic recombination and mutation of parent solutions. A user-specified proportion of offspring are produced through genetic recombination of a pair of parent solutions, and the remainder through mutation of a single parent. Individual parents are identified by tournament selection [55], where a user-specified number of solutions are randomly selected from Pt+1 and the best is selected as a parent. Better solutions lie on lower ranked fronts and in less crowded regions along their front. Genetic recombination occurs through a crossover operation in which an offspring is constructed from bit string segments copied from its parents. Different crossover operations determine the manner in which information is exchanged and the potential degree of novelty introduced through exchange [55]. An offspring produced by mutation is a copy of its parent subjected to a mutation operation that switches individual bit values with a user-specified probability. Once offspring have been produced, parent and offspring chromosomes (Pt+1 ∪ Qt+1) are decoded and the process repeats over a user-specified number of generations. At the final generation, members of F1 are retrained using all available training samples and returned as a set of Pareto optimal models expressing tradeoffs between RMSET and RMSESYS.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Multi-Objective SVR (MOSVR) Algorithm Description,2
303,"From the FIA data compiled for our study area, we modeled and mapped the relative abundance of 13 tree species (Table 3). SVR parameter values were constrained within reasonable ranges (log(γ) ϵ [–4,0]; log(C) ϵ [–1,3]; log(ϵ) ϵ [–4,0]). A set of 78 reference samples was made eligible for exclusion from model training, including plots with non-forest cover types identified by FIA records and plots with high spectral variability (based on neighborhood standard deviations, averaged across all images and bands). We retained samples for which FIA records indicated multiple forest types. All reference samples were used for model validation in a 10-fold, 10 times repeated CV.We set GA parameters in an effort to balance the promotion of population diversity against execution time. The population size was set to 500, with a maximum of 20% of solutions maintained on the approximate Pareto front. Parents were selected by tournament with 10 participants. 70% of offspring were generated by crossover of parent chromosomes, using the MATLAB scattered crossover operation in which bits were selected from each parent at random. 30% of offspring were generated by mutation of parents, with a mutation rate of 2.5%. Approximate Pareto fronts typically stabilized by 80-100 generations, and algorithm execution was limited to 120 generations.The estimation of RMSESYS by linear least squares regression of CV predictions onto observed values was in some cases sensitive to outlying samples whose CV predictions deviated strongly from those of other samples with similar observed values. In these cases, removal of influential outliers was required to ensure that a small number of samples did not drive the GA toward less desirable solutions, where reduced RMSESYS reflected the presence of influential outliers rather than trends across the larger set of reference data. We implemented an automated outlier removal strategy at 30, 60, and 90 generations based on the identification of influential outliers for each member of the F1 front. Outlying samples were identified by applying a threshold to absolute studentized residuals. Influential outliers were identified as those whose removal resulted in a change in RMSESYS exceeding a threshold level, when expressed as a proportion of RMSET. Samples identified as influential outliers in the majority of F1 solutions were removed from both training and validation data. For most species, we applied a residual threshold of 3 and a RMSESYS threshold of 1%. For FRAXI, PIMA, and TSCA we used more conservative threshold values of 4 and 2% to reduce the number of outliers removed. The number of outliers removed for each species ranged from zero to seven, and averaged four (Supplementary Table S2).At the end of MOSVR execution, an individual solution was selected from the midsection of the Pareto front where solutions represented a compromise between RMSESYS and RMSET. We selected the model positioned nearest to the origin after unit-scaling RMSESYS and RMSET values to normalize for differences in magnitude between the two.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. MOSVR Algorithm Execution,2
304,"We compared MOSVR results to those obtained from random forest (RF) [56], gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) [16], and random forest nearest neighbor (RFNN) [57] algorithms. RF is an ensemble algorithm based on regression trees and has been widely applied in species distribution modeling and remote sensing applications. GNN was originally developed and has been commonly applied as a k = 1 nearest neighbor algorithm for modeling regional tree species distributions, with proximity calculated within a feature space defined by a canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of plot measurements and image or environmental predictor data. With k = 1, all observations from individual reference plots are imputed to pixels, retaining plot-level species associations in predictions. RFNN is another k = 1 nearest neighbor variant, with proximity obtained from the nodes of one or more RF models. RFNN shares the advantages of GNN, but is based on a novel, non-Euclidean proximity metric that may lead to improved outcomes [58].We adopted typical parameter settings and execution strategies using R v 3.0.3 [59]. RF models were fit with the R package randomForest, v 4.6-12 [60], with an ensemble size of 2000 and default parameter settings (mtry = one third of the number of predictor variables; nodesize = 5). For GNN, CCA models were first fit with the R package vegan, v 2.4-3 [61] using the relative abundance of all species as the multivariate response. Following Ohmann and Gregory [16], we performed a forward stepwise variable selection procedure based on AIC, permutation testing, and a check of variance inflation factors. Variables were considered for addition in the order of their contribution to constrained inertia (equivalent to AIC when all variables are continuous). Variables were added provided they were deemed significant by a permutation test (p = 0.01, 99 permutations) and all variance inflation factors remained below 20. Nearest neighbor imputation was based on Euclidean distance calculated from the first seven CCA axes (accounting for >95% of total variation explained), scaled by their constrained eigenvalues. GNN imputation, and execution of the RFNN algorithm, was performed using the R package yaImpute, v 1.0-26 [57]. The RFNN imputation was based on a combined nodes matrix obtained by three separate RF models, fit to total live aboveground biomass, the species with maximum relative abundance based on aboveground live biomass, and the relative abundance of that species.We also implemented a single-objective approach to SVR model training (SOSVR) using a traditional GA (MATLAB Global Optimization Toolbox, Release 2014a) minimizing RMSET, because SVR model selection is typically based on minimization of overall prediction error. Finally, to evaluate the relative benefits of variable and sample selection strategies employed by MOSVR, we compared results to two alternative MOSVR execution strategies that included parameter selection only, and parameter plus variable selection but no sample selection. All MOSVR execution strategies used the same GA settings and the same outlier removal strategy. SOSVR runs were executed using the same values for applicable GA settings, and included parameter, variable, and sample selection.Following model selection/parameterization, models of all types were run through a 10-fold CV 100 times with different random partitions to obtain mean model performance metrics from CV predictions. To ensure fair comparisons amongst model types, we removed CV predictions associated with influential outliers in MOSVR, on a species by species basis, ensuring equal validation samples. We compared mean model performance metrics (RMSET, RMSESYS, OLS linear slope, and R2) and 95% confidence intervals under the assumption that metrics obtained by repeated CV were approximately normal. We considered a species dominant if it occurred as one of the three most abundant species, and we calculated the frequencies with which any species or pair of species occurred as dominant or codominant. Mean dominance/codominance frequencies and corresponding 95% confidence intervals were obtained from CV predictions for each model type and compared to observed values.", 2.

305,"The approximate Pareto fronts obtained by MOSVR generally shared a common geometry. Solutions were distributed more or less evenly across a curvilinear front, with incremental change in one objective balanced by incremental change in the other (Figure 4a). At one end, models had low total error but comparatively high systematic error (e.g., Model 1), apparent as a deviation from the 1:1 relationship between predicted and observed values (Figure 4b). At the other end, models had low systematic error but comparatively high total error (e.g., Model 3, Figure 4d). Fronts were convex toward the origin (Figure 4a) such that nearer to either end the value of one objective function changed much more quickly than the other. Rather than select models with minimal systematic error from one end of the front, where small decreases in RMSESYS were associated with large increases in RMSET, we selected models from the midsection where prediction error represented more of a compromise between systematic and total error (e.g., Model 2, Figure 4c).Of the three MOSVR execution strategies evaluated, the least systematic error was typically attained through the simultaneous selection of parameter values, variables, and samples (Supplementary Table S1). In a number of cases, parameter and variable selection achieved similar levels of systematic error, and in one case significantly lower systematic error. However, in all of these cases total error exceeded that achieved when sample selection was used as well. Parameter selection alone failed to reduce systematic error to similar levels. All MOSVR results presented hereafter were obtained with parameter, variable, and sample selection.Several patterns appeared when comparing model performance metrics across model types and species (Figure 5). SOSVR attained the least total error for all but a single species (Figure 5a). The least systematic error, when expressed as a percentage of total error, was always attained by MOSVR (Figure 5b). The slope between predicted and observed values was also greatest (closest to one) for MOSVR models (Figure 5c). R2 values were generally greatest for MOSVR models as a result of reduced levels of systematic error, although the low total error attained by SOSVR resulted in R2 values as high or higher for some species (Figure 5d). In nearly all cases, nearest neighbor methods (GNN and RFNN) resulted in the greatest total error and RF models the greatest systematic error. Compared to MOSVR outcomes in which systematic error ranged from 10–42% of total error across species (mean = 27%), systematic error in RF models accounted for 62–93% of total error (mean = 83%). Systematic error in nearest neighbor methods ranged from 30–71% of total error (GNN mean = 58%; RFNN mean = 57%).Patterns of systematic error summarized by model performance metrics and consistent with attenuation bias were apparent in residuals. Species ABBA provides a representative example (Figure 6). All model types typically produced slight overestimation of relative abundance for observed values <0.2, although in this case overestimation by MOSVR was negligible for relative abundance >0.05. All model types produced a systematic underestimation of relative abundance for observed values >0.2. The magnitude of underestimation increased as observed relative abundance increased. The level of apparent error at high abundance varied between models, with GNN producing the most and MOSVR the least (Figure 6f). The degree to which MOSVR mitigated attenuation bias varied from species to species (Figure 7). However, MOSVR always reduced the magnitude of systematic underestimation at the high levels of relative abundance that would presumably most influence predicted patterns of dominance/codominance.Patterns of observed dominance and codominance largely reflected species associations expected in the most prevalent forest types of the region (Figure 8a, Table 3). Elevated dominance/codominance of ABBA and PIRU were consistent with a high prevalence of upland spruce-fir. Similarly, dominance/codominance of ACSA3 and BEAL2, and to a lesser extent FAGR which occurs at lower abundance across our study area (Table 3), reflected a high prevalence of northern hardwood. BEPA commonly occurs at relatively high abundance following intense disturbance, which is common throughout much of our study area. ACRU grows in high abundance under a wide range of conditions, often in disturbed areas. A number of species are either not prevalent or not generally found at high relative abundance within our study area (FRAXI, PIGL, PIMA, TSCA) (Table 3).Of the model types evaluated, nearest neighbor methods and RFNN in particular produced patterns of dominance and codominance that most closely conformed to those observed (Figure 8e,f). The maximum absolute difference between observed dominance/codominance frequencies and those predicted by GNN and RFNN was about 4% and 2%, respectively. Absolute differences averaged less than 1% for both. In contrast, both SOSVR and RF models resulted in predicted patterns that deviated from observations much more strongly (Figure 8c,d), with absolute differences averaging about 2% for each but exceeding 10% in a number of instances. The largest differences were over-estimates of codominance, and for RF several of these amounted to a near doubling of observed frequencies (e.g., ACRU and BEAL2, Figure 8d). MOSVR produced patterns much closer to those observed and to those predicted by the nearest neighbor methods, with a maximum absolute difference of about 6% and an average absolute difference of about 1%.", 3.

306,"Our goal was to develop a method of predicting individual tree species relative abundance from moderate resolution data at high accuracy and with low systematic error relative to other established approaches. Comparisons across 13 tree species indicated that our MOSVR algorithm accomplished that goal (Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7). As expected, algorithms that yielded the lowest total prediction error (RF and SOSVR) also produced the greatest systematic error, consistent with a strong attenuation bias arising from predictor variable uncertainty. Although these methods effectively minimized mean prediction error, they did so at the cost of systematic over- and underestimation at low and high ends of observed data distributions. Underestimation at high relative abundance in particular appears to have affected predicted patterns of species dominance and codominance, causing strong deviations from those observed at FIA plots (Figure 8c,d).In contrast, two k = 1 nearest neighbor methods (GNN and RFNN) reproduced observed dominance/codominance patterns with comparatively little error (Figure 8e,f). By simultaneously imputing reference measurements for all species, these methods retained plot-level relationships between species and reproduced dominance/codominance patterns most closely. However, total prediction error was comparatively high for individual species (Figure 5). Others have emphasized the strength of nearest neighbor methods in producing reliable community-level outcomes [16,62]. In this case, despite their reproduction of observed dominance/codominance frequencies, nearest neighbor methods yielded predictions of relative abundance with comparatively low accuracy, subject to strong attenuation bias.MOSVR produced the least systematic error for all species, at levels of total error that were always less than nearest neighbor methods and often comparable to either SOSVR or RF (Figure 5). Predicted dominance/codominance frequencies agreed with observations much more closely than SOSVR and RF, though not quite as well as GNN or RFNN (Figure 8). Ultimately, by reducing systematic error in individual species models, MOSVR balanced the benefits of GNN and RFNN against those of SOSVR and RF.MOSVR was able to achieve our primary objective of reducing systematic error by treating the minimization of both total and systematic error as model selection or tuning objectives within a multi-objective framework. Multi-objective model selection requires a statistical or machine learning model capable of generating diverse solutions through the controlled manipulation of model structure. SVMs are well-suited in the sense that manipulation of a few free parameters can dramatically alter the geometry of decision boundaries [50]. Pasolli et al. [28] previously implemented a multi-objective method for SVR parameter selection. For our species relative abundance problems, parameter selection alone failed to achieve desired reductions in systematic error (Supplementary Table S1). Meaningful reductions required additional complexity in model specification, achieved through the integration of variable and sample selection. Integration of variable selection into GA chromosome design enabled population diversification across a much larger search space, ultimately leading to the evolution of models with substantially reduced bias. Our sample selection mechanism led to further improvements in model performance in some cases, presumably for similar reasons. SVR models are directly determined by individual samples (SVs) lying on or outside margin boundaries. The removal or addition of an SV necessarily changes model fit, whereas removal of a sample lying within the SVR margin does not. We made certain samples eligible for exclusion based on an assumption that they were more likely to be SVs under a variety of model specifications due to observed variability in land cover or image characteristics. Enabling their exclusion further reduced bias or total error in some but not all cases (Supplementary Table S1).Although MOSVR effectively reduced systematic error, there is room to question when this is necessary. Riemann et al. [17] presented a multi-scale comparison of biomass predictions made by a GNN variant against FIA plot measurements as a means of assessing model bias. A comparison of plot measurements and pixel-level predictions (250 m pixels) revealed strong systematic disagreement consistent with attenuation bias, but comparisons of averages across large spatial scales (78,100 and 216,500 ha) revealed low levels of systematic disagreement. Riemann et al. [17] interpreted this as evidence of an unbiased model, and specifically that systematic differences between plots and pixels were more attributable to validation data uncertainty than actual model error. However, attenuation bias does not degrade mean predictive accuracy and averages over large areas should be little affected. It seems plausible that large-area averages could agree well, despite substantial attenuation bias in the modeled plot-pixel relationships and substantial systematic error at the plot-pixel level. Riemann et al. [17] stated that strong systematic agreement of large-area averages provides evidence of an unbiased model under the unverified assumption that modeled relationships apply across scales. But modeled relationships could generally be expected to differ across scales of aggregation (i.e., the modifiable areal unit problem [63]). These considerations leave open the alternative interpretation that the GNN model was biased.The question of whether systematic disagreement between plots and pixels should be considered evidence of model bias or a validation artifact has been explored in relation to predictor variable uncertainty. Xu et al. [7] examined the effects of predictor variable uncertainty in the context of ordinary linear regression. Using a field measurement protocol specifically designed to investigate the effects of mismatches in scale and location between plots and pixels, they compared prediction patterns against those expected from two types of predictor variable uncertainty. When the observed predictor W is a noisy realization of the true or ideal predictor X (W = X + U, where the error term U has zero mean and is independent of X such that E(W|X) = X), the Classical error model applies. This corresponds to the situation in which plots are larger than pixels, or a species responds to a long-term average but the corresponding predictor variable reflects a shorter time frame (as would be the case for our mid-month insolation predictors, for example). When the observed predictor is considered a smooth representation of the true or ideal predictor (X = W + U and E(X|W) = W), the Berkson error model applies. This corresponds to the situation in which plots are smaller than pixels, or a species responds to environmental conditions over a shorter timeframe than predictors represent (as may be the case when species are affected by extreme conditions that are not resolved by climatological predictors). Xu et al. [7] demonstrated that although Berkson error does cause apparent systematic error in cross-validation outcomes, that pattern is no longer present when predictions are compared to new reference observations made at the same scale. Linear models are not biased by Berkson error. In contrast, Classical error does cause strong attenuation bias of the model itself, affecting coefficients and introducing systematic error that does not go away when validation data are scaled to match pixels.The Berkson model fits the situation in which moderate resolution predictors are paired with FIA plots, and the work of Xu et al. [7] would appear to validate the assertions of Riemann et al. [17] on those grounds. However, several factors virtually ensure that actual predictor error deviates from the Berkson model. Location mismatches caused by georeferencing or GPS error, for example, are best represented by a mixture of Classical and Berkson error and can cause attenuation bias more severe than Classical error associated with a scale mismatch [7]. Additionally, many applications build models using predictors with different patterns of uncertainty, some of which may be best represented by Berkson error and some by Classical error. For species distribution models that utilize environmental variables, the nature of predictor uncertainty may differ by species due to different responses to environmental conditions (e.g., differing sensitivity to extreme vs. average conditions). Finally, the analysis provided by Xu et al. [7] was based on ordinary linear regression. Both Berkson and Classical error can cause attenuation bias and systematic prediction error when models are nonlinear or nonparametric [64]. Not all systematic error in plot-pixel comparisons is indicative of model bias, but without a thorough accounting of predictor uncertainty and its impact on predictions in a specific modeling framework, it may be best to assume that some level of bias is present and some level of correction is warranted.The ultimate impact of attenuation bias on map use will presumably depend on map- and application-specific factors. Attenuation does not degrade mean predictive accuracy, but bias can dramatically affect spatial prediction patterns, particularly at the high end of observed values. Balsam fir (species ABBA) provides a convenient illustration. MOSVR and SOSVR models explained nearly identical amounts of variation in observed values, but MOSVR predictions had less systematic error and SOSVR predictions had less scatter and lower total error (Figure 5; Figure 6). Spatial patterns of predicted relative abundance were notably different at landscape scales (Figure 9).Whereas MOSVR predicted values up to 100%, SOSVR predictions infrequently exceeded 75%. The stronger attenuation bias of SOSVR generally suppressed local variability and produced a more uniform pattern of relative abundance than expected. MOSVR reduced attenuation bias, producing more realistic spatial patterns including patches of high relative abundance. These differences are important. Balsam fir is the primary host of the eastern spruce budworm (ESBW; Choristoneura fumiferana Clem.), a native insect that can cause widespread mortality of fir and spruce trees during cyclic outbreaks [65]. Vulnerability to ESBW defoliation is in large part determined by balsam fir relative abundance, with the greatest impact anticipated to occur in mature spruce-fir stands with fir relative abundance exceeding 75% [66]. Systematic under-estimation of vulnerability will ultimately cause underestimation of budworm impact. Additionally, because ESBW outbreak dynamics appear to be influenced by spatial distributions of host- and non-host-dominant stands [67,68], accurate predictions of tree species dominance and codominance should be important as well.Finally, use of MOSVR presents certain challenges. Although the MATLAB implementation of NSGA-II provides an option for parallel execution, in our case the total execution time required for each species model ranged from 17–76 h, and averaged 46 h (using the MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox with 12 workers, one worker per physical CPU core, and a 3.40 GHz CPU). However, we did not systematically explore strategies to reduce execution time. Additionally, we recognize that outlier removal is a weakness of our current implementation. Further development is warranted, and we are investigating robust measures of systematic error as an alternative to outlier removal. Use of a GA for model training bears certain implications for model interpretation, particularly in a multi-objective framework. Similar performance characteristics may be achieved with different model specifications. Consequently, models lying near to one another on the Pareto front may show substantive differences in SVR parameters or variable/sample selections. MOSVR relative abundance models included on average 21 of 94 variables and excluded on average 24 samples from model training (Supplementary Table S2). For nearly all species, models included both spectral, terrain, and climatological variables. We caution against over-interpretation of variable selections and sample exclusions at this point, however, as GAs provide a group selection mechanism. Additional steps could be taken to evaluate the relative importance of variables. Post-hoc analyses of response and predictor variable values could be used to illuminate important relationships between variables (e.g., [69]). Inspection of variable selection and variable importance patterns across the Pareto front may provide insight into how certain variables influence attenuation. Similarly, further analysis of excluded samples might improve our understanding of whether and how certain plot or image conditions are more likely to affect levels of systematic error. This would require extensive analysis, however, since SVM model fit is determined by a subset of samples (SVs), and the selection or exclusion of a sample may or may not affect model fit under different parameter settings. All of these issues warrant further work.", 4. Discussion,None,4
307,"Patterns of error observed in predictions of tree species relative abundance were consistent with strong attenuation bias caused by uncertainty in remote sensing and geospatial predictor data. Comparing results across different predictive models, systematic error as a fraction of total error was typically greatest in regression models that achieved the lowest total error. Pronounced underestimation at high relative abundance caused large deviations between predicted and observed patterns of species dominance and codominance. As expected, nearest neighbor methods produced better agreement with observed dominance/codominance by preserving observed species associations. Yet predictive accuracy was low and attenuation bias was high for individual species. Our multi-objective support vector regression (MOSVR) approach effectively reduced systematic error for all species while maintaining comparatively low total error, and improved predicted patterns of dominance/codominance to a level approaching that of the nearest neighbor methods.Others have made compelling arguments that physical differences in scale and location between pixels and field plots are primary contributors to attenuation bias [7,8], and some have suggested that the use of FIA or similar forest inventory data for model training may be ill-advised [7,13]. Yet FIA data is often used to train predictive models, and although error patterns at the scale of predictions are not always reported (e.g., [5,70]), results are probably subject to some level of attenuation bias. Not all systematic error is indicative of model bias, but lacking detailed knowledge of predictor uncertainty and its impact in specific modeling frameworks, some level of correction is likely to be warranted. In that case, MOSVR can provide an effective machine learning approach to the reduction of systematic prediction error.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
308,"In forest monitoring, the diameter at breast height (DBH) is the diameter of a cross-section of a tree trunk 1.3 m above the ground. The DBH is an important factor used to estimate important forestry indices like forest growing stock, basal area, biomass, and carbon stock. The traditional DBH ground surveys effectively provide objective and reliable monitoring and managing information for forest resources [1,2,3,4], but they are time-consuming, labor-intensive, expensive, and hard to implement, particularly in mountainous and forest areas [4].The establishment of DBH prediction models has mainly been based on stand growth models. Three kinds of models are frequently used: Empirical models, process models, and hybrid models [5]. Empirical models require some biological factors such as tree height, age, and crown width as independent variable sets, and introduce some regression estimation methods, such as curve, Gompertz, Schumacher, or Richards models, in estimating DBH [6,7,8,9,10]. Although their construction is intuitive and simple, the variability of the empirical relationship between the dependent and independent variables means the empirical models are less adaptable. By introducing physiological and ecological factors, such as climate, precipitation, and soil, the process models improve the ability to simulate stand growth [11]. The inclusion of many physiological and ecological factors produces highly complex and inflexible process models, which leads to difficulties in meeting the actual requirements. In combining empirical models and process models, hybrid models—which include the linear mixed effect model and the nonlinear mixed effect model—have better estimation accuracy and adaptability. However, the combination further increases the complexity and flexibility of the models.Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be effectively used to solve nonlinear problems [12], such as the prediction of forest growth. To find more effective methods for forest growth estimation, many experts and scholars have introduced ANN models into the field of forestry for the dynamic monitoring of forest resources and the simulation of forest growth process [13,14,15]. Compared with traditional stand growth models, the backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) model provides the best prediction effect to fit and analyze the growth of tree DBH [16,17,18].Compared with the BP-NN model, the generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model has the advantages of a simpler structure, fewer parameters, a faster prediction speed, and less computational complexity [19]. Correspondingly, some scholars have used the GRNN model to estimate forest parameters [20,21].Scholars have found that DBH is strongly affected by environmental factors, such as topography, soil, and climate [22,23,24,25,26,27]. Pach et al. showed that at fertile mountain sites and highland forest sites, fir trees reached the highest growing stock [23]. Li et al. showed that the DBH growth of natural Korean pine forest is affected by topographic factors, particularly the elevation and slope direction [24]. Ou et al. found that DBH growth is correlated with the slope direction, soil hydrolytic nitrogen, dominant tree height, average tree height, and tree density [25]. Yu et al. and Wang et al. found that temperature and precipitation affect the DBH growth of larch, spruce, fir, and Tianshan spruce [26,27].The increasing resolution of remote sensing images has provided additional benefits for forest monitoring. Zarco-Tejada et al. showed that the tree height can be obtained by three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images [28]. Ibanez et al. reported that various forest parameters, with the exception of DBH, can be directly obtained using light detection and ranging (LIDAR) images according to the point cloud characteristics at different forest levels [29]. Using field data and vegetation index (VI) data derived from Systeme Probatoire d’Observation de la Terre 5 (SPOT-5) satellite images, Muhd-Ekhzarizal et al. used some simple and multilinear regression methods to estimate the aboveground biomass in mangrove forests [30]. Chrysafis et al. found a strong correlation between the growing stock volume and three indices derived from Sentinel-2 images, i.e., the difference vegetation index (DVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and perpendicular vegetation index (PVI) [31]. Using ALOS-PALSAR L-band full-polarization data, Chowdhury et al. estimated the forest growing stock volume (GSV) and showed that the GSV at forest stand level in Siberia could be quantified with reasonable accuracy, and that temporal variations of GSV could be better tracked [2]. Vegetation indices (VIs) reflect the dynamic changes of forests to some extent and are helpful in predicting forest parameters. For example, Mou et al. indicated that the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is most sensitive to changes in the canopy leaf area index and Laurin et al. added NDVI values to aboveground biomass estimations to obtain better results [32,33]. Han et al. showed that the vegetation indices from different remote sensing data sources have different separability from ground objects [34]. Reyadh et al. found that a similar variability in the average derived NDVI from different remote sensing data sources, but the average derived NDVI values were different [35]. Buheaosier showed that the range of NDVIs is related to the spatial resolution of remote sensing data sources [36]. However, limited by a lack of human power, high costs, weak endurance capability, and a small communication range, UAV remote sensing and radar remote sensing are still difficult to apply to large-scale forest monitoring [37,38]. Furthermore, airborne imagery is easily affected by wind power and terrain, and is vulnerable to air traffic control [39]. In China, especially in the south regions, the weather is usually changeable, and the terrain is usually complex, hence airborne imageries are still difficult to be applied in large-scale forest monitoring. Therefore, satellite remote sensing images remain the main supplementary data resource for dynamic monitoring of large-scale forest resources in China.During the estimation or prediction of DBH at the forest stand level, the data from the permanent plots (the basic units of national forest inventory) are frequently chosen to validate the various models [40,41]. However, in China, the number of subcompartments is much larger than the number of permanent plots. To reduce the cost of investigating, the estimation of DBH based on subcompartments is more valuable than the methods based on permanent forest plots.This study focused on the prediction of DBH at the subcompartment’s level in Longquan city. The specific purposes of this paper are to: (1) Ascertain the suitable ecological factors, biological factors and remote sensing factors which have great impact on DBH with a relatively low cost for data-acquisition; (2) explore a more accurate and more generalizable model to predict DBH. The specific steps of this study are as follows: First, using tree age as the only independent variable, 13 kinds of empirical models were established to fit the relationship between the tree age and the DBH of forest subcompartments and predict DBH growth. Second, the independent variables were extended to 19 parameters, including 8 ecological and biological factors (elevation, slope, aspect, soil depth, humus thickness, age of tree, canopy density, and number of stems per hectare), and 11 remote sensing factors (bands 2–7 (B2–B7) from the operational land imager (OLI) sensor of the Landsat-8 satellite, NDVI, ratio vegetation index (RVI), DVI, EVI, and red index (RI)). The correlation analysis method was introduced to reduce the dimensions of the independent variables separately for either the set of ecological and biological factors or the set of remote sensing factors. Lastly, the remaining independent variables were adopted for modeling and prediction of DBH of the forest subcompartments using a multivariate linear regression (MLR) model and GRNN model.", 1.

Due to its location in a central subtropical monsoon climate zone, the city is warm and humid with abundant rainfall. Longquan is the largest forested city in Zhejiang province, with 265,667 ha of forest resources, 14.56 million cubic meters of forest growing stock, and a forest coverage of 84.2% [42].", 2.

310,"The research data included the inventory data for forest management planning and design, the digital elevation model (DEM), and remote sensing images from Landsat-8 Thematic Mapper (TM). The 2017 inventory data were supplied by the Forestry Bureau of Longquan. The TM and DEM data were both derived from the Geospatial Data Cloud [43].Six factors were derived from the inventory data for forest management planning and design, including DBH, soil depth, humus thickness, canopy density, number of stems per hectare, and age of tree. Three factors, elevation, slope, and aspect, were obtained from DEM and 11 factors were derived from the remote sensing images, including B2–B7, NDVI, RVI, DVI, EVI, and RI.The inventory data, containing 58,910 records of forest subcompartments, were obtained from the Forestry Bureau of Longquan in 2017. According to the rules for the technical operation of the inventory for forest management planning and design in Zhejiang province (2014) [44], the original inventory data acquisition procedure is as follows: Within the scope of the subcompartments, some standard plots or angle gauge plots are laid out using random, mechanical, or other sampling methods, and the corresponding forest factors are measured in the plots by professionals, and the subcompartment factors are then calculated. Therefore, whether modeling or predicting, all the data—including DBH, soil depth, humus thickness, canopy density, number of stems per hectare, and age of tree—are presented as an average value at the forest subcompartment level. The unsuitable data were removed via preliminary processing, including records for zero-volume subcompartments which were located in non-forest plots, or those with subcompartment DBHs less than 5 cm, which do not meet the standard for measurement [44]. Therefore, the final inventory data included 35,763 records of forest subcompartments. These were randomly separated into two groups, with one containing 25,000 records for modeling, and the remaining 10,763 records used as testing data for prediction (Table 1).The DEM data were originally obtained from the first version data of the global DEM (GDEM) generated by the advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer, including four images in 2009, with 30 m resolution, IMG data type, World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84), and the universal transverse mercator (UTM) projection. The data were obtained from the International Scientific and Technical Data Mirror Site, Computer Network Information Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences [43].The remote sensing images, which correspond fully with the timeline of the inventory data, were generated by Landsat-8 TM from Landsat satellites in 2017. There are two sensors in each Landsat satellite that collect data from discrete portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, known as bands, according to their wavelength. The Landsat-8 satellite’s images, with the UTM/WGS 84 coordinate system, include 11 bands representing portions of the electromagnetic spectrum, consisting of visible bands and invisible bands to the human eye. Here, the visible bands include 5 bands, i.e., band 1, called the coastal band, with wavelengths of 0.433–0.453 μm; band 2, called the blue band, with wavelengths of 0.450–0.515 μm; band 3, called the green band, with wavelengths of 0.525–0.600 μm; band 4, called the red band, with wavelengths of 0.630–0.680 μm; and band 8, called the pan band, with wavelengths of 0.500–0.680 μm. The invisible bands include 6 bands, i.e., band 5, called the near infrared (NIR) band, with wavelengths from 0.845 to 0.885 μm; band 6, called the SWIR-1 band, with wavelengths of 1.560–1.660 μm; band 7, called the SWIR-2 band, with wavelengths of 2.100–2.300 μm; band 9, called the cirrus band, with wavelengths of 1.360–1.390 μm; band 10, called the TIRS-1 band, with wavelengths of 10.6–11.2 μm; and band 11, called the TIRS-2 band, with wavelengths of 11.5–12.5 μm. The spatial resolution of the bands is mostly 30 m except for band 8, which contains panchromatic data with a resolution of 15 m, and bands 10 and 11 provide data collected at a 100 m resolution.", 2.

In ArcGIS 10.2 (Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA, USA), the DEM data and remote sensing data were extracted based on each subcompartment.

312,"The traditional models used to predict DBH of the forest subcompartment are usually based on the relationship between DBH and the independent variables of tree age, height, and crown width. However, the costs of data-acquisition of the height and crown width of the trees are quite high in practical measurement. In contrast, the tree-age of the subcompartment refers to the average tree-age of the dominant species which is usually stable in a relative short period. In this way, as long as the initial values of the tree age are obtained successfully, only 1 needs to be added for each year after the measurement. Thus, the cost of data-acquisition is relatively low. Therefore, the 13 empirical models based on the age–DBH model that use tree age as the only independent variable [45,46,47,48] were selected to predict DBH in this paper (Table 2).", 3. Methods, 3.2.

313,"The nonparametric test is an important part of statistical analysis methods that is used to infer the population distribution using the sample data in situations where the total variance is unknown or uncertain. As the total variance in advance was unable to be estimated, the nonparametric test was preferable for inferring the population distribution. The Spearman rank correlation analysis is a specific method used to implement the nonparametric test to estimate the correlation between two variables. Here, the observed values of two variables needed to be paired with the graded data originally or converted from the observed data of the continuous variables without considering the overall distribution pattern and sample size of the two variables. The formula for calculating the correlation coefficient of the Spearman rank is shown in Equation (1), and the calculation is based on the rank of the value, rather than the value itself. The calculation was conducted in SPSS 20 (International Business Machines Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) using the double tail test.

The various MLR selection methods include the forward, backward, stepwise, entering, and deletion methods. This study chose the stepwise method, also called the stepwise regression model, to filter the independent variables to feed to the MLR model, which is represented in Equation (3).

315,"The generalized regression neural network (GRNN) was first proposed by Specht in 1991 [50]. On the basis of the estimation of a probability distribution function, the GRNN can solve nonlinear approximative problems. The GRNN gradually converges to the optimal regression surface as the number of training samples increases. The advantages of the GRNN include its simplicity and high accuracy in modeling and prediction. The GRNN architecture includes four layers (Figure 2): Input, hidden, summation, and output [51].In the input layer, the amount of neurons is determined by the number of the input variables, and each neuron represents an input variable. The input layer does not process the signal but nonlinearly transmits the signal to the hidden layer.In the hidden layer, the neurons accept the information from the input layer and express the relationship (Pi) between the input layer and hidden layer with a pattern of radial basic function as the activation function. The radial basic function is usually represented by the Gaussian function:

317,"The data from 25,000 samples were fed to the 13 empirical models. The results are illustrated in Table 3.The modeling results of the 13 empirical models showed that the R2 values were between 0.438 and 0.592. The F-test was performed for the first 13 models, showing that the p-values (0.000) were less than 0.01. This indicates a very high level of significance for the models.Subsequently, the tree age data from the remaining 10,763 samples were fed to the above 13 empirical models to predict DBHs of the forest subcompartments. The results are illustrated in Table 4 and Figure 3. The MAPEs ranged from 15.63 to 19.30%, which means that the accuracies of the prediction were above 80%. Compared to the modeling results, the fluctuation in R2 obviously increased with a range of 0.2492–0.5092 in the prediction results. Even if the four models (linear, compound curve, growth curve, and exponential curve) produced the same R2 of 0.455 in modeling, the prediction ability of the linear model, with an R2 of 0.4374, was obviously better than the curve models (compound, growth curve, and exponential curve) with an R2 of 0.2492. The Gompertz model provided the strongest generalizability with the best R2 of 0.5092, even if the modeling R2 was only 0.496.", 4. Results, 4.1. Modeling and Prediction Based on Empirical Models,4
318,"The significance level was used to compute the confidence level with a value between 0 and 1, usually denoted by symbol p. Due to the rule that the lower the significance level, the higher the confidence level, and the lower the probability of making mistakes, choosing an appropriate significance level is necessary to guarantee the proper credibility level. A two-tailed test was used to compute the significance level (p) here, and the correlation analysis was involved in the calculation of the correlation coefficient (r).Since forest growth is affected by many environmental factors, such as topography and soil [52,53], the DBH of trees of the same age may vary considerably in different environments. From the inventory data for forest management planning and design and DEM, this study initially chose eight influencing factors—elevation, slope, slope aspect, thickness of soil layer, humus thickness, age of tree, canopy density, and number of trees per hectare—to analyze the correlation coefficients [54,55,56]. The results (Table 5) show that the six factors (elevation, slope aspect, humus thickness, age of tree, canopy density, and number of trees per hectare) reached a very significant level (p ≤ 0.01), with a relatively large correlation coefficient (r ≥ 0.1) for four factors, namely, the elevation, age of the tree, canopy density, and the number of trees per hectare, which were included in further modeling and prediction by MLR and GRNN.From the remote sensing images and based on previous research, 11 influencing factors were chosen, including bands 2–7, NDVI, RVI, DVI, EVI, and RI, as the primitive factors.After the correlation analysis, the results (Table 6) showed that except for RI, the remaining 10 factors reached a very significant level (p ≤ 0.01), and the correlation coefficient was relatively large (r ≥ 0.1) in the seven factors of bands 2–7 and DVI, which were included in further modeling and prediction by MLR and GRNN.", 4.

321,"Based on the research data that were divided into 25,000 training samples and 10,763 testing samples (Table 1), the 13 empirical age–DBH models (Table 2), in which the only independent variable was the tree age, were used to fit the relationship between the tree age and DBH of the forest subcompartments (Table 3) and to predict the DBH (Table 4). The modeling results of the 13 empirical models had R2 values between 0.438 and 0.592. The MAPEs ranged from 15.63 to 19.3%, which means that the accuracies of the predictions were above 80%. The amplitude of R2 prediction results obviously increased with a range of 0.2492–0.5092 compared to the modeling results. However, the Gompertz model provided the strongest generalizability with the best performance metrics of 1.7622 cm in MAE, 15.63% in MAPE, and 0.5092 in R2, which were even better than the modeling result. These findings are similar to those reported by Xu et al. and Lin et al. [57,58]. With the various size classes of DBH, Xu et al., taking 90 felled maple trees (Liquidambar formosana Hance) as the study object, and Lin et al., taking 90 felled Schima superba trees (Schima superba Gardn. et Champ.) as the study object, found that Gompertz was the optimal model, whether for DBH, tree height, or volume [57,58].After the correlation analysis, the four factors from the inventory data for forest management planning and design and DEM were retained for further modeling and prediction by MLR and GRNN, namely, the elevation, age of the tree, canopy density, and the number of trees per hectare, as these satisfied p ≤ 0.01 and r ≥ 0.1. The order of absolute values of the correlation coefficients from high to low was the age of the tree, canopy density, the number of trees per hectare, and elevation. The R for the relationship between the number of trees per hectare and the DBH was negative, which indicated that competition among the trees affected the growth in DBH. This finding is similar to those reported by Luo et al. [53], with a negative correlation between the number of trees per hectare and DBH, and similar to Escalante et al. [54], in which forest stand simulations under fixed conditions indicated that the probabilities of diameter growth increase with site productivity increase, and decrease with an increase in the stand density index.From the remote sensing images, the seven factors of bands 2–7 and DVI were also retained. The order of the absolute values of the correlation coefficients from high to low was B3, B2, B5, DVI, B6, B4, and B7.The prediction results obtained by MLR and GRNN (Table 7) when using more environmental factors, such as topography and soil, were much better than those produced by the 13 empirical age–DBH models. This indicates that the environmental factors are beneficial for the estimation of DBH.By adding the remote sensing image factors, the experimental results from MLR were further improved from 1.6006 cm in MAE, 14.96% in MAPE, 2.0707 cm in RMSE, 0.6193 in R2, and 0.0854 in TIC to 1.5300 cm in MAE, 14.38% in MAPE, 1.9976 cm in RMSE, 0.6459 in R2, and 0.0823 in TIC. Correspondingly, the experimental results from GRNN were improved from 1.4926 cm in MAE, 13.99% in MAPE, 1.9980 cm in RMSE, 0.6484 in R2, and 0.0826 in TIC to 1.4688 cm in MAE, 13.78% in MAPE, 1.9655 cm in RMSE, 0.6574 in R2, and 0.0810 in TIC. This indicates that the remote sensing image factors are beneficial to the estimation of DBH.Regardless of whether remote sensing image factors were included, the experimental results from GRNN—with lower MAE, MAPE, RMSE, and higher R2—were better than those of MLR. In the forestry application of artificial neural networks (ANNs), He et al. used the ANN method to simulate and predict the DBH for different age groups and showed that the mean predictive accuracy of DBH for bamboo stands was satisfactory [16]. Vieira et al. estimated the growth of DBH and height of eucalyptus trees in 398 plots using artificial intelligence techniques (AIT), including ANN and an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and obtained good accuracy [59]. Although different from previous studies, this study still achieved an acceptable accuracy to predict DBH at the subcompartment’s level with GRNN based on more diversified tree species and a wider range of samples totaling 35,763. Thus, the prediction results are more convincing.", 5. Discussion,None,5
322,"The prediction results by MLR and GRNN when using more environmental factors, such as topography and soil, were much better than those produced using traditional empirical age–DBH models. The use of comprehensive factors, including ecological and biological factors, was beneficial for improving the prediction accuracy of both the MLR and GRNN models. When remote sensing factors were included, the performance metrics were further improved in the MLR and GRNN models, with MAE decreasing by 0.0238 and 0.0706 cm, MAPE decreasing by 0.21% and 0.58%, RMSE decreasing by 0.0325 and 0.0731 cm, R2 increasing by 0.09 and 0.0266, TIC decreasing by 0.0031 and 0.0016, respectively. Regardless of whether remote sensing image factors were included, the experimental results produced using GRNN were better than those using MLR. For modeling and prediction based on more complex tree species and a wider range of samples, the GRNN model is more desirable due to its stronger generalizability.", 6. Conclusions,None,6
323,"Biomass is an important biophysical parameter used to understand carbon dynamics on the background of global climate change, and the spatiotemporal estimation of biomass will provide invaluable information for carbon calculation and scientific forest management [1,2]. In the past few decades, remote sensing has been increasingly used to estimate aboveground biomass because of its macroscopical, nondestructive, and efficiency advantages compared to time- and space-limited field survey methods [3,4]. Historically, the field-measured biomass has been usually calculated by establishing species-specific allometric equations based on height and diameter at breast height (DBH) gauged within standardized plots, which provide the basic samples for remote sensing-based biomass simulation [5,6]. Spatiotemporal biomass retrieval based on remote sensing has been increasingly implemented, because when compared to single-period biomass distribution, it provides more details for biomass change detection and further exploration of the influencing mechanisms [7]. Among various remote sensing data sources, Landsat imagery has acquired wide applications in biomass estimation due to its open-access data availability, appropriate spatial resolution, and abundant history archive [3,8]. Multiple potential features can be derived from the existing Landsat imagery, including multispectral bands, vegetation indices, texture bands, and time-sequence data, which provide abundant information for biomass retrieval [9,10,11].Statistical methods and radiative transfer models are two common methods used to quantify biomass spatial distributions [12,13]. Radiative transfer models usually describe mechanisms using combinations of complicated parameters, which makes the process difficult to implement. Comparatively speaking, statistical methods realize this prediction processes by establishing relationships more directly. Among the most advanced approaches, machine learning methods have received considerable attention in recent years [14,15]. Compared to traditional regression algorithms such as multiple linear regression, machine learning algorithms have no strict assumptions on input variables or relationships between response variables and explanatory variables [16]. Support vector machine, random forest, and k-nearest neighbor are the most often implemented algorithms that result in satisfactory prediction [17,18,19]. Random forest (RF) is frequently selected as the regression method for biomass retrieval because of its outstanding performance, for example with higher prediction accuracy [20,21]. The difference between RF and other state-of-the art machine learning methods is that RF requires fewer parameters, but provides more accurate predictions [22]. Varied natural environments and human activities greatly influence changes in AGB (aboveground biomass). In the anthropogenic era, forest management has a profound impact on forest ecosystem dynamics. China’s Natural Forest Conservation Program has increased the total biomass in China by persistent afforestation and reforestation [7]. At the same time, the influence of natural conditions on biomass change has also been investigated. Sattler et al. found that biomass could get different accumulations in sloped and flat regions after afforestation [23]. However, Lee et al. stated that there were no significant relationships between biomass and topographical factors in that intact lowland forest [24]. Therefore, the biomass distribution and change influenced by topography should be further explored. Although Du et al. pointed out that the biomass spatial distribution in Zhejiang Province was related to topographical factors including altitude and slope [25], biomass heterogeneity caused by topography across different districts has not been investigated, especially when combined with remote sensing techniques. The impact of hierarchical elevation and ecological forests on biomass spatiotemporal change has been explored previously [9]. In this study, the objectives are: (1) based on the field measurements in 2010 and 2015, to map the distribution of aboveground biomass under different topographic conditions in Zhejiang Province in both years; (2) to inspect further topographical factors including slope and aspect on AGB and its change; and (3) to reveal the regular pattern within different regions under discrepant natural environment and human conditions. The flowchart of this research was displayed in Figure 1.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
324,"Zhejiang Province is located in the southeastern region of China, ranging from 118°02′ E–123°08′ E, 27°03′ N–31°11′ N, with a subtropical monsoon climate. The annual average temperature is between 15 and 18 °C and the annual precipitation is between 1100 and 2000 mm. Being one of the most developed provinces with regard to the economy in China, it has consumed a large number of wood resources in the past several decades, and now, a majority of the land is covered with secondary forests. The local government has made great efforts to protect forests. As a result, the total forest coverage in the province has reached 60.91%. To investigate the influence of different topographic factors on AGB and its change, three counties named Wuyi County (administered by Jinhua City), Xianju County (belonging to Taizhou City), and Dinghai District (governed by Zhoushan City) were selected as the study areas (Figure 2). They are representative of basin, mountain, and island regions, which are located in the middle, southeast, and northeast of Zhejiang Province, respectively. ", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area,2
325,"Field investigations were carried out in 2010 and 2015 by Zhejiang Academy of Forestry. Sample plot design and selection were completed by taking into account the local geographical environment factors across the whole province. The size of each plot was 20 m × 20 m for trees, with three 2 m × 2 m subplots set in the diagonal line of each plot for shrubs and grasses [14]. The total biomass in each plot was calculated by summing the biomass of all trees, shrubs, and herbs, which was further defined as the final aboveground biomass (AGB) with a unit of Mg/ha. AGB values of broadleaved forests, coniferous, and broadleaved mixed forests, shrubs, bamboo forests, pine forests, and Chinese fir forests were calculated using measured DBH and height values embedded in specific allometric equations developed by Yuan et al. [26]. Quadrats outside the forest region and administrative boundary were deleted after checking their positions on remote sensing images and Google Earth based on visual interpretation. The outliers were selected and removed using the Pauta method, also named 3σ (standard deviation) measurement, by calculating the mean and variance values [20]. The statistics of the final dataset for subsequent analysis are shown in Table 1.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Field-Measured Data,2
326,"Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images (L1T) were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) website [27]. Compared to the selected multispectral bands with a spatial resolution of 30 m, the thermal infrared channels for TM (120 m) and OLI (100 m) were abandoned for their coarser resolution. The first blue band (0.43–0.45 μm) of Landsat 8 OLI was removed to keep the bands consistent with Landsat 5 TM. The dates of the acquired images were almost in the same season by considering the phenology. Nevertheless, limited by the availability of cloudless images, the selections were based on the hypothesis that there was no significant biomass difference between imagery acquisition and field investigation. Detailed information about the Landsat images is listed in Table 2.Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data were acquired from the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) V2 product with a spatial resolution of 30 m. Based on the DEM data, elevation, slope, and aspect were generated as the three basic geomorphology features. Administrative boundaries, present land use maps, forest maps, Google earth images, and socioeconomic statistics were collected as additional datasets.To reduce the impact of the atmosphere, radiometric calibration was completed by inputting gain and offset information from the attached files, and an atmospheric correction using fast line of sight atmospheric analysis of spectral hypercubes (FLAASH) was executed. C correction was adopted as the topographic correction method to reduce the impact of terrain effects, especially for regions with shady slopes.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Remote Sensing Data,2
327," 2.4.1. Feature DerivationConsequently, the pixels containing corresponding sample plots were selected to link the spectral information of Landsat imagery with the biomass density of quadrats based on the hypothesis that there should be no significant difference between the biomass per area in the 20 m × 20 m field plots and their position-homologous 30 m × 30 m Landsat pixels. Candidate predictor variables were extracted from the remote sensing imagery specific to previous studies, including multispectral bands, vegetation indices, and texture information. The corrected Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIc), incorporating shortwave infrared bands (SWIR), was calculated [28]. Three components, including brightness, greenness, and wetness, were also derived through the tasseled cap (TC) transformation [29]. Texture variables were also extracted using the gray-level co-occurrence (GLCM) method. 2.4.2. Machine Learning MethodBiomass data selected from field plots were considered as the response variable, and derivatives from remote sensing imagery were treated as predictive variables. Random forest was selected as the prediction method to establish the relationship between AGB and derivatives because numerous researchers have testified to this algorithm’s outstanding performance in biomass estimation [5,20,30]. The algorithm randomly selects variables at each node in the regression and classification tree and uses the bootstrap method to construct training samples without pruning. During this process, 2/3 samples are usually selected as training data, and the others are treated as validation data, which is also called “out-of-bag” [22]. The random selection of samples and variables makes the prediction results variable, but efficient. There are two important parameters, named mtry and ntree, that should be adjusted during the modeling process [31]. ntree controls the number of trees and is usually set to 500, while mtry determines the number of features and is usually set to 1/3 of the total number of input features. In addition, random forest is capable of estimating the relative importance of input features, which can be indicated by two built-in indices named %IncMSE and IncNodePurity. %IncMSE refers to Mean Decrease Accuracy and is calculated by constructing each tree of an ensemble with and without the specific variable. For all trees, the differences in error of these two variants are recorded, averaged, and normalized by their standard deviation [32,33]. It has been used in many previous studies [22] and was adopted in the current study.  2.4.3. Precision EvaluationTen-fold cross-validation was selected as the accuracy assessment approach. It divided the dataset into 10 groups. Once one of the groups was selected as the validation set, the other groups were treated as the training set each time. The process was repeated 10 times until all the groups had been traversed. Random forest modeling and accuracy assessment were implemented in the R 3.5.1 © open source software through the “caret” package [34]. R2 values indicating the variance in the response variable explained by the predictor variables were computed to evaluate modeling accuracy.

Candidate predictor variables were extracted from the remote sensing imagery specific to previous studies, including multispectral bands, vegetation indices, and texture information. The corrected Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVIc), incorporating shortwave infrared bands (SWIR), was calculated [28]. Three components, including brightness, greenness, and wetness, were also derived through the tasseled cap (TC) transformation [29]. Texture variables were also extracted using the gray-level co-occurrence (GLCM) method.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4.1. Feature Derivation,2
329,"Biomass data selected from field plots were considered as the response variable, and derivatives from remote sensing imagery were treated as predictive variables. Random forest was selected as the prediction method to establish the relationship between AGB and derivatives because numerous researchers have testified to this algorithm’s outstanding performance in biomass estimation [5,20,30]. The algorithm randomly selects variables at each node in the regression and classification tree and uses the bootstrap method to construct training samples without pruning. During this process, 2/3 samples are usually selected as training data, and the others are treated as validation data, which is also called “out-of-bag” [22]. The random selection of samples and variables makes the prediction results variable, but efficient. There are two important parameters, named mtry and ntree, that should be adjusted during the modeling process [31]. ntree controls the number of trees and is usually set to 500, while mtry determines the number of features and is usually set to 1/3 of the total number of input features. In addition, random forest is capable of estimating the relative importance of input features, which can be indicated by two built-in indices named %IncMSE and IncNodePurity. %IncMSE refers to Mean Decrease Accuracy and is calculated by constructing each tree of an ensemble with and without the specific variable. For all trees, the differences in error of these two variants are recorded, averaged, and normalized by their standard deviation [32,33]. It has been used in many previous studies [22] and was adopted in the current study. ", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4.2. Machine Learning Method,2
330,"Ten-fold cross-validation was selected as the accuracy assessment approach. It divided the dataset into 10 groups. Once one of the groups was selected as the validation set, the other groups were treated as the training set each time. The process was repeated 10 times until all the groups had been traversed. Random forest modeling and accuracy assessment were implemented in the R 3.5.1 © open source software through the “caret” package [34]. R2 values indicating the variance in the response variable explained by the predictor variables were computed to evaluate modeling accuracy. Furthermore, scatter diagrams of predicted and field-measured biomass values were plotted.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4.3. Precision Evaluation,2
331,"To improve the accuracy of identification, a hierarchical system with six categories (0–30, 30–60, 60–90, 90–120, 120–150, >150 Mg/ha) used in Zhao et al.’s study was applied to the estimated AGB maps in all regions [6]. Simultaneously, topographic variables including elevation, slope, and aspect were classified into different levels by referring to Du et al.’s work [25]. Elevation was reclassified with an interval of 200 m for Wuyi and Xianju. Considering the relative lower elevation in Dinghai District, an interval of 50 m was set by consulting the work of Pan et al. [35]. In terms of slope and aspect, six grades of slope (0–5°, 5–15°, 15–25°, 25–35°, 35–45°, and >45°) and eight categories of aspect (north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest) were adopted to investigate the influence of slope and aspect on AGB distribution and its change. Meanwhile, mean values for each category were calculated from the estimated AGB maps for comparison. Besides, regression methods were used to check whether there was significant correlation between AGB/change and corresponding topography variables.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. AGB Mapping and Spatio-Temporal Characteristic Analysis,2
332,"Due to the randomness of the random forest algorithm, all the modeling process had to be repeated 20 times [20,36]. To investigate the performance of different variables involved in biomass estimation, %IncMSE were normalized for more convenient comparison [36], and the top 10 variables participated in the modeling process in three regions were selected to form the rank of the most important variables shown in Figure 3. Among all the selected variables, NDVIc was always selected as the most significant predictor in 2010, but the SWIR band (OLI Band 6) and derivatives from tassel transformation were among the best in 2015.", 3. Results, 3.1. The Importance Rank of Variables,3
333,"All the samples were used to predict the AGB as a previous study had found that using all samples, when compared to a smaller sample size, was propitious to biomass estimation [5]. R2 were calculated to inspect the modeling accuracy (Figure 4). It can be seen that R2 values fluctuated with different magnitudes, where the estimation in 2010 in Wuyi County (blue, solid line) obtained the best performance, while the prediction in Dinghai (green) showed relatively lower accuracy. Besides, Figure 5 shows the scatter plots by using the simple linear regression method for estimated AGB and field measurements. Limited by the total number of samples, Xianju and Dinghai had lower R2 values than Wuyi, but all values of R2 were beyond 0.8. Meanwhile, underestimation of the values of the highest biomass and overestimation on the values of the lowest biomass cannot be ignored.", 3. Results, 3.2. Accuracy Assessment,3
334,"When inspecting the spatial change in different periods, Figure 6 showed that the overall AGB in three regions increased from 2010–2015. AGB values below 30 Mg/ha accounted for a relatively small proportion in all the regions, which were mostly distributed in water areas and construction lands (when compared to the land use map, but not shown here). Simultaneously, AGB values beyond 150 Mg/ha also occupied a low percentage, and AGB in most regions changed in the range of 30–120 Mg/ha. Moreover, AGB in Dinghai District increased evidently, almost covering the whole region.The topographic features in the three regions in Table 3 indicated that Dinghai District, occupying the smallest area, had the lowest mean values of elevation, slope, and aspect, while Xianju County, covering the largest area, owned the highest mean values. Meanwhile, Wuyi and Xianju Counties had higher mean values of AGB than Dinghai District had both in 2010 and 2015. However, the AGB in Xianju County acquired the least increase with the minimum increase rate, and Dinghai had the highest increase rate of AGB. ", 3. Results, 3.3.

335," 3.4.1. AGB Change in Wuyi CountyFigure 7 showed that the relations between AGB/change and terrain features in Wuyi County had different trends. When the elevation became higher, AGB gradually grew until the elevation reached 900 m, then it started to decrease with higher elevation. This situation took place both in 2010 and 2015. Although in general, AGB increased with higher elevation, the magnitude of biomass increase was getting smaller (Figure 7a). In terms of slope (Figure 7b), a higher slope possessed higher biomass values, but a steeper slope made lower AGB increase, especially when the slope was higher than 45°; AGB in 2015 was obviously smaller than that in 2010. As for the aspect, Figure 7c shows that the mean values of AGB were almost similar in both years; even the change during this period in different aspects was almost the same. The radar chart (Figure 7d) provides more information to understand the AGB distribution characteristics for eight aspects, where all the octagons had nearly equal angles. No significant AGB difference could be found for different aspects, which was verified by the regression methods displayed in Table 4. It was also demonstrated that the magnitude of AGB increase had significant negative correlations with elevation and slope. 3.4.2. AGB Change in Xianju CountyThe relation between AGB/change and terrain features in Xianju County is displayed in Figure 8. Figure 8a,b indicates that biomass increased with higher elevation and a steeper slope both in 2010 and 2015, but Figure 8c states that aspect had different relationships with biomass in these two years. Combined with the results in Table 5, AGB and its increase had a positive relation with elevation and slope. Meanwhile, AGB had a significant negative relation with aspect in 2010, but the relationship became insignificant in 2015 (Figure 8c). On the basis of the result in the radar chart (Figure 8d), AGB acquired a higher increase in magnitude in the western aspects.  3.4.3. AGB Change in Dinghai DistrictFrom Figure 9, different relations can be found between AGB/change and three topographic factors. Connecting the results of Figure 9a to Table 6, it can be seen that AGB and its change increased with high elevation, but in 2010 and from 2010–2015, the linear correlations were not significant. When inspecting the slope, AGB generally increased with higher slope in each year, but when the slope became steeper, AGB changed with a lower increase un magnitude, especially when the slope was higher than 50°; AGB in 2015 was smaller than 2010 (Figure 9b). Although Figure 9c revealed that in the south aspect, AGB had the lowest value both in 2010 and 2015, the regression results (Table 6) affirmed that aspect had no significant relations with AGB in two years, and AGB kept at a relatively steady level during this period.  3.4.4. Comparison of AGB/Change in Three RegionsTo investigate the AGB difference between the three terrain regions scientifically, the values of AGB/change were compared under the same assessment system using a unified stratified classification (Figure 10). Figure 10a shows that the mountains in Wuyi County had the highest elevation beyond 1000 m and Dinghai District held the lowest elevation. However, Xianju County always possessed the highest AGB in each subclass with a considerable magnitude of increase. AGB change in Wuyi in the period from 2010–2015 showed a decrease tendency when the elevation was higher, while in the other two regions, AGB obtained the opposite trend. In terms of slope, Xianju stood out for its notably higher AGB in 2015 among all the stratifications. Besides, when the slope became steeper, AGB increased with less magnitude in Wuyi and Dinghai, and it even became a negative number when the slope was larger than 45 degrees. However, the increase of AGB in Xianju kept growing during this period, independent of the change of slope (Figure 10b). As for the aspect, it can be observed from Figure 10c that Wuyi had the highest AGB and Dinghai had the lowest AGB in each aspect, both in 2010 and 2015. Furthermore, three regions all achieved increased AGB in all aspects, with Wuyi having the highest magnitude, but Xianju holding the least growth in each aspect. ", 3. Results, 3.4.

340,"The relative importance of different variables involved in the modeling process is normalized and compared in Figure 3. Among the most important variables in 2015, except for that in Xianju, SWIR (OLI Band 6) held relatively higher score values of %IncMSE, which can be explained by the reason that SWIR is more sensitive to moisture and shade components inherent in the forest stand structure and less impacted by atmospheric conditions [6,37]. Moreover, NDVIc incorporating SWIR acquired better performance in 2010 than it did in 2015 for all regions, which suggested that it would be apt to support the hypothesis that this variable was more suitable for open forest stands [28,38]. The preceding presentation showed that AGB generally increased from 2010–2015, while here, the relative importance of NDVIc descended on the whole. In terms of tasseled cap, its components have been widely used in biomass estimation [14,21,39]. Brightness, greenness, and wetness were successively selected as important predictor variables, similar to other Landsat-related biomass estimation research [40]. However, it has been stated that Landsat 8 has a refined near-infrared spectral band for more accurate spectral acquisition when compared to the Landsat former series [11], but the advantage in the near-infrared band of OLI Band 5 over TM Band 4 remains to be further investigated.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Comparison of Variable Importance,4
341,"The total afforested area in Zhejiang Province increased from 2010–2012, but slightly decreased from 2013–2015 (Table 7). In addition, the total forestry production value increased from 2010–2015 (Figure 11). This implies that afforestation in the future will be limited by the finite area of land resources combined with rapid socioeconomic consumption, which indicates that the configuration characteristic of Zhejiang forests will change from quantity augmentation to quality improvement. Biomass is defined as the total amount of organic matter present at a given time per unit area and is the foundation of energy and nutrient exchange for forest ecosystem. Therefore, it is usually treated as an important indicator of forest quality, and the results of our previous study showed that forest policy implementation of ecological forests was beneficial for the increase of biomass [9]. Thus, proper management such as establishing nature reserves, implementing forest protection policies, and enhancing public awareness of forest ecological benefit would have a powerful effect on the spatial change of biomass.In this context, forest protection campaigns such as plain greening and ecological forests, which promote afforestation and prohibit deforestation, will provide a better environment for biomass accumulation and in some way explain the general increasing tendency of AGB in our study area. The government of Wuyi County delimited the ecological forest in 2001, and up to September 2010, the provincial ecological forest reached 42,894.89 ha, which accounted for 44.72% of the total forested land area in Wuyi [41]. It holds a larger proportion of mountain areas with relatively high forest age that promote higher biomass density. Comparably, there has been 18,996.21 ha of ecological forest in Dinghai District until 2015, holding a proportion of 64.2% [42]. Additionally, Xianju is one of the earliest pilot counties in Zhejiang province to implement the ecological forest program. Therefore, all of these measures would facilitate biomass increase.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. The Effect of Forest Policy on Biomass Spatiotemporal Variations,4
342,"Biomass distribution is effected by many factors. In this study, we focus on the relationship between AGB and three important topographic factors including elevation, slope, and aspect among different regions. By summing up the above results, some interesting points have been found. For the elevation feature, AGB in the three regions had a positive correlation with elevation more or less, especially for Xianju County. At the same time, it should be pointed out that when the elevation was higher, the AGB change obtained quite different trends in the three regions, where Wuyi, Xianju, and Dinghai had negative, positive, and insignificant correlations with elevation, respectively. As stated in the study of Zhang et al. [43], the property of main local tree species largely determined the characteristics of biomass spatial and temporal variation. There is a great percentage of broad forest in Xianju County, especially for the locations in the ecological forest, whose community composition containing large broadleaf species is mainly distributed at higher altitudes with better hydrothermal conditions. This may be the reason why in this region, AGB increases faster in higher mountains than that in flat areas. However, in Wuyi, a possible reason to explain why lower regions have a larger magnitude of AGB increase is that forest management activities like plain greening and ecological forest construction have been implemented [41]. Furthermore, the relatively limited elevation with a highest elevation below 400 m and the surrounding sea and ocean environment lead AGB in Dinghai to have a weakened relation with elevation.With regard to slope, AGB/change in the three regions had significant relations with slope to varying degrees. Both in 2010 and 2015, AGB in Wuyi, Xianju, and Dinghai had a positive relation with slope. Du et al. assumed that vegetation distributed in higher slopes avoided the frequent intervention of human activity, and could be better preserved, contributing to more plentiful forest growth that promoted biomass accumulation [25]. However, in Wuyi and Dinghai, AGB acquired a negative increase when the slope was larger than 45°.When it comes to aspect, it seems that aspect only had a significant correlation with AGB/change to some extent. Aspects in the south, southwest, west, and northwest are called sunny slopes [44,45], and AGB in these aspects achieved a larger magnitude of increase in Xianju. However, AGB at different aspects in Wuyi and Dinghai had no distinct difference. Comparably, aspect had the lowest relation with AGB and its change among the three topographic factors.When comparing the relative importance of the three terrain parameters, elevation and slope both played significant roles in temporal AGB change. Although all features influenced AGB in Xianju, a typical mountainous area, elevation was at the top of the list. By comparison, slope was inclined to be the most important determinant for the island region of Dinghai. In Wuyi, slope also had a relatively more significant relation with AGB. Despite this, at the provincial level, Du et al. found that forest carbon density increased with higher altitude in Zhejiang Province [25]. The situation becomes complicated when the provincial scale changed to smaller regional scales. In our study, unambiguous principles to explain the AGB-terrain relationship in the three regions are still needed in further investigations, as a number of studies has found that topography is closely related to solar radiation, temperature, moisture, and soil condition, all these interrelate with vegetation growth and human activities [9,46,47]. The objective of this study was to reveal the relationship between AGB/change and topography factors, while the spatiotemporal characteristics of AGB should be explained by the combination of natural condition and anthropogenic behavior.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. The Terrain Impact on Biomass Distribution and Change,4
343,"Although the spatial AGB maps in different periods were produced and the characteristics of AGB/change were analyzed, further studies should be conducted in the future. First, TM images for Wuyi County (in May and October) and Xianju County (in 2007) were an expedient selection restricted by the coverage of clouds, as mentioned above. Strictly speaking, remote sensing data should be selected by referring to field data to ensure that both were collected from the same period. Second, total biomass should include tree trunks, branches, and foliage, but the optical imagery we used captured only the signals from the vegetation canopy, and even contained noise from soil and other environmental backgrounds, which resulted in great uncertainty in the biomass estimation. Lidar has been widely used as it has the ability to provide vertical information that is closely related to AGB [48,49]. Third, the random forest algorithm was used to produce the AGB map and rank the relative importance of selected variables, but it is still a black box in which the interaction mechanism between remote sensing data and forest biochemical parameters is unrevealed. Approaches with more distinct mechanisms can be explored. Fourth, limited by our available forest investigation dataset, a typical region representing plain terrain in the north of Zhejiang has not be included to form a more comprehensive comparison. Fifth, time series biomass estimation should be used instead of bi-temporal biomass change to find more valuable and detailed information [50]. It should be noted that in this study, the mean aboveground biomass density in Dinghai district was the lowest, but when investigating the industrial structure in three regions, Dinghai had the highest GDP (gross domestic product) during 2010–2015 (Figure 12). Therefore, more frequent remote sensing imagery can be explored to find out whether a correlation exists between biomass and socioeconomic factors.", 4. Discussion, 4.4. Future Works,4
344,"The distribution of aboveground biomass changes with various natural and anthropogenic environment conditions. Remote sensing provides a nondestructive and efficient way to describe the temporal and spatial characteristics of this information and has earned increased attention in recent years. In this study, Landsat imagery covering three regions in Zhejiang Province, China, was collected, representative of different topographic regions including basin, island, and mountain areas. Combined with field-measured plots, bi-temporal aboveground maps (2010 and 2015) were produced based on the random forest algorithm. The spatial distributions and changes in AGB were investigated and analyzed through establishing stratified topographic categories based on DEM data. As a result, the biomass in all regions increased from 2010–2015. In the basin region that had more frequent human activities, forests in lower-altitude regions had higher biomass increases. In the mountain region, AGB was uppermost influenced by elevation, and forests at higher elevations acquired both a higher value and an increased magnitude. For the islands, with limited elevation and water surrounding environment, the dominant influence for AGB/change was inclined to be the slope. Comparatively speaking, aspect had the weakest relation with AGB. More works should be done to clarify the complex relationships between AGB and diverse terrain conditions.The local government of Zhejiang Province has taken such actions as plain greening and ecological forest implementation to promote the increase of forest coverage and prevent deforestation, which is beneficial to regional forest ecosystems. In the future, with the excavation of limited potential forests, the improvement of forest quality should be the focus of forest management. Biomass is an important parameter for forest ecosystem assessment. As shown by this study, the interaction between natural conditions and human activities, which cannot be completely separated, exerts considerable influence on local forests. Remote sensing-based biomass estimation, with especial attention paid to regional heterogeneity, can provide scientific guidance for natural resource management.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
345,"Forests cover approximately 30% of the total land area and account for 80% of Earth’s total plant biomass [1,2]. Forests’ ecosystems contribute 75% of the terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) and contains more carbon in plants and soils than those contained in the atmosphere [2,3]. Therefore, knowledge of the distribution and biomass density of forests is critical for understanding the global carbon balance and, further, for research on climate change.Several satellite missions aiming at the monitoring of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) have been launched or scheduled, such as the L-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR) onboard the advanced land observing satellite (ALOS) launched by the Japanese Space Agency (JAXA) in 2006 [4], the advanced land observing satellite 2 (ALOS-2) equipped with an enhanced L-band SAR (PALSAR-2) [5], the BIOMASS mission of European Space Agency specifically designed for the measurements of forest AGB and its changes [6], and so on. In addition to these satellite missions, several regional maps of forest AGB or related forest structure parameters have been released [7,8,9]. For example, Blackard et al [10] mapped the forest AGB of the United States of America using the ground inventory, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, and other ancillary data; Saatchi et al [11] mapped the total carbon stock in the live biomass of all tropical forests by extrapolating the in situ inventory and the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) footprints using optical and microwave imagery. However, Rodríguez-Veiga et al [12] reported obvious discrepancies in existing forest biomass stock maps with in-situ observations in Mexico. As pointed out by Hall, F.G., et al. [13], these existing global or regional datasets were only approximations based on combining land cover types and representative values instead of measurements of actual forest aboveground biomass. The importance of uncertainty analysis for remote sensing-derived forest AGB estimates has been recognized in last decade [14,15]. The high-quality ground reference data is the prerequisite of the mapping of forest AGB and the uncertainty analysis [16,17]. As pointed out by Lu et al [16], the identification of sensitive variables should be based on correlation analysis between ground reference data and potential variables; the estimation model was developed by relating ground reference data with selected variables; the model evaluation and uncertainty analysis also relies on the ground reference data. The collection of ground reference data is always carried out through field measurements over forest plots. The structure parameters of each tree within the plots are recorded, including diameters at breast height, tree species, and the heights of selected representative trees. This collection of ground reference data is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and the number of sampling plots is always limited due to the cost. Moreover, uncertainties associated with this kind of data collection also exist. For example, the uncertainties caused by the inaccurate positioning of sample plot centers or corners due to the low signal quality of global positioning systems (GPS) [18,19,20]; the measurement of tree heights is always interrupted by the complex forests vertical structures preventing surveyors targeting tree canopy tops correctly from the ground [21]; another uncertainty that appears when relating with the remote sensing dataset is that the boundary of the sampling plot cannot exactly coincide with the boundary of remote sensing pixels. Although field measurements are associated with these uncertainties, they are considered to be the most accurate source of data we can obtain. Therefore, we cannot completely eliminate field measurements, but we can reduce the number of sample plots and make the data collection and biomass estimation more efficient and effective with the help of other tools.The stereo imagery acquired by optical sensors onboard an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) could be one choice for the collection of reference data of forest AGB. Studies on the measurements of forest spatial structures using stereo imagery have been booming in recent years due to the rapid development of UAV platforms and the automatic processing algorithms of stereo imagery [22,23,24,25,26,27]. The stereo images acquired by consumer-grade cameras are good enough for stereoscopic processing using algorithms from computer vision [26]. This facilitated the application of low-cost UAV with low payload capability in the acquisition of stereo imagery.The application of UAV stereo imagery as a practical sampling tool of forest AGB is hindered by the unavailability of ground surface elevation under forest canopies. The results derived from stereo imagery are the digital surface model (DSM) of the forest canopy top. A digital terrain model (DTM) of the ground surface under forest from other data sources is needed to extract the forest’s vertical structures. Many studies on the extraction of forest spatial structures using airborne stereo imagery used the DTM from lidar data [28,29,30]. In this way, the application of UAV stereo imagery is limited within the area where the lidar DTM is available. Some studies reported that point cloud of stereo imagery acquired in leaf-off conditions could see the ground surface through the deciduous forest canopy [26,31]. Our previous studies evaluated the impact of forward overlaps and image resolutions for the mapping of forest three-dimensional structures using UAV stereo imagery [32], and also reported the estimation of the forest leaf area index using height and canopy cover extracted from UAV stereo imagery [33]. This study reported our new results on the inventory of forest aboveground biomass over deciduous forest through the synthesis of leaf-on and leaf-off UAV stereo imagery by taking lidar data as references.", 1.

346,"The study area is located at the Genhe forest bureau in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China (50°56′N, 121°29′E) on the northwest slope of Daxing’an Mountains. This area is on the southern border of boreal forest and belongs to the frigid-temperate zone of the coniferous forest vegetation. The elevation of this area ranges between 650 m–1269 m. The annual mean temperature is −5.4 °C, while the minimum temperature is −52.6 °C. This area is referred to as the cold polar of China. The annual mean precipitation is 450~550 mm, 60% of which occurs during July and August. The soil type is brown coniferous forest soil with a thickness of 30 cm~40 cm. 83.7% of the area is covered by forest. The dominant tree species is larch (Larix gmelinii). The main broadleaf deciduous species include white birch (Betula platyphlla) and aspen (populous davidiana). In the study area, the maximum height of the Dhurian larch is about 35 m and the maximum diameter at breast height (DBH) is about 40 cm. ", 2. Test Sites and Data Preparation , 2.1. Test Sites,2
347,"The field sampling was carried out between 10 August and 15 August 2013 by a team under previous project using a plot size of 45 m × 45 m [34]. Each plot was divided into nine subplots with a size of 15 m × 15 m and subplots were numbered serially as shown in Figure 1a. The diameter at the breast height (DBH) of each tree was measured by DBH tape. The heights of the canopy tops and canopy bottoms of each tree were measured by laser range finder. The crown width of each tree at the directions of south to north and east to west were measured by taps. The positions of plot corners were measured by GPS with differential correction, while the relative position of each tree (with DBH > 5.0 cm) within the plots was measured by total stations. In total, seven plots were measured and there were two species of trees located within the plots, i.e. white birch and larch. The biomass of each tree was calculated using the measured DBH and tree heights and the published allometric equations, as shown in Table 1 [35]. The forest AGB of each subplot was the summation of aboveground biomass of all trees divided by the corresponding spatial area. The maximum, minimum, standard deviation, and average forest AGB of all subplots were 184.44 Mg/ha, 21.84 Mg/ha, 39.44 Mg/ha, 74.97 Mg/ha, respectively.", 2. Test Sites and Data Preparation , 2.2.

348,"The lidar system onboard Yun-5 aircraft was the Leica ALS60 (Leica Geosystems, Heerbrugg, Switzerland) system working at 1064 nm and a 166 kHz pulse rate at 1800 m above ground level (AGL). The Yun-5 aircraft carried both the GPS receivers and Inertial Navigation System (INS) simultaneously for recording accurate positions and attitudes of the platform. Three returns were recorded, i.e. first, second and last. The positioning accuracy was estimated as vertical error <15 cm and horizontal error <50 cm by comparing with the ground control points (GCPs) from Real Time Kinematic (RTK) measurements. The Lidar data used in this study was collected from 30 August to 14 September 2012 with a point density of about 2~4 points/m2. Please refer to [36] for more details on Lidar data acquisition. The lidar point clouds were classified as ground, vegetation, and others using TerraScan software (TerraSolid Ltd, Helsinki, Finland, http://www.terrasolid.com/home.php) [37]. The DTM of the ground surface with a pixel size of 0.5 m was produced through the rasterization of the ALS ground points. The first return of the ALS point cloud was rasterized to produce a digital surface model (DSM) with a pixel size of 0.5m. If only one point was located within a pixel, the elevation of the point was used as the pixel value. If there were more than one point within a pixel, the mean height of vegetation points was used as the pixel value. The difference between DSM and DTM was the mean canopy height model (MCHM). The pixels with heights of <2.0 were set as 0.0 m to exclude shrubs and non-woody vegetation. The mean forest height of each plot was calculated by averaging all MCHM pixels, including both bare ground and vegetation pixels. The mean forest height of each subplot was correlated with the corresponding biomass density to build an estimation model of forest AGB. There were, in total, 63 subplots from 7 sampling plots. All subplots were numbered from 1 to 63 according to their serial number within each plot and the serial number of each plot. The 32 subplots with odd numbers were used to develop an estimation model of forest AGB and the rest of the 31 subplots were used for model validation. Considering that the forest AGB is linearly correlated with forest stocking volume, which is correlated with forest height in the power form as indicated in [38], the power function was chosen to develop an estimation model of forest AGB. Figure 2a shows that the determination coefficient (R2) between mean forest heights and field-measured forest AGB was 0.80, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 24.4 Mg/ha, while Figure 2b shows that the R2 between field measurement and model predicted forest AGB of the validation plots was 0.74 with a RMSE of 16.9 Mg/ha. The MCHM map with a resolution of 15 m was produced in the same way as the calculation of the mean forest height of each plot. Then the forest AGB map produced using the developed model and MCHM, with a resolution of 15 m, is shown in Figure 2c. ", 2. Test Sites and Data Preparation , 2.3. Forest AGB Maps from Lidar Data,2
349,"The acquisition system of stereo imagery was built on a six-rotor helicopter [27]. The camera mounted on the helicopter pointing at nadir was a Sony NEX-5T, which could collect images with 16.10 megapixels. The ground station associated with the UAV system enabled to automatically program the flying routes and the positions to take photos according to system settings, including focal lengths of camera, flying heights, forward overlaps, side overlaps, and flying speeds. The duration of each flight was determined by the battery capacity. Taking the battery of 16000 mAh used in this study for example, it was about 18–20 minutes flying at about 300 m AGL with a flying speed of 10 m/s. The forward overlap used in this study was about 90% while the side overlap was about 60%. The stereo imagery used in this study was collected by flying along the same routes on 25 August 2014 and 5 May 2015, corresponding to leaf-on and leaf-off seasons, respectively. The focal length and shutter speed used in image collection was 16 mm and 1/600 s, respectively. 776 images stored in the RGB format were used in this study. The spatial resolution or the ground sample distance (GSD) of the stereo imagery was about 8.6 cm.", 2. Test Sites and Data Preparation , 2.4. Collections of UAV Stereo Imagery ,2
350,"The stereo images were processed using the Agisoft Photoscan software package (version 1.2.2, build 2294, 64 bit). The processing algorithm was procedures of structure from motion (SfM). The three-dimensional modeling equations used in SfM only need relative positions and orientations of the camera, which can be calculated using identified matching points. The point cloud in local relative coordinate systems can be determined based on the numerous overlapping stereo images [39]. The real three-dimensional model was produced by transforming the relative point cloud into geo-referenced coordinates using GCP. Correspondingly, there were three basic steps involved in the stereo processing: (a) Image alignments, i.e. the relative positions and orientations of images were estimated using the key points extracted from images through analyses of image textures; (b) dense point cloud generation, i.e. based on the estimated relative positions and orientations of images—the depth information for each camera was calculated and then combined into a single dense point cloud. Five levels of quality of point densification are provided in the software, including lowest, low, medium, high, or ultra-high. The ultra-high level was used in this study to get the densest point cloud. (c) Coordinates transformation, i.e. the geo-referenced coordinates of point cloud was calculated from the relative coordinates using GCP. Three options were provided in step (b) to determine the filtering degree, including “mild,” “aggressive,” and “moderate.” For forested areas, the “mild” was recommended because the sparse single trees were always filtered out as noise by the other two settings. The default values of other parameters were used in this study. The field measurement of GCP using GPS with differential correction was time-consuming in field work. The longitude, latitude, and elevation of GCPs used in this study were directly collected on the very height resolution (VHR) images in Google Earth™. The same GCPs were used for the stereo imagery of both leaf-on and leaf-off to minimize their divergence. The spatial distributions and the positioning errors of GCPs were shown in the results section. ", 2. Test Sites and Data Preparation , 2.5. Stereoscopic Processing,2
351,"The direct results of the stereoscopic processing of images acquired in the leaf-off season are point clouds located on the vegetation and ground surfaces. The prerequisite of DTM extraction is to remove vegetation points. A simple automatic algorithm based on iterative median filtering (IMF) is used to identify ground points from the point cloud of the stereo imagery acquired on leaf-off season. The algorithm is described as follows: (1) Point cloud is rasterized to produce an elevation image with a given pixel size, such as 5.0 m;(2) The elevation image is filtered by median filter with a given window size, such as 13 × 13;(3) The filtered elevation image serves as a template to screen out point cloud; points above the template are discarded if their vertical distance to the template is larger than a given threshold, such as 1.5 m;(4) the remained point cloud is processed by repeating steps (1)–(3) until the number of discard points is smaller than a given threshold, such as 1%.The DSM of the forest canopy top could be generated by rasterizing the point cloud of leaf-on with a resolution of 0.5 m in the same way as the rasterization of lidar point cloud. The DTM could be produced by the rasterization and interpolation of the filtered point cloud of leaf-off. Therefore, the MCHM could be extracted by subtracting DTM from DSM.", 3. Methods, 3.1.

352,"Considering the fact that the UAV stereo imagery should be available before the field work of tree measurements, this study proposed to determine positions of field sampling plots on the MCHM of UAV stereo imagery and ortho-rectified mosaic images, because they can provide information about the spatial distribution of forest canopy heights, forest densities, tree species and so on. For the coverage of as full a dynamic range of forest AGB as we can, four types of sampling plots were selected, including low and sparse forests (referred to as type A), low and dense forests (referred to as type B), two-layer forests with sparse higher trees (referred to as type C) and high and dense forests (referred to as type D). Six field sampling plots were selected for each type. The time-cost of field measurements for each plot is directly determined by the size of sampling plots. More time is needed for a larger sampling plot because more trees located within plots should be measured. What is the proper size of sampling plots of the field measurements for the mapping of forest AGB using UAV stereo imagery? In order to answer this question, considering the plot size of field measurement used in this study as in Section 2.2, three sizes of sampling plots were used in this study, i.e. concentric square plots with sizes of 15 m × 15 m, 30 m × 30 m and 45 m × 45 m. The field sampling plots described in Section 2.2 were not located within the coverage of UAV stereo imagery, as show in Figure 1b. Therefore, the values of forest AGB of sampling plots had to be collected from the forest AGB map of lidar produced in the Section 2.3. For 15 m × 15 m plots, the value of forest AGB can be directly collected from the forest AGB map of lidar. For 30 m × 30 m (or 45 m × 45 m) plots, the average of all four (or nine) pixels in forest AGB map of lidar covered by the sampling plot are used as a sampling of forest AGB in the model development. The prediction models were developed by taking the mean pixel values of MCHM of stereo imagery and the forest AGB of sampling plots as explanatory and response variables, respectively. The three MCHM maps with the spatial resolutions of 15 m × 15 m, 30 m × 30 m and 45 m × 45 m were produced using the UAV MCHM with a resolution of 0.5 m in the same as the producing of lidar MCHM maps. The three forest AGB maps of UAV stereo imagery were further generated using the UAV MCHM maps and the corresponding prediction models. The three forest AGB maps of UAV stereo imagery were evaluated by taking that of lidar data as reference. The evaluation was carried out using the pixel by pixel comparison between the forest AGB maps of UAV and those of lidar.", 3. Methods, 3.2. Mapping of Forest AGB Using MCHM of UAV Stereo Imagery,3
353,"Figure 3 showed the ortho-rectified mosaic images and DSM of UAV stereo imagery acquired in leaf-on and leaf-off seasons over the test site. The reported density of point cloud extracted from the UAV stereo imagery of leaf-on and leaf-off was 32.4 point/m2 and 35.9 point/m2, respectively. The UAV trajectory was overlaid on Figure 3a showed as yellow lines. The coverage area was about 1.52 km2 with a 1.6 km length and 0.95 km width. Both the leaf-on and leaf-off stereo imagery were collected along the same trajectory within one flight with an effective duration of flight of about 12 minutes. One obvious difference between leaf-on and leaf-off was that more roads were visible in Figure 3b than in Figure 3a. There were no harvesting activities that occurred between the two flights, but the snow covered the ground, and the leaves were off during the collection of early spring images. The accuracy of GCP was shown in Table 2. The standard deviation of GCP in leaf-off season along the direction from west to east was 0.59 m, while that along the direction from south to north was 0.48 m. The vertical accuracy was 0.8 m. For GCP in leaf-on season, the vertical accuracy was 0.83 m, while the horizontal accuracy was 0.34 m and 0.32 m along the direction from west to east and the direction from south to north, respectively.The accuracy of GCP reported in Table 1 indicated the relative co-registration errors between the UAV imagery of Leaf-on and Leaf-off. The absolution positioning error is evaluated by making an accurate co-registration between the DSM of Leaf-on and that of lidar using the method proposed in [40]. The results show that the horizontal offset between the two DSM is about 3.63 pixel (3.63 pixel * 0.5 m/pixel = 1.815 m) and 0.67 pixel (0.67 pixel * 0.5 m/pixel = 0.335 m) along the X and Y directions, respectively. For the field plot with a size of 15 m × 15m or even larger, the positioning error was only about 1/10 of plot size, which is acceptable.", 4. Results, 4.1. UAV Stereo Imagery,4
354,"Figure 4 shows the results of the extraction of ground surfaces using leaf-off stereo imagery by the IMF at different aspects. The number and percentage of points removed in each iteration is shown in Figure 4a. It is clear that the vegetation points are mostly removed in the first two iterations. The number of removed points decreased gradually after each iteration and was lower than 1% after the fifth iteration. Figure 4b shows the identification of ground points along a profile over flat terrain conditions. The profile is a subset of the point cloud along the X direction (from west to east) with a length of 115 m. It could be seen that the identified points gradually approached the ground surface. The difference between iterations becomes very weak after the third iteration. Figure 4c depicts the vertical distribution of points over a forest stand of 30 m × 30 m. The vertical distribution of the remaining points concentrates gradually on the ground surface. Figure 4 showed that the elevation of ground surface can be extracted well by the IMF algorithm in both flat and mountainous areas. The MCHM extracted by the synergy of point cloud of leaf-on stereo imagery and the filtered point cloud of leaf-off stereo imagery is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5a,b are the leaf-on UAV MCHM and lidar MCHM, respectively. The two images look nearly identical at a first glance. These results demonstrated that the elevation of ground surface extracted from the point cloud of leaf-off stereo imagery by IMF was enough. In addition, the point cloud of leaf-on stereo imagery and leaf-off stereo imagery has been co-registered accurately enough by the GCPs; otherwise, there would be terrain-related errors remained in Figure 5a caused by their mis-registration. The comparison between the leaf-on UAV MCHM and lidar MCHM is shown in Figure 5c,d along two profiles which are identical to Figure 4d,e respectively. The changing trends of forest heights along profiles of leaf-on UAV MCHM and lidar MCHM were consistent. The pixels where the leaf-on UAV MCHM was higher than the lidar MCHM could be attributed to the bad penetration abilities of stereo imagery over higher tree neighboring those pixels. The pixels where the leaf-on UAV MCHM was lower than lidar MCHM were caused by a failure to catch the canopy tops of trees neighboring those pixels. ", 4. Results, 4.2.

355,"The positions of 24 sampling plots are shown in Figure 6a. The symbols of yellow dots, blue dots, yellow stars, and blue stars represent the sampling plots of type A, type B, type C, and type D, respectively. Three concentric square plots with different sizes as shown in Figure 6b are setup at each position to evaluate the effects of plot size on the accuracy of prediction models based on UAV stereo imagery. The MCHM images of four 45 m × 45 m sampling plots representing four stand categories are shown in Figure 7. Figure 7a to Figure 7d are the MCHM of the UAV stereo imagery with a resolution of 0.5 m corresponding to the sampling plots of A1, B1, C1, and D1. Figure 7e to Figure 7h are the vertical distribution of points corresponding to Figure 7a to Figure 7d.The prediction models of forest AGB using mean forest heights from UAV stereo imagery take the form of power functions as that of lidar. The model coefficients and accuracy are shown in Table 3. The scattering plot of the forest AGB from lidar against that predicted by the prediction models is given in Figure 8. Both Table 3 and Figure 8 show that the differences of prediction accuracy from the models developed at different plot sizes are not obvious in terms of R2. The accuracy differences in terms of RMSE are also weak, which is about 1.8 Mg/ha between 15 m × 15 m and 30 m × 30 m, and 1.4Mg/ha between 30 m × 30 m and 45 m × 45 m. Figure 9 shows that the forest AGB of sampling plots scattered evenly among the dynamic range from 0 to 140 Mg/ha. The results show that the dynamic range of forest AGB can be covered by sampling plots selected on MCHM of UAV and ortho-rectified mosaic image. Three maps of forest AGB from UAV are produced by the three prediction models developed at sampling plot sizes of 15 m × 15 m, 30 m × 30 m and 45 m × 45 m. Figure 9 shows the validation of forest AGB maps by taking those of lidar as a reference. The three forest AGB maps of the UAV stereo images are highly correlated with those of the lidar data with correlation coefficients (R2) larger than 0.94 and the root mean square errors (RMSEs) are smaller than 10 Mg/ha. No obvious differences or trends of the estimation accuracy of forest AGB are observed along with the changes of sampling plot sizes. The results indicate that the field sampling plots with a size of 15 m × 15 m are large enough, at least over the research area of this study, for the mapping of forest AGB using UAV stereo imagery.

356,"Four parameters are needed in the proposed IMF algorithm, i.e. the pixel size used in the rasterization of point cloud, the window size used in median filtering, the threshold of vertical distance to the template, and the number of iterations. The requirement for pixel size is not rigorous. The ranges from 1.0 m to 10.0 m are acceptable for stereo imagery with a resolution smaller than 0.1 m, as used in this study. There will be no sufficient number of points for the interpolation if the pixel size is too small, while the small terrain features will be missed if the pixel size is too large. The IMF algorithm is also not sensitive to the filtering window size. The ranges from 3 × 3 to 15 × 15 are all acceptable. The difference between different window sizes is the work efficiency. More iterations are needed for smaller window sizes because most features of forests’ vertical structures are retained. A filtering widow size that is too large is not suggested because detailed terrain features will be missed, as in the case of the large pixel size used in the rasterization. The threshold of vertical distance to the template is a critical parameter of IMF because points having a vertical distance larger than the threshold are directly discarded. The larger threshold will slow down the filtering process while a smaller threshold will remove the point of the ground surface on the slope. The minimum of the threshold should be the integrated consideration of terrain slopes, pixel size, and filtering window size to guarantee that the threshold is larger than the elevation fluctuation of ground surfaces. In this study, the fixed threshold was used because the elevation dynamics over the coverage area are narrow. In future studies, it would be worthwhile to adjust the threshold adaptively for application over larger areas with broader dynamics of ground surface elevations. The last parameter of IMF is the number of iterations. The results in this study showed that the filtering should be stopped when the number of points removed is lower than 1% of the original point number. This parameter, in fact, is not particularly important because the intermediate results can be saved in the filtering process. Users can determine which one is the best result by comparing these intermediate results.", 5. Discussions, 5.1. Extraction of Ground Surface ,5
357,"The applicable area of this study is limited to deciduous forests. This limitation is mainly due to the availability of ground surface elevations under forest canopies because the leaf-off conditions increase the probability to see through the forest canopies over the deciduous forest. In fact, the description of forest spatial structures mainly comes from the UAV stereo imagery of leaf-on. The UAV stereo imagery is anticipated to also have good performance over evergreen forest areas if a high quality elevation dataset of the ground surface under the forest canopy is available or over sparse forest areas like savanna or forest shelterbelts.", 5. Discussions, 5.2. The applicable Areas of UAV Stereo Imagery,5
358,"It must be noted that some kinds of uncertainties existed in this study. The most obvious uncertainty is the mis-match of acquisition dates of data used in this study. The lidar data was collected in 2012, the field measurements were carried out in 2013, and the UAV stereo imagery was collected in 2014 and 2015. Considering that the forest structure is, in fact, derived from leaf-on stereo imagery, the time interval between lidar and UAV stereo imagery is about two years. No obvious or severe human disturbances occurred in these two year. The forest growth is slow because the growing season of this area is only about four months from late May to early September. It could be anticipated that the correlation between forest biomass from lidar and that from UAV stereo imagery might be improved or at least might not be decreased if these two datasets were acquired in the same period. Another uncertainty is the different point density. The point density of lidar data is about 2 ~ 4 points/m2 while that of the UAV stereo imagery is higher than 30 points/m2. The holes within forest canopies can be observed on the DSM of the lidar data, with a resolution of 0.5 m. The point cloud of UAV stereo imagery was rasterized into the DSM with a resolution of 0.5 m to reduce the uncertainty of unmatched point densities. In this study, the forest AGB measurements for the developments of prediction models of UAV stereo imagery was collected on the forest AGB maps of lidar data, due to the unavailability of field measurements within the coverage of UAV stereo imagery. Although the analysis was carried out on the forest AGB, the comparison was in fact equivalently made on the vertical forest structures detected by UAV stereo imagery and those detected by lidar data. The uncertainties, exhibited on fine resolutions such as 15 m × 15 m, as shown in Figure 9, could be attributed to their different performances of the detection of forest vertical structures. For example, the small gaps between crowns could be seen by lidar data but missed by UAV stereo imagery, as shown in Figure 5c,d. Inversely, the lidar data was easily affected by the gaps within crowns, while the UAV stereo imagery could describe crowns with good geometrical shapes by overpassing those gaps within crowns. In future studies, the UAV stereo imagery should be further evaluated against the field measurements of trees. ", 5. Discussions, 5.3. Uncertainties ,5
359,"The application of UAV stereo imagery as a practical sampling tool of forests is limited by the ground surface elevation under the forest canopy. Most studies on the extraction of forest spatial structures using UAV stereo imagery used the DTM from lidar data. Therefore, they are mostly limited within the area where the lidar DTM is available. In this study, we proposed a new way to extract the deciduous forest canopy height without the help of the lidar DTM. The central idea is that the synthesis of UAV stereo imagery acquired under leaf-on and leaf-off condition. The point cloud derived from the leaf-off UAV stereo imagery was firstly processed by the proposed algorithm of iterative median filtering to remove points from forests. The digital terrain model (DTM) was produced by the rasterization of filtered point cloud. The digital surface model (DSM) of the forest canopy top was generated by rasterizing the point cloud derived from the leaf-on UAV stereo imagery. The mean forest canopy height model (MCHM) was derived from the DSM subtracted by the DTM. The results showed that the terrain information in the DSM could be removed in the MCHM. The extracted MCHM was further used for the mapping of forest AGB. Results showed that forest AGB maps from UAV stereo imagery were highly correlated with those from the lidar data with R2 higher than 0.94 and RMSE lower than 10.0 Mg/ha. The underestimation of AGB by UAV data was observed. The reason for this underestimation should be explored over more test sites in the future.", 6. Conclusion ,None,6
360,"Tropical vegetation holds the lion’s share of the global terrestrial carbon (C) pool stored in aboveground plant biomass [1]. However, due to a lack of ground data available for tropical forests, our knowledge on how much biomass is stored in these ecosystems is still highly uncertain. Such uncertainties arise because in spite of ongoing initiatives, only a small proportion of this vast and spatially variable ecosystem has, so far, been surveyed by traditional forest inventories [2,3]. A general technique to measure aboveground biomass (AGB) in situ is to destructively sample and extract basic structural variables of the vegetation at the individual level and then to develop calibrated allometric (size-to-mass) relationships for upscaling to the plot-level based on biometric vegetation parameters [4,5]. The main horizontal structural vegetation parameters collected in forest inventories are the tree diameter at breast height (DBH), the stem basal area (BA), and number of individuals (Ni); the main vertical variables are the total tree height (Ht), the commercial height (Hc), the leaf area index (LAI), and the canopy architecture [4,5,6,7,8]. Each of these estimated parameters is associated with measurement errors; therefore, it is important to identify the underlying sources and relative magnitudes of uncertainty as respective errors will add up in compound estimates of vegetation biomass [4]. Such errors are associated with uncertainties due to the deviation of tree trunks from a perfect circular shape (irregular trunks and/or buttresses) and to the rate of trunk circumference decline with height, branching patters, identification of highest point on a tree, as well as variability of wood density (ρ) among species and within species from different areas [2,3,4]. For instance, it has been demonstrated that a 5% error in tree diameter and a 10% error in tree height and wood density can lead to a 21.6% uncertainty in estimates of aboveground biomass [9]. This highlights the importance of assessing the respective measurement errors and also indicates that cumulative errors could propagate to even larger uncertainties when incorporated into allometric equations for estimating aboveground biomass [5]. As a result, AGB estimates are dependent on the particular choice of allometric equations based on the set of variables used for parameterization [10] because these parameters vary in relation to the spatial heterogeneity of tropical landscapes and among surveyed tree communities [2,3,4]. Recently, novel technologies based on light detection and ranging (LiDAR) have proven successful for the calibration of allometric models and, thus, could represent a nondestructive alternative to traditional destructive sampling techniques [11]. LiDAR technology is able to determine the distance between the instrument and a specific object by measuring the timespan between the emission and return of a laser beam with millimetric precision [12] and, thus, is capable of creating three-dimensional images of a given object based on recording the returns of light pulses emitted from the device [12,13]. Depending on the scale of interest, three types of LiDAR are used for the analysis of vegetation structure in forest ecosystems, i.e., spaceborne, airborne, and terrestrial LiDAR. Spaceborne LiDAR is currently limited to 3 years of data and has a relatively large footprint of the order of tens of meters and, hence, does not provide wall-to-wall coverage. Airborne LiDAR provides higher spatial detail but covers relatively smaller spatial areas. Both have been successfully tested at the global [14,15], continental [16], and national levels [17] but are limited by cloud cover and penetration through the canopy. Terrestrial LiDAR is being used for a more detailed analysis of the complex vegetation structure sampled across smaller spatial areas (<1 ha) down to the level of single trees [18,19,20]. At the plot level, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) allows the extraction of biometric variables, such as, leaf, branch, and trunk volume, as well as canopy architecture, with remarkable accuracy [12,21,22,23]. So far, studies evaluating the structural parameters using TLS have been conducted mostly in temperate forest ecosystems [19,24,25,26], and this technique might be expected to be less successful in tropical forest ecosystems due to the high structural complexity of tropical vegetation [11,27,28,29,30,31]. One of the main limitations for laser-based technologies in forest environments is the occlusion of the laser beam by the vegetative material present in different layers of the forest stratum [32,33,34,35]. Moreover, the structural complexity of the environment was found to vary throughout the landscape in response to environmental gradients [30,31,32,33]. To cope with the resulting differences in complexity of structural parameters and to reduce the associated measurement errors between surveyed forest plots, the sampling protocols for each variable of interest have been established, focusing on standardization of methodologies among different forest sites and on a greater control of non-sample errors [36,37,38,39,40,41]. Accordingly, strategies for sampling campaigns conducted across tropical and temperate forest plots have been established that are capable of producing point clouds with a uniform point distribution and, thus, should allow for the intercomparison of metrics between instruments, plots, and over time [42]. Indeed, TLS has been reported to yield reliable estimates of structural vegetation parameters across different tropical ecosystems and biogeographic regions, such as Amazonian lowland rainforests [43,44], mangrove forests in southeastern Brazil [45], neotropical rainforests in Costa Rica [31], and palaeotropical forests in Malaysia [28,29]. These studies often reported a higher accuracy of remotely sensed estimates than those applying conventional methods investigating the vegetation structure based on traditional forest inventories [11,46,47]. However, to thoroughly assess the uncertainties of estimated vegetation biomass, it is necessary to compare the respective error metrics among different surveyed vegetation parameters and multiple methodologies applied under comparable in situ conditions and based on the same tree individuals. To that end, we conducted an intensive measurement campaign in central-eastern Amazonian terra-firme forest (1) to compare the measurements of tree diameter and height obtained from traditional inventory techniques and laser-based electronic devices (i.e., terrestrial laser scanner, electronic caliper, and hypsometer); (2) to quantify the total error, the systematic error, and the random error for each of these techniques; and (3) to assess the overall uncertainty of the respective methods for estimating aboveground biomass in tropical forest ecosystems.

361,"For DBH, the tree circumference was measured at 1.30 m above ground level using a 5 m diameter tape (Forestry Supplies, Mississippi, USA). In the case of imperfections or buttresses, the point of measurement (POM) was moved up until the form of the stem normalized following the RAINFOR protocol [38] and this observation was annotated in field worksheets. Additionally, the POM was marked with oil-based paint [36,38]. For Ht, the measurements were obtained with a tape measure of 50 m length (Irwin Tools, North Carolina, USA) at the highest possible point of the tree of interest that could be reached by a professional climber [54,55]. If the highest point was not reached by climbing, a measuring rod was used to reach the highest point of the crown.In this study, the above-described traditional measurements (TM) of diameter and tree height were compared to estimates of Ht and DBH from multiple electronic devices, i.e., a laser rangefinder (TruPulse 360R, Laser Technology Inc., Colorado, USA; Figure 2a) coupled to an electronic caliper (BT MEM, Masser OY, Rovaniemi, Finland; Figure 2b) and connected to a portable computer (Getac T800, Hsinchu County, Taiwan; Figure 2c) integrated via the so-called Field-Map® software bundle (Institute of Forest Ecosystem Research Ltd., Prague, Czech Republic), as well as a terrestrial laser scanner (RIEGL VZ400, Riegl, Horn, Austria; Figure 2d).", 2.

362,"The field-map bundle is composed of three devices (Figure 2a–c). For the evaluation of DBH, two perpendicular (90°) measurements were taken from the trunk at the largest and smallest diameters using an electronic caliper (Figure 2b); at the same, POM as measured with the diameter tape. For the evaluation of Ht, a laser rangefinder (LR, Figure 2a) was used to triangulate following the tangent method [56]. The electronic devices are wirelessly connected to a portable computer (Figure 2c) where data can be accessed directly in the field and extracted later via portable media (e.g., memory card or pen drive) or sent over wireless networks (Bluetooth). The Field-Map® software interface allows the user to note additional observations for each measurement, e.g., change in POM, presence of imperfections, and buttress of the trunk. The device also determines the positions of each tree individual (x, y, z coordinate system) by conducting distance measurements between respective tree individuals and a reflecting target in the center of the plot (considered as the center of the x, y, and z coordinates). This information is used by the Field-Map software to display the position of each tree on a two-dimensional map on the computer screen.

363," Terrestrial Laser ScanningThree-dimensional scans were performed with the RIEGL VZ-400 laser scanner (Figure 2d). The device has a vertical angle range of 30–130° and quickly acquires a large amount of data (300 kHz laser beam repetition rate) by recording multiple laser pulse returns (up to four returns per pulse emitted). The beam divergence of the laser is 0.35 mrad operating in the near infrared range (wavelength 1550 nm) and records targets within a range of 350 m. The scan settings were standardized across multiple scan positions throughout the plot. Briefly, we used a systematic sampling scheme using a central scanning location and further scanning sites in each cardinal direction to cover the plot area by conducting eight to ten overlapping scans with a mean distance below 10 m. Data were collected using the high-speed mode to obtain the maximum amount of laser return points per time, thus improving identification of the forest structure. Furthermore, additional scans were acquired at each scanning location with the instrument tilted 90° from the vertical position to fully sample the canopy. The collection time per position was approximately 2 min for the vertical position and for the tilted (90°) positions. To register the respective scans into a single point cloud, reflective targets made from reflective tape glued onto plastic cylinders 5 cm in diameter and 10 cm in height [42] were distributed throughout the plot. Registration of the Point CloudThe scenes generated by each scan in the previous step were aligned in a common coordinate system forming a single point cloud for the entire plot (Figure 3). This process is defined as the point cloud registration [42,57,58]. The process was performed automatically using the RiSCAN PRO software [59]. The program usually identifies at least four reflective targets shared by each scanning location, which is considered the minimum number to perform a reasonable coarse registration between two consecutive scans [60]. However, the more reflective targets that can be detected during the scanning process, the better the automated registration procedure will perform (Figure 3). Extracting Individual TreesThe treeseg library (https://github.com/apburt/treeseg) was used to extract a point cloud for each individual tree [43]. This library is based on custom algorithms that depend on other open-source libraries such as the Point Cloud Library (http://pointclouds.org), which provides software processing the point cloud [61]. The semiautomatic extraction of each tree in the point cloud generated by multiple scanning was performed by the following steps: (i) tree identification by removing ground points, obtaining vertical slices of the cloud, and fitting cylinders to potential trunks; (ii) the segmentation of each stem up to the position of first branching using Euclidean clustering to remove any neighboring vegetation and assessing the goodness of cylinder fitting from the previous step; (iii) the extraction of the crown from each stem detected by generating a volume of canopy and using a region-based segmentation; and (iv) the visual inspection of the point cloud and, if necessary, manual removal of misidentified points due to neighboring vegetation [43,46,62].  Acquisition of Biometric Variables from the Point CloudFollowing the procedure above, point coordinates for each individual tree were generated using open-source software for point cloud analysis (3D Forest version 0.42; available from www.3dforest.eu; [63]). The software extracts horizontal and vertical structural variables such as DBH, Ht, position of the tree, and volume of sections of the trunk, as well as canopy-related variables such as base height, crown depth, crown area, and volume. For the DBH estimation, we applied two methods: (i) Randomized Hough transformation (TLSRHT) fitting a circle to the horizontal section of the trunk, with an adjusted number of iterations (standard setting n = 200) [64], and (ii) least squares regression (TLSLSR) with an algebraic estimation of the diameter and reduction of the quadratic distance of the adjusted circle [65]. The two methods use only part of the point cloud, i.e., a 10 cm horizontal section of the trunk between 1.25 and 1.35 m above the lowest point determined by the digital terrain model [63] (Figure 4). For the extraction of diameters in a position different from the conventional POM (1.30 m), the stem curve command is able to determine the diameter in different positions of the trunk. The diameters in the stem curve command are located, relative to the base of the cloud, at 0.65 m, 1.3 m, 2 m, and every 1 m until the first bifurcation of the trunk. The stem curve command terminates when the estimated diameter is twice as large as the two diameters above, which indicates the crown expansion in the point cloud [63].For estimates of total tree height (Ht), the program offers two different approaches: (i) The “TLS Height” method defines the height by calculating the difference between the highest and the lowest points in the cloud along the z-axis (ii) the “TLS Length” method that computes the largest Euclidean distance between a point at the base of the cloud and the farthest point in any direction of the cloud, thus being the method of choice for analyzing inclined trees [63] (Figure 4).", 2.

where Xobserved is the actual measurement for the desired variable, e.g., for DBH, the data obtained from the diameter tape (i.e., by calculating DBH from the circumference measurements) or for Ht obtained with a vertical tape measurement; Xpredicted refers to the biometric data obtained with the electronic devices, i.e., FM and TLS; and n the number of trees. Briefly, the systematic error indicates the tendency of an instrument to record results systematically above or below the actual value (i.e., precision), whereas the random error is the product of the variations in measurements that do not follow a fixed trend and the total error is the product of the estimate (systematic and random error) in relation to the observed in situ measurement (i.e., accuracy).The DBH and Ht obtained through the conventional measurements and the instruments assessed in this study were used as input variables for allometric equations estimating tropical aboveground biomass (AGB). We selected two local equations, derived from central Amazonian inventory plots, and two pantropical equations extracted from the published literature [5,10,69] (see references in Appendix A Table A1). The local equation proposed by Higuchi et al. [69] was used as a reference for calculating the error metrics among AGB estimates resulting from different allometric relationships evaluated in this study. The equation is based on fresh weight from destructively sampled trees and applies a correction factor of 0.6028 (1 − mean moisture content) [70].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Data Analysis,2
369,"Regardless of the instrument used, the estimated DBHs were in good agreement with the measurements obtained with a diameter tape and centered around the 1:1 line for class DBH10–30 cm and DBHAll (Figure 5). However, for both size classes, the coefficient of determination (R2) for measurements conducted with the electronic caliper (each R2 = 0.99) was slightly higher than the estimates derived from TLS using both methods TLSRHT (R2 = 0.93 and 0.96 for class DBH10–30 and all trees, respectively) and TLSLSR (R2 = 0.94 and 0.96, respectively). Such differences in R2 among the different methods were related to respective random errors. Estimates from the electronic caliper exhibited a relatively low random error (Erprop = 2.2% and 2.3%) compared to estimates from TLSRHT (11.6% and 11.0%) and TLSLSR (10.4% and 10.1%). Systematic errors (i.e., errors within methods) were smaller in magnitude when compared to random errors for all three methods and both size classes. TLSRHT exhibited a low systematic error for class DBH10–30. However, this might be a mathematical artifact because negative deviations cancel out positive deviations and vice versa, and therefore, systematic errors can be close to zero (Table 1).For the electronic caliper, the regression coefficients were close to 1 and the intercept close to 0 (Figure 5), whereas for TLSRHT and TLSLSR, the regression coefficients were 0.86 and 0.83 and intercepts were 1.86 and 2.73, respectively, for class DBH10–30. In the class DBHAll, the coefficient keeps close to 1 and the intercept close to 0 for the caliper; for TLSRHT and TLSLSR, the regression coefficients the of the regression had a slight improvement when compared to coefficients in class DBH10–30. In addition, the standard deviation of differences between the diameter tape measurements and the estimates obtained with the caliper was 3–5 times lower than for the estimates from TLS methods for both size classes (Figure 6a). In terms of accuracy (i.e., total errors of respective methods), the electronic caliper presented lower error values for both classes, DBH 10–30 and DBHAll (Table 1). ", 3. Results, 3.1.

370,"Height estimates (Ht) obtained from different instruments presented a relatively lower correspondence to direct observations of tree height obtained from vertical tape measurements (Table 2). For trees with Ht10–20, the heights obtained from the laser rangefinder presented less accuracy (R2 = 0.62 and Erprop = 12.0%) when compared with TLSHeight (R2 = 0.77 and Erprop = 9.1%) and TLSLength (R2 = 0.75 and Erprop = 8.9%). On the other hand, the three methods had similar precisions for height classes of Ht20–35 and Htall, with a decrease in accuracy for the TLSHeight and TLSLength for the Ht20–35 class, but accuracy improved when all tree individuals were considered (Figure 7). This gain in accuracy comes from the expected positive relationship between the number and accuracy of estimates (due to an increase in sample size; Figure A2). Conversely, the standard deviation of the differences was larger for height classes of Ht20–35 and Htall compared to Ht10–20 for the three methods (Figure 6b). In terms of accuracy, there is a clear tendency to overestimate tree heights derived from both TLS methods for the class of Ht10–20. The laser rangefinder, in turn, tends to underestimate smaller trees and overestimate larger trees, respectively (Figure 7).In general, methodological differences in systematic and total errors were comparable among the three methods (Table 2). However, for all of the three methods, there was a tendency to overestimate large trees (Ht20–35); the rangefinder tended to overestimate large trees (at the upper end of the range; cf. slope coefficient > 1), and both TLS methods overestimated tree height of small trees (at the lower end of the range, cf. slope coefficient < 1). Hence, using the hypsometer to estimate tree height tended to overestimate the largest trees with greater total heights, whereas there was a better correspondence between the estimated and observed heights using the TLS method, which indicates that the latter method was not prone to increasing errors with increasing tree size (as highlighted by regression coefficients close to 1 and intercepts closer to 0; Figure 7).

371,"Stem volume (Vstem) and basal area (BA), exhibited values that were close to conventional measurements obtained with the diameter tape (Figure A1). However, estimates obtained with the TLSRHT method and the electronic caliper underestimated the reference measurement conducted with the diameter tape by 4.9% and 6.3% and with an RMSE of 0.20 and 0.09 m3, respectively, while the rangefinder method overestimated by only 0.1%, however, with a high RMSE of 0.2 m3 (Figure A1). For all trees, TLSRHT and caliper measurements underestimated BA calculated from the tape measurement in 4.4 and 5.9% and with an RMSE of 146.7 and 61.4 cm2, respectively; BA calculated from the electronic caliper overestimated by 0.3% and with an RMSE of 145.9 cm2 (Figure A1). Structural parameters that are directly related to the number of individuals (e.g., basal volume and area) within an inclusion limit (usually DBH ≥ 10 cm) can be biased if a different number of tree stems are identified by respective methods (Figure A2). This difference is usually minimal on a plot scale (Figure A1) but can introduce large uncertainties when extrapolated to larger spatial scales.The aboveground biomass estimates differed between allometric equations tested as well as within the same equations depending on the instrument used to collect the input variables to derive the allometric relationships among vegetation parameters and vegetation biomass (Figure 8). Here, we considered the allometric equation presented by Higuchi 1998 (DH) as a reference estimate as it was based on measurements of tree diameter (D) and tree height (H) derived from a destructive harvest in a nearby forest area (cf. Table A1). Both estimates derived from electronic devices overestimated the manual reference estimate by 8.4% and 6.6%, respectively (Table 3). The equation by Higuchi 1998 (D) considering only the diameter (D) as an input variable overestimated the aboveground biomass by 12.9%, 6.4%, and 10.9% for diameter tape (TM), electronic caliper (FM), and TLS, respectively. The two pantropical equations using three parameters (D, H, and ρ) overestimated aboveground biomass (Figure 8, Table 3): the equation by Feldpausch et al. 2012 overestimated the reference measurement by 14.8%, 10.7%, and 17.5% for TM, FM, and TLS respectively; the equation by Chave et al. 2014 overestimated the reference measurement by 27.6%, 23.0%, and 30.5% for TM, FM, and TLS respectively. As a result, the pantropical equations presented relatively large error metrics, such that applying the equations by Feldpausch and Chave resulted in total errors of up to 42–66% (Table 3).In contrast, estimates derived from electronic devices, i.e., FM and TLS, overestimated the reference measurement (Figure 8, Figure A3) by 8.4% and 6.6%, respectively. However, when calculating AGB estimates derived from electronic devices versus traditional inventory techniques within each of the allometric equations, the electronic devices underestimated the AGB estimates (Figure 8, Figure A3) due to a systematic error of −2.4% and −2.6% (Table 3). For all of the allometric equations considered in this study (Table A1), FM underestimated AGB by 7.0%, 3.0%, and 2.9% for Higuchi et al. 1998 (D), Feldpausch et al. 2012, and Chave et al. 2014 respectively, whereas TLS underestimated AGB by 5.0%, 0.7%, and 0.6% for Higuchi (D), Feldpausch, and Chave, respectively (Figure A3).

372,"In general, the difference between tape measurements and caliper measurements increases with tree size as the non-circularity of trunks is more pronounced for large trees with large diameters (Figure 5, Table 1). Hence, a systematic underestimation of measurements obtained with a caliper compared to a diameter tape has been reported for temperate forests [72,73,74] as well as tropical forests [75]. The explanation given is that any deviation from the true circular shape of a given tree trunk will increase the ratio of circumference to area according to the magnitude of the deviation of the circular shape of the perimeter. This implies that irregularly shaped trees, if measured with a diameter tape, will report larger diameters than would be obtained by doing perpendicular stem measurements with a caliper [73]. Interestingly, estimates of stem circumference extracted from the LiDAR point cloud showed the same trend as estimates obtained with an electronic caliper (Figure 5). Because the resulting error for the DBH estimates is related to the correct fit of the circle to the tree trunk, both methods underestimated DBH due to a higher systematic error compared to traditional inventory measurements using a diameter tape (Table 1). However, while the systematic error of the caliper was related to irregularities of the tree stem, the greater random error of the TLS was related to the effect of occlusion by vegetation present in the scanning zone and, therefore, related to the identification of a geometric form when extracting tree circumference from the point cloud [24,28,32,34,46]. This might have led to the observed increasing measurement errors with larger tree diameters (Figure 5), which also corresponded to a greater systematic error and a slight underestimation of DBH with increasing tree size (Table 1). Interestingly, DBH measurements obtained with the electronic caliper showed less total and random error than conventional tape measurements but a higher systematic error due to a slight underestimation of DBH in the large size classes (Figure 5). Accordingly, Calders et al. reported that in contrast to traditional methods, where measurement error typically increases exponentially with increasing DBH, novel laser-based techniques are not dependent on DBH, as TLS does not rely on indirect relationships with tree parameters or calibration data and, therefore, showed better agreement with the reference data [46]. Nonetheless, associated parameters will be biased if not based on the same sample size, i.e., number of tree stems within a given diameter inclusion limit (often DBH ≥ 10 cm), and thus, typically extracted attributes, such as stem volume (Figure A1) and basal area (Figure A2), are related to the number of individual tree stems recorded [76,77]. Hence, a direct comparison among studies using different methodologies is often hindered by the fact that measurement uncertainties are based on different numbers of individuals investigated, as well as different errors metrics obtained by respective method.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Performance of Laser-Based Electronic Devices for Analyzing Horizontal Vegetation Structure,4
373,"Although it has been suggested that it is not feasible to accurately estimate tree height (Ht) in natural forests from the ground-level [55,78], our results suggest that laser-based electronic devices can and should be used to estimate Ht in natural forests [46,56,79,80]. For traditional inventories, tree climbing is often used to characterize vegetation structure in tropical forests [55,81,82], which typically results in an underestimation of total tree height as even a professional tree climber cannot easily reach the very top of a given tree. In contrast, we found that estimates obtained from laser-based electronic devices tend to overestimate Ht when compared to traditional forest inventory measurements (Figure 7). Such a discrepancy between in situ measurements and remotely sensed estimates typically results from the fact that measurements based on trigonometry usually overestimate total Ht because the apex of a tree crown cannot be spotted from the ground by the observer [55]. Therefore, the accuracy of height estimates in tropical forests has been shown to highly depend on the measurement method applied (i.e., tangent vs. sine method) and experience among different operators [55] because the laser beam, in fact, hits the outer edge of the tree crown, which increases the vertical angle and systematically overestimates Ht. Hence, a direct comparison between laser-based estimates and vertical tape measurements is hindered by differences in error metrics. While random errors are typically associated with statistical variability due to the reproducibility of the measurement (i.e., precision), systematic errors typically refer to a statistical bias between a result and a “true” value (i.e., accuracy). In this regard, methods assessing Ht presented in this study showed a relatively high precision but not necessarily a high accuracy compared to traditional measurement techniques found in the literature [56,80,83]. However, as a high accuracy requires both high precision and high trueness, both methods may only be outperformed by destructively harvesting and measuring felled trees, which is laborious and time consuming. Nevertheless, laser-based technologies have been recently used to create locally derived height–diameter relationships, which was shown to result in improved allometric equations estimating aboveground biomass for specific geographic regions [84].So far, most studies comparing height estimates with TLS have been conducted in temperate regions and reported that TLS estimates were better predictors for Ht compared to estimates based on trigonometry with a hypsometer [46]. For tropical regions, estimates of Ht obtained via TLS have usually been compared to estimates obtained from trigonometric techniques [28,31,85,86], which present measurement uncertainties of 0.1 to 7.9 m depending on the method and characteristics of the site [62,87,88,89]. A more robust analysis of natural eucalyptus forest by Calders et al. [46] compared laser-based estimates of Ht to measurements from trees felled after completing the scan, and the associated error metrics showed that TLS estimates were actually more accurate than conventional methods (RMSE 0.55 and 1.28 m, for TLS and LR respectively). This highlights that direct and individual measurements are extremely important for the calibration and validation of remotely sensed vegetation parameters, such as those obtained from airborne LiDAR [90,91,92,93] and spaceborne LiDAR [15,94,95,96]. In particular, terrestrial LiDAR has been highlighted as a promising tool replacing destructive sampling methods [97,98], as local plot-level measurements can be used for the calibration and validation of indirectly assessed allometric relationships to estimate aboveground plant biomass [2]. Furthermore, TLS can derive many more relevant ecological vegetation metrics not commonly assessed by other methods, such as leaf area index, gap fraction, leaf and branch volume, canopy architecture, planar projection, volume, and habitat characterization for fauna or detailed ecophysiological modelling [20,44,63,99]. Nevertheless, each of the estimated parameters will be subject to measurement errors, such that it is crucial to evaluate cumulative errors that could propagate to large uncertainties when incorporated into biomass models [1,41,94]. This calls for studies that determine respective error metrics by comparing multiple methodological techniques at the plot-scale in order to identify relative sources and magnitudes of measurement uncertainties associated with respective method applied in situ [2].", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Performance of Laser-Based Electronic Devices for Analyzing Vertical Vegetation Structure,4
374,"Tropical AGB varies across geographic regions in association with the diameter–height relationship among tropical regions, such that Asian forests although exhibiting higher biomass were underestimated globally due to higher-than-average tree height observed in palaeotropical forests [5]. Due to high variation of allometrical DBH:Ht relationships within tropical forests [6,100], conducting Ht measurements at the local level is of fundamental importance to improve estimates of aboveground biomass [4,10]. For instance, to overcome chronic underestimation of AGB of very large trees, some studies derived local diameter–height allometric models in areas where trees are shorter but have large crowns [70]. However, it has been recently suggested that a relatively simple procedure would be to identify the ten largest diameter trees in a plot for measurements of total height and then take a diameter size-class stratified random sample of an additional forty trees to build a local DBH:Ht model that minimizes uncertainty in estimates of aboveground biomass [84]. Hence, the instruments investigated in this study could and should be used to survey Ht locally in a practical and economically viable way.We furthermore assessed several commonly applied allometric equations to estimate AGB, as some of the differences in biomass estimates might be related to differences in parameterization among allometric equations. For instance, the pantropical equations by Feldpausch et al. [5] and Chave et al. [10] are based on a database compiled from trees felled in the tropics around the world, thus containing trees from different climatic, edaphic, and resource availability gradients [6,7,10,101,102,103]. Even over continental-wide gradients, such as across the Amazon basin, applying adjusted equations for central Amazonia was reported to result in a high bias when estimating tree biomass in the south and southwest of the Amazon [101]. While this was mainly due to differences in wood density [102] and DBH:Ht ratios [91], other studies reported that the use of metrics related to crown volume reduces uncertainties for areas where trees are small statured but have large crowns [70]. This high variation of environmental conditions affecting forest structure among tropical regions implies that local allometries based on locally felled trees and quantifying the biomass of different compartments of the tree [69] are expected to better capture local vegetation characteristics than more general pantropical equations [10]. Hence, in this study, we considered the local allometric equation as the local reference estimate [69]. Compared to the local reference equation (including DBH and Ht), the local diameter-only equation [69], as well as the pantropical equations [5,10], overestimated the aboveground biomass regardless of the technology used (Figure 8). Although both of the pantropical equations were derived from felled trees harvested from forest communities across different tropical regions, the local estimates excluding tree height were still closer to the reference estimate (including DBH and Ht). Surprisingly, in three out of four allometric equations tested, we found an underestimation of biomass by the laser-based electronic devices tested in this study in comparison with conventional measurements (Figure 8). Nonetheless, in comparison TLS-based estimates (TLS) showed a slightly better performance than that based on measurements obtained with the electronic caliper and hypsometer (FM), such that biomass was overestimated by 8.4% and 6.7% by FM and TLS respectively (Figure A3). Whereas laser-based techniques on average overestimated AGB by 16.5% and 18.2% for FM and TLS caused by a systematic overestimation of tree height compared to conventional tape measurements, AGB was underestimated by 4.3% and 2.1% for FM and TLS because of a systematic underestimation of tree diameters with increasing tree size class. Hence, our findings of inverse effects on biomass estimates due to error metrics derived from measurements based on DBH and/or Ht should be of importance for analysis of large-scale AGB estimates derived from remote sensing, particularly applications mapping the forest canopy height to derive biomass estimates across large spatial areas.These nondestructive techniques represent a powerful alternative to destructive tree felling and can be used to estimate the biomass of large trees to within a few percent [2,3,4,44,97]. Recently, studies on native forests of subtropical [46] and tropical climate [11,47] showed that TLS-based AGB estimates were able to estimate the biomass of trees without bias and with shape accuracy when compared to local allometric equations. This finding might be crucial as large-diameter trees (DBH > 60 cm) are usually especially prone to measurement errors [104] but concomitantly represent large parts of the forest ecosystem carbon budget by constituting half of the forest biomass worldwide [105]. Hence, the propagation of measurement errors might introduce some uncertainty to the biomass estimate of a particular site, especially if one single method is used to calibrate products from another platform, e.g., spaceborne and airborne LIDAR, such that local uncertainty could potentially propagate to larger areas. Overall, we conclude that it is crucial to combine several measurement techniques to improve potential mismatches among pantropical allometric equations and local observations. Eventually, further refined novel technologies will represent a valuable alternative to destructive conventional sampling techniques, which should allow assessing the response of tropical plant biomass to projected alterations in climatic signals. ", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Performance of Laser-Based Electronic Devices for Estimating Forest Biomass,4
375,"Based on the results presented in this study, we conclude that laser-based electronic devices have the potential to estimate tree size parameters commonly surveyed by traditional forest inventories. The presented novel techniques exhibited error metrics comparable with traditional methods and differences between respective devices were related to technical attributes of each instrument. Whereas, estimates of horizontal vegetation structure, i.e., tree diameters obtained from the point cloud exhibited relatively high total (11.1%) and random errors (11.0%) compared to measurements taken with a diameter tape, perpendicular measurements with an electronic caliper were more consistent but resulted in systematic underestimation (−2.3%) of individual tree diameters. For vertical vegetation structure, the estimates of tree height based on hypsometer-triangulation gave better results than previously reported (11.7%), while the estimates based on point cloud extraction yielded more consistent results (10.1%) in comparison to vertical tape measurements. Albeit that laser-based techniques systematically overestimated stand aboveground biomass (by 26.6% to 31.0%), this was due to a relatively high precision (−2.5%) within methods but a low accuracy (26.8–31.2%) among predicted and observed values. Most strikingly, the variation of estimated aboveground biomass was larger among commonly applied allometries (39.7–66.4%) than between traditional and novel measurement techniques (10.6–15.0%). This indicates that locally derived estimates based on relatively low sample size (<50 individual stems) could be used to construct local height–diameter relationships with lower error than regional or climate-based allometries. We therefore conclude that laser-based electronic devices can and should be used to complement traditional forest inventories for monitoring structural vegetation parameters in tropical forests.", 5.

376,"Shifting cultivation is a widespread form of land use in tropical regions, and has formed the basis of livelihoods and customs for centuries [1,2,3,4]. This traditional land use still remains central to the livelihoods, culture and food security of millions of people in tropical regions [5]. At the same time, however, shifting cultivation is a direct cause of deforestation, and considered a prominent source of carbon emissions [6,7] with associated biodiversity loss [8,9,10,11]. Tropical countries are, therefore, facing increasing pressure to conserve tropical forests while having to maintain cultivated lands (particularly shifting cultivation) for the subsistence of local people.Where there is a long history of shifting cultivation, patches of successional vegetation intermix with old-growth forests and form spatiotemporally heterogeneous landscape patterns [12]. Such spatiotemporally dynamic and heterogeneous landscapes occur widely across many tropical countries [13,14]. Land patterns that consist of successional vegetation and old-growth matrixes (hereafter referred to as land mosaics) are now regarded as an important provider of ecosystem services in contemporary landscapes dominated by humans [15,16]. In order to design appropriate conservation policies for land mosaics, two different approaches were proposed: a ‘land-sparing’ agricultural approach and a ‘land-sharing’ agricultural approach [15,17,18]. A land-sparing approach suggests reducing the area of farmland by emphasizing high-yielding, more intensive production, and trading reduced ecosystem services within the farmland for the retention of ecosystem services in protected areas. A land-sharing approach integrates food production with the protection of ecosystem services in the same land area [17]. An important question is whether there is a sharp trade-off between the ecosystem services derived from strictly protected areas and the agricultural production from farmlands in land mosaics, or if both ecosystem services and agricultural production can be enhanced in land mosaics. Both approaches can potentially cause a sharp trade-off or the reconciliation of ecosystem service and agriculture. However, such analyses are surprisingly lacking for tropical regions, partly due to the fact that land mosaics are too dynamic to investigate [19]. Therefore, developing an appropriate methodology to investigate the spatiotemporal relationships between ecosystem services and farmlands (particularly shifting cultivation) in land mosaics is needed in order to design appropriate conservation policies [20].To evaluate the spatiotemporal relationships between ecosystem services and farmlands, the integration of ecological understanding and remote-sensing data is crucial [21]. Fujiki et al. [22] found that plant-species composition (richness) and above-ground biomass (a surrogate of carbon stock) demonstrated explicit temporal patterns after the abandonment of slash-and-burn cultivation in the same Bornean upland area where we conducted this study. In this case, the time elapsed after slash and burn is the most important determinant of species composition and biomass in the secondary-vegetation patches of this site. Provided that stand ages (i.e., time elapsed after slash and burn) of vegetation patches are identified by remote sensing, species composition and biomass can be mapped at a landscape level, and even their spatiotemporal patterns can be simulated as a function of time with appropriate land-use scenarios. Fujiki et al. [12] developed an algorithm to estimate stand ages of vegetation patches based on remote-sensing data in the same area as the study of Fujiki et al. [22].Therefore, the objective of our study was to evaluate the spatiotemporal patterns of ecosystem services associated with vegetation succession in the shifting cultivation area by extrapolating the explicit temporal patterns of species composition and biomass derived by Fujiki et al. [22] into the stand-age algorithm developed by Fujiki et al. [12]. Firstly, we evaluated the spatial patterns of plant-species composition and biomass of vegetation patches as of 2010, when high-resolution satellite data were taken. Subsequently, we simulated the future patterns of above-ground biomass using three land-use scenarios and compared the results with the extant patterns as of 2010. Lastly, we discussed how to synergize the conservation of ecosystem services with shifting cultivation and suggested appropriate conservation policies by comparing the scenarios. ", 1. Introduction,None,1.
377,"Our study site is a gap in an upland area between the Kinabalu Park and the Crocker Range Park in Sabah, northern Borneo. We chose this area because it is located within forests that have some of the richest collections of vascular species in the world [23], while at the same time very small patches of fragmented forest are scattered throughout the area. The gap between the two parks is approximately 10 km in length and has long been inhabited by indigenous people who practice shifting cultivation for subsistence. The government of Sabah has set forth a policy to enhance ecological linkages between the two parks by increasing secondary forests as stepping stones in the gap area, and considers REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation-Plus) as an important mechanism to incentivize local people [24]. REDD+ is a financial mechanism to encourage carbon increments (i.e., increased forests) compared with the baseline (i.e., the current practice of shifting cultivation). Therefore, the evaluation and prediction of carbon stock in the gap area are of critical concern to the local government.One family slashes and burns patches of young- to old-growth forests, cultivates upland rice for the first year, and abandons the land for fallow [22]. In between the two parks, there is another local forest reserve (Tenompok Forest Reserve) with pristine vegetation, which is strictly protected from any subsistence use by local regulations. Local people, therefore, conduct traditional shifting cultivation outside of the parks and the reserve. The central point of the study site is at 5°58′ N and 116°29′ E. The altitude of the area ranges from 300 m to 1700 m. The total annual rainfall and mean annual temperature are approximately 2000–2500 mm and 15–24 °C, respectively. The geology of this area consists of tertiary sedimentary rock of the West Crocker Formation [24]. The original vegetation of this area is the lower montane tropical rainforest dominated by the families Fagaceae, Myrtaceae and Lauraceae [25,26]. Fujiki et al. [22] conducted a field survey for 2 months in the same site in August 2012 and August 2013. Details of the field survey were described in Fujiki et al. [22]. In short, they randomly selected a total of 27 stands in this area in order to establish inventory plots. Twenty-five stands were selected to represent the ages of a few to 55 years after shifting cultivation. Two stands were selected in an old-growth forest more than 100 years after slash and burn. The altitudes of these stands varied between 900 m and 1400 m asl. A plot was placed in each stand. Descriptions of stand age, altitude, above-ground biomass (AGB) and dominant species in each of the 27 vegetation stands are shown in Table S1 (cited from Fujiki et al. [22]). We used the same stands for the following analyses to estimate AGB and plant-species composition.We conducted additional field surveys in the same site in April and September 2014 to validate the accuracy of subsequent AGB estimation. The details of the procedure were almost the same as the field survey of Fujiki et al. [22]. Twelve 400-m2 circular plots were randomly established in the area to represent the ages of 4 to 26 years after shifting cultivation (Table S2). The altitudes of these plots varied between 1000 m and 1400 m asl. The diameter at breast heigh (dbh) of all trees (dbh ≥ 5 cm) was measured in each of the main plots while trees with 5 cm > dbh ≥ 1 cm were measured in a sub-plot (25 m2). Global positioning system (GPS) data were collected during the field surveys at the center of a plot with calibration for at least one hour in each plot. We used these additional plots only for validating the results of AGB estimation in the following remote-sensing analysis.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Site and Field Survey,2
378,"Fujiki et al. [22] estimated AGB and analyzed the species composition of plant communities with a multivariate DCA (detrended correspondence analysis) using the same 27 stands. To estimate the AGB of trees with dbh ≥ 1 cm, they used an empirical allometric relationship reported for tropical secondary forests after shifting cultivation in Sarawak, Malaysia [27], with a similar climate and flora as our site:

AGB (kg m−2) = 0.0829 dbh 2.43


(1)

The AGB of trees with dbh ≥ 5 cm in the additional 12 plots were also calculated using the same allometric equation. Fujiki et al. [22] conducted a multivariate DCA to elucidate the gradients in both species composition and their environmental controls using CANOCO Version 4.5 [28] software. DCA was run using the default options, detrending by segments and non-linear rescaling. Fujiki et al. [22] used the relative abundance of each species based on coverage for all inventoried species per stand. They conducted these analyses using 25 stands (age ≤ 55 years) excluding the two oldest stands (age > 100 years), because the exact ages of these stands could not be identified and their species composition was very different from the other stands. The results of DCA are shown by a biplot of stands and species in Figure S1 (cited from Fujiki et al. [22]). They also categorized the same 25 stands into five groups using TWINSPAN. The first group was categorized as herbaceous community with an average height of 3.3 m. The second group was a shrub community with an average height of 7.5 m. The third group was categorized as an upper montane short-forest community above 1100 m asl with an average height of 19.8 m. The fourth group was categorized as a lower montane short-forest community below 1100 m asl. The last group was categorized as an (old-fallow) forest community with the canopy height of 23.0 m. We used these categories to interpret the results of the estimation of plant-community composition in the following remote-sensing analysis.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Field Data Analysis,2
379,"Orthorectified WorldView-2 multi spectral images (22 June 2010), Landsat-5 TM (1 March 1988; 14 June 1991; 22 August 1993; 1 February 1995; 14 June 1997; 8 September 1999; 17 June 2004; 7 June 2006; 28 April 2009) and Landsat-7 ETM+ (19 March 2002) images were used in this study. Details of the pre-processing of the images were described in Fujiki et al. [12]. Briefly, raw digital numbers of each image were converted into surface-reflectance values using the 6S (Second Simulation of a Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum) atmospheric correction model [29]. Topographically induced local variations in angular viewing geometry were reduced using the method described by [30]. All clouds and cloud-shadows in each image were removed by unsupervised classification with ISODATA and visual inspection. ERDAS Imagine (ver.11.0; ERDAS Inc., Norcross, GA, USA) and ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) were used during the entire pre-processing.Details of the process of stand-age estimation can be referred to Fujiki et al. [12]. In brief, we extracted temporal information (i.e., stand ages after shifting cultivation) from a change-detection analysis with Landsat time-series images and superimposed the stand ages on the segments classified by an object-based analysis using WorldView-2. The basic units of object-based analysis were image segments, each of which was composed of spectrally coherent pixel clusters based on homogeneity criteria. Each segment identified by the object-based analysis reflected a land parcel of shifting cultivation where secondary succession proceeded to a variety of stages. Stand ages from change-detection analysis were regarded as a response variable and object-based metrics of each segment as independent variables in order to develop regression models that explained stand ages. Before establishing the regression models, the WorldView-2 segments were divided into some broad vegetation types (i.e., non-vegetated, 1–7 years, 7–50 years, over 50 years, and rubber plantations) with a decision-tree method, using a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) threshold and linear discriminant analyses (LDA). Although each of the 1–7-year and 7–50-year vegetation types was subdivided into several age categories in the original study of Fujiki et al. [12], stand age was estimated as a continuous value ranging from 0 to 50 years in this current study using the same multiple regression models as in Fujiki et al. [12]. We used ERDAS Imagine (ver. 11.0; ERDAS Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA) for the change-detection analysis, and eCognition Developer (ver. 8.7; Definiens AG, Munich, Germany) for the object-based analyses.Subsequently, we used the regression model between stand age and AGB developed by Fujiki et al. [22] (Figure S2a) to estimate AGB at a landscape level, combined with the age-estimation algorithm described above. Fujiki et al. [22] found that species composition was primarily patterned by stand ages (as sorted along axis 1 of the DCA) and, secondly, by stand altitudes (as sorted along axis 2). We, therefore, derived correlation models by regressing DCA axis 1 scores as a response variable with stand ages as an independent variable (Figure S2b), and by regressing DCA axis 2 scores as a response variable with stand altitudes as an independent variable (Figure S2c). The models used in this study are as follows:

GB (Mg ha−1) = 8.38 + 2.53 SA (R2 = 0.88, p < 0.001)


(2)



DCA axis 1 = 1.568 + 1.255 ln (SA) (R2 = 0.69, p < 0.001)


(3)



DCA axis 2 = 7.250 − 0.005 ALT (R2 = 0.44, p < 0.001)


(4)


where SA denotes stand age, and ALT denotes altitude. DCA axis 1 and axis 2 are the first and the second axes that explained the greatest and the second greatest variation of plant-species composition in the DCA analysis, respectively. The AGB model was extrapolated to the stand-age map for the vegetation types between the ages of 1–50 years old. For fallow vegetation older than 50 years, the mean AGB of the two old-fallow stands was uniformly assigned. The DCA axis 1 and axis 2 scores were respectively extrapolated to the stand-age map and an elevation map. The elevation map was derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM-1, 30-m mesh). We removed the areas above 1400 m and below 900 m elevation from the analysis for plant-community composition, because the altitude of inventory plots ranged from 900 m to 1400 m. The estimated DCA axes’ scores were shown as a red/green composite image. Green colors were used to express the gradient of DCA axis 1 scores and red colors were used to express the gradient of DCA axis 2 scores. A base map was produced to reflect the condition as of 22 June 2010, the date when the WorldView-2 multispectral image was taken. Therefore, extrapolated AGB and DCA axis scores reflect the ground patterns as of 22 June 2010.The accuracy of the AGB estimation map was assessed and expressed as a root mean square error (RMSE) determined by comparison between observed vs. estimated AGB values. To determine the RMSE, we used field-observed AGB values of the 12 validation plots and corresponding AGB values estimated from WorldView-2 images. In contrast to the acquisition date of the WorldView-2 in 2010, the validation plots were established in 2014. Therefore, the AGB values of the validation plots were adjusted to the year 2010 for their intermediate growth, using the AGB-stand age (SA) model described above. An estimated AGB within the 11.3 m-radius (400 m2) from the center of each validation plot was compared with the value actually observed. Then, the relationship between estimated and observed values of AGB was derived as a linear regression.", 3. Remote-Sensing Analysis, 3.1.

380,"The total newly cultivated area as of 2010 was 635 ha and the number of newly cultivated parcels was 2660. The current minimum and maximum fallow period was approximately 7 years and 20 years, respectively (estimated from the histogram of the current vegetation pattern [12]). The maximum fallow period was defined as a maximum stand age of vegetation which local people selected to slash and burn. In order to elucidate the influences of different practices of shifting cultivation on the future vegetation and carbon stock, we simulated the vegetation dynamics based on three scenarios, and then evaluated the associated AGB changes. We adopted the following scenarios: (1) ‘reduced-cultivation’ scenario; (2) ‘shorter-fallow’ scenario; and (3) ‘longer-fallow’ scenario. These scenarios were arbitrarily set and all were intended to enhance future carbon stock to meet the government’s strategy. In scenario 1, we assumed that the annual cultivation area would be reduced by one half and the minimum fallow period of shifting cultivation would be kept constant (i.e., 7 years). In scenario 2, the annual cultivation area would be kept constant but, instead, the minimum fallow period of shifting cultivation would be shortened from 7 to 4 years. In scenario 3, the minimum fallow period of shifting cultivation would be elongated from 7 to 10 years while the annual cultivation area would be kept constant. The shorter fallow period in scenario 2 was expected to promote forest succession at a landscape level, with cultivated areas being confined to a more limited area, because shifting cultivation with a shorter fallow period tended to use the same area more intensively and, thus, the rest of the area would escape from slash and burn. The longer fallow in scenario 3 was also expected to promote forest succession and increase total AGB at a stand level without a reduction of cultivation area. Based on the three scenarios, we simulated the dynamics of vegetation patterns and AGB for 10 years from 2010 to 2020, and the results derived were compared with the baseline (i.e., 2010). In the simulations, we assumed that one segment identified by the object-based analysis represented one parcel of vegetation patch (or one parcel of cultivated land), and controlled the number of annually cultivated segments each with a mean area of 3100 m2. The actual segment area varies according to the parcel selected. Therefore, total cultivated area actually slightly varies over the years. Each segment has a stand age as an integer, estimated from the age-estimation algorithm. We controlled two parameters in each simulation: the total number of annually cultivated segments (i.e., annual cultivation area), and the min–max fallow period (i.e., the min–max stand age of the segments which local people select to slash and burn). The min–max fallow period was set as 7–20 years in scenario 1, as 4–20 years in scenario 2, and as 10–40 years in scenario 3. As will be shown, the land available for shifting cultivation actually was not enough in scenario 3 because all of the 10–20-year segments were converted into vegetation younger than 10 years with 4 iterations of the simulation. Therefore, the maximum fallow period of 40 years was used exceptionally in scenario 3 (i.e., local people could cultivate stands as old as 40 years). We estimated the stand age of all segments of the whole study area at one-year intervals from 2010 to 2020 in each simulation. In each year, 1330 segments for scenario 1 (half of the annually cultivated segments in the current state) and 2660 segments for scenarios 2 and 3 were randomly selected from the segments with stand ages between a given min–max fallow period in each simulation. We converted the stand ages of the selected segments into 0 (i.e., the occurrence of annual shifting cultivation), and added 1 to the stand age of the rest of the segments (i.e., annual increment in stand age). This step was iterated for 10 times in each scenario. Subsequently, the AGB stock in 2020 was calculated from the segment ages derived from each simulation. The histograms of segment age and AGB stock in 2020 were compared with those of the current state (as of 2010).", 3. Remote-Sensing Analysis, 3.2. Simulations Using Land-Use Scenarios,3
381,"The results of the AGB estimation as of 2010 are shown in Figure 1. Each pixel in the map contains an AGB value, and the color gradation from red to green indicates a gradient of AGB values from low to high. Vegetation with a medium AGB is densely distributed around the edge of the strictly protected areas (dark green color). On the other hand, lower-AGB vegetation is sparsely distributed over the whole area. Total AGB stock in the total area (15,000 ha) is 1,530,000 Mg (equivalent to 104 Mg ha−1) and total AGB stock in the successional vegetation (1 to 50-year-old vegetation including cultivated area; 9300 ha) is 363,000 Mg (equivalent to 39 Mg ha−1). The relationships between the estimated and observed AGB of 12 validation plots are shown in Figure 2. The RMSE between the estimated and observed AGB was 24.4 Mg ha−1. However, the deviation of the regression line from the 1:1 line suggested an increasing overestimation of AGB in older vegetation. The results of the estimation of plant-community composition are shown in Figure 3. Each pixel in the map shows both DCA axis 1 and DCA axis 2 scores as a red/green spectral composite. Green-color spectrum is used for DCA axis 1 scores and red-color spectrum is used for DCA axis 2 scores. The spectral matrix shows the gradation of the change of composition. The spectral matrix was divided into five species-composition groups according to the category of Fujiki et al. [22]. Most of the area was covered with reddish colors which indicate the herbaceous community. A green color indicates the upper montane short forest community or old-fallow community, and these communities comprise the second largest land-cover component. The area of lower montane short-forest community (yellow color) was relatively small. ", 4. Results, 4.1. AGB Map and Plant-Community Composition Map,4
382,"The results of the simulations based on the three scenarios are shown in Figure 4 in terms of the frequency of vegetation patches (segments) per stand age. The black line indicates the vegetation pattern of the base map as of 2010. The blue line in Figure 4a is the vegetation pattern for the year 2020 based on scenario 1, where the cultivation area was reduced by one half for 10 years. Shifting-cultivation practices based on scenario 1 decreased the frequency of vegetation younger than 7 years and, instead, increased the frequency of vegetation with ages around 15 years. As a result, the total AGB in the successional vegetation (1–50-year-old vegetation including the cultivated area) was increased by 123,000 Mg (equivalent to 13.2 Mg ha−1). Based on scenario 2, in which the minimum fallow period was reduced from 7 to 4 years, the frequency of both vegetation older than 7 years and younger than 4 years increased (Figure 4b). The total AGB in the successional vegetation was increased by 54,000 Mg (equivalent to 5.8 Mg ha−1). On the other hand, the results of scenario 3 showed a different pattern. Based on scenario 3, in which the minimum fallow period was elongated from 7 to 10 years, the simulation could not be continued after four times of iteration with a maximum fallow period of 20 years, as explained earlier. This was because the number of 10–20-year segments became limited for selecting new cultivation areas as all of the 10–20-year segments were converted into vegetation younger than 10 years of age. Therefore, the simulation in Figure 4c was conducted in vegetation with ages up to 40 years. As a result, almost all of the vegetation younger than 40 years was disturbed and converted into vegetation younger than 10 years. The total AGB in the successional vegetation decreased by 72,000 Mg (equivalent to 7.7 Mg ha−1) in this simulation. ", 4. Results, 4.2. Numerical Simulation of Vegetation Patterns Based on Three Scenarios,4
383,"The stand-age map combined with the field-based AGB accumulation model was effective at estimating the AGB of land mosaics of shifting cultivation with secondary vegetation patches at a landscape level (RMSE: 24.4 Mg ha−1). However, as shown in Figure 2, the AGB values were overestimated in the vegetation with higher AGB. This was probably because the identification of patch (segment) boundaries was not successfully undertaken, especially in the vegetation with higher AGB. The segments identified by the object-based analysis were sometimes mixed with the surrounding old-growth vegetation and erroneously regarded as extremely old. Our validation samples were included in such erroneously identified segments, which caused overestimation of vegetation with higher AGB. However, our AGB map is clearly useful for detecting the location and frequency of vegetation patches for a given AGB category. The map of plant-community composition also clearly described the continuous gradients of the community shift in this area by a red/green spectral composite of both DCA axis 1 and DCA axis 2 scores. Most of the study area is covered with a herb community, upper montane short-forest community and old fallow community, whereas the area of lower montane short-forest community is smaller. Fischer et al. [14] suggested that conserving native vegetation alone will not protect ecosystem services, and that land mosaics should include patches of native vegetation, corridors and stepping stones between them, as well as buffers around the native vegetation. Our map can identify the areas of potentially high conservation values, or those with fewer ecosystem services where mitigation measures are required. Such information is useful for the management of corridors and stepping stones between protected areas, and building buffers around them. The stand-age map can be used to predict future vegetation patterns with land-use scenarios. With both scenarios 1 and 2, it is possible to promote forest succession and increase total AGB at a landscape level. Scenario 1 (reducing the cultivation area) is the most effective scenario for promoting forest biomass accumulation and, probably, associated biodiversity. Scenario 2 (fallow reduced from 7 to 4 years, i.e., land-sharing) is also effective at promoting forest biomass accumulation in a landscape. This is because shifting cultivation with a shorter fallow period uses the same area repeatedly, and therefore the rest of the area escapes from slash and burn. Based on scenario 3 (a fallow period elongated from 7 to 10 years, i.e., land-sharing), local people cannot continue shifting cultivation within 4 years because the cultivation area has become saturated. Moreover, the total AGB stock in the successional vegetation is decreased.Past ecological studies reported that shorter fallow periods under shifting cultivation lead to a decrease in species richness and diversity in situ [31,32,33,34]. However, our results suggest that shortening the fallow period of shifting cultivation results in promoting forest succession and increasing total AGB at a landscape level, provided that cultivation becomes intensified in a limited area. On the other hand, elongating the fallow period of shifting cultivation may promote broader deforestation at a landscape level. We suggest that forest dynamics in a whole landscape have to be taken into consideration for predicting the consequences of shifting cultivation.Cultivation practices based on both scenarios 1 and 2 may not be able to maintain cultivation yields. With scenario 1, a reduced cultivation area will directly decrease crop yields if the average crop yield per area is constant. With scenario 2, a shorter fallow can also result in the reduction of crop yield, because intensive land use can decrease availability of soil nutrients such as phosphorus [22,35,36]. Such nutrient reductions and the associated decreases of crop yields indicate the difficulty in maintaining livelihood production with scenario 2. All three scenarios in this study, therefore, may not be able to reconcile livelihood production with forest conservation effectively.In order to reconcile livelihood production with forest conservation, decreased crop yields have to be compensated for through appropriate mechanisms such as REDD+. This is an incentive-based policy mechanism often described as a payment-for-performance system, where people can receive financial support for carbon increments. Our method can provide quantitative information of the current carbon stock as well as expected carbon increments with improved land-use scenarios. Our method can also provide quantitative assessment of how/whether carbon increments can be reconciled with biodiversity conservation because maps derived from our method can elucidate both carbon and plant communities. Once field-based models (i.e., the relationships of stand age with total AGB and plant-community composition) are established in a given area, the same models can be repeatedly applied to different stand-age maps derived from different satellite images to estimate carbon and plant communities at different times. Therefore, our methods are potentially useful for monitoring ecosystem services over time and can contribute to realizing REDD+. ", 5. Discussion,None,5
384,"The functional ability of forest ecosystems to sequester carbon and provide other ecosystem services has been greatly altered by both direct and indirect impacts of climate change over the course of the last decades [1,2,3,4]. International efforts to mitigate global climate change demonstrate both evident progress and significant challenges to overcome due to the complexities of carbon cycle regulation worldwide, as well as substantial uncertainties in the mechanisms of its estimation [5]. The forests of Ukraine, covering nearly 16% of the country’s land area and providing a substantial carbon sink [6], have recently undergone changes and are very likely to face high climate, hydrology, and management-induced risks in the future [7]. Ukraine’s forests are situated in the mid-latitude ecotone, that is, in a transition area between the zone of temperate forests and forestless steppe: e.g., according to the abovementioned study [7], under certain climatic scenarios, a substantial worsening of growth conditions in Ukraine is forecasted by the end of this century mainly due to the water stress. This generates substantial spatial and landscape variability in their features and requires appropriate methods and approaches to account for the current and future vitality and carbon-sequestration capacity of forest ecosystems within the paradigm of adaptive sustainable forest management [8]. Natural disturbances are key drivers that substantially alter the spatio-temporal dynamics of forest ecosystems [9,10,11]: either stand-replacing wildfires, wind breakages and windthrow, or gap-scale insect outbreaks and disease affections. Many recent studies have reported on the exacerbation of disturbance regimes, which are explained by synergism between climate change and an increasing extent in the frequency and severity of natural disturbances [12,13]. An increasing variability of weather conditions results in more frequent and severe heat waves, which substantially escalate the mortality of trees and reduce the productivity of forests [14]. Interactions between different disturbance agents occur more frequently, mostly positively amplifying their negative impacts on ecosystems. Current management systems need to be adapted to already recognized changes in natural disturbance regimes [15]. The forest ecosystems of Ukraine are increasingly disturbed by a number of agents, which are mostly of biogenic origin (outbreaks of insects such as bark beetles and nematode worms; different diseases and pathogens, etc.), but also storms (windbreak and windthrow) and wildfires [16]. Sufficient systematic information on the impact of disturbances on carbon cycling in Ukraine’s forests is still lacking. Although somewhat complete aggregated countrywide estimates of the impacts of disturbances on the carbon budget of forest ecosystems are available, these are mainly related to the effects of harvest and wildfire [6,17]. However, regional analyses on the occurrence, extent and severity of disturbances are rare. For Ukrainian Polissya, the most forested zone in Ukraine’s flatlands, the only publications available to date concern the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone [18,19].Salvage logging continues to have strong ecosystem consequences worldwide [20]. As the almost exclusive harvest method used in the forests of Ukraine’s flatlands, salvage logging is having an uncertain, but mostly negative impact on species diversity, processes of natural afforestation and the lives of local communities [21]. As this method of harvesting involves clear cutting aimed at reducing the risk of wildfires and insects spreading, they simultaneously neglect natural processes of forest dynamics and efforts to maintain biodiversity and other ecosystem functions [9]. To date, salvage and sanitary loggings drive main impact on managed forests after natural mortality events, while natural disturbances as prior reasons for such activities play a substantial role in the shaping of future spatial management composition.While carbon sequestration seems to be the most important ecosystem service provided by forests in terms of climate change mitigation efforts, there is a lack of systematic application of carbon management in Ukraine. Full verified terrestrial carbon accounting is a fuzzy system that requires the complimentary use of different methods for the reliable assessment of uncertainties [5]. Major results obtained in Ukraine are based on a “semi-empirical” landscape-ecosystem approach, combining ground-based assessment with remote sensing data. Other approaches (eddy-covariance method, current generation of process-based models, and inverse modelling) have not been approbated in Ukraine. At the same time, process-based modelling at different scales (both forest landscape and dynamic global vegetation models) remains the only approach for the prediction of future changes in disturbance regimes and their impact on forest ecosystem productivity and services [22]. Studies on the biological productivity of forests are based on empirical methods that endeavor to obtain the most reliable data for past carbon sequestration potential [23]. While allowing the determination of the main carbon pools in ecosystems (live, dead biomass and soil) and some key carbon flows, this approach forms a solid basis for a full and verified accounting of the carbon budget of Ukraine’s forests.The use of remote sensing (RS) data has been proven as a comprehensive tool for the mapping of forest cover, estimation of biomass, determining tree species distribution, and the assessment of past forest dynamics [24,25,26]. Using the common non-parametric methods Random Forest (RF) (as a processing application for the land cover classification of satellite imagery) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) (as a modelling system for the determination and calculation of forest parameters) provide strict, explicit, and reliable data on forest vegetation cover, live biomass and their parameters [27,28,29,30]. A number of studies based on remote sensing data assessed major natural disturbance agents across North America and reported large forest patches influenced by wildfires, windthrows and bark beetle outbreaks [31,32]. Meanwhile, European studies that focused on wind and bark beetle disturbances with smaller occurrence and severity, considered Landsat time series a reliable tool capable of assessing the disturbance agents mentioned above at 76%–86% precision in protected and actively managed stands [33,34]. Characterizing disturbances in forest ecosystems using satellite images has been proved to be successful tool for monitoring forest changes. Although dense time series of remote sensing data have been extensively used, a bi-temporal approach for the detection of disturbances is more preferential for use with commercial satellite images.One of the background principles of transition to adaptive, risk resilient forest management in a changing world is a continuous monitoring of the state and dynamics of forest ecosystems with prompt application of new emerging knowledge of forest management practices. Such monitoring should be provided at different scales among which empirical studies at landscape level seem to be underestimated. A major objective of this research is to assess the carbon budget of forest ecosystems based on a relatively small experimental area over a 5-year period, using available ground and RS data. The study focused on ascertaining the role of natural and anthropogenic disturbances in the region with rapid changes of land cover and considers the influence of spatial and temporal peculiarities of data and methods on the reliability of the results. This requires carrying out a comparative analysis of different sources of available information and major agents that have influenced the local dynamics of forests over a short period.Here we aim (i) to identify main typical disturbances in forest ecosystems of Ukrainian Polissya using ground-based inventory and remote sensing data; (ii) to assess impact of disturbances on carbon cycle and encompass links between natural and anthropogenic disturbances; (iii) to develop models and define impact of dead biomass decomposition on forest carbon cycle.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
385,"The experimental polygon is located in the Chernihiv region between longitudes 31° 47′ 2″ E and 31° 52′ 60″ E and latitudes 52° 1′ 57″ N and 52° 5′ 31″ N (Northern Ukraine, Ukrainian Polissya zone), and covers an area of 45 km2. Forest ecosystems, which covered 38.8% of the polygon area in 2010, comprised mostly Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), silver birch (Betula pendula L.) and black alder (Alnus glutinosa L.)—respectively representing 44.7%, 39.8%, and 13.1% of the tree species dominance. Common aspen (Populus tremula L.) and other softwood broadleaved tree species dominate on a small area (~2.4%). Only 16% of local forest stands are mixed, 31% is a share of forests with admixtures of other tree species (less than 20% in stand tree composition), the rest is presented by stands with only one predominant tree species. Mixed stands are formed by combinations of all local common tree species. The experimental site represents a typical tree species composition for Ukrainian Polissya. A detailed description of the landscape, forest productivity and age distribution characteristics of vegetation was presented in Bilous et al. (2017) [30]. A distinct feature of the research area is the presence of continuous changes in land cover due to the natural afforestation of abandoned agricultural lands and illegal cutting by local people in shelterbelts within agricultural landscapes and forest stands on agricultural land. Forests per se are managed by a number of stakeholders (who are subordinate to the state forest authority) and are actively managed. Changes in forest cover may be very rapid: for example, areas affected by outbreaks of bark beetles, storms or wildfires, as a rule, are immediately cleared with salvage (sanitary) logging. The distribution of land cover classes within the study area during the years 2010–2015 is presented in Table 1.The occurrence of natural disturbance events across the experimental polygon was examined on a 5-year temporal scale (2010–2015). A large storm damaged forests on an area of 32.8 ha in the southern part of the study site in 2013, causing wind breakage in mostly pine and birch stands. Outbreaks of pests were observed throughout the polygon in 2010 and 2014, being caused by European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus L.). In 2015, large fires occurred in the northeastern part of the polygon and some burned areas remained unmanaged during the above period, while the rest was cleared with salvage logging. Thus, the spatio-temporal structure of the research site represents a typical forest disturbance regime for Ukrainian Polissya [16].", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.1. Study Area,2
386," 2.2.1. Remote Sensing Data and Ancillary DataRemote sensing data for the study site included the following satellite images: RapidEye (acquisition date July 1, 2010; spectral bands used: B1—blue, B2—green, B3—red, B4—redEdge, B5—NIR4; spatial resolution—5 m); SPOT 6 (acquisition date August 9, 2015; spectral bands used: B1—blue, B2—green, B3—red, B4—NIR; spatial resolution—6 m); IKONOS (acquisition date August 12, 2011; resolution after pan-sharpening—0.81 m). All images have been acquired from data providers by end-user license agreements: BlackBridge, Airbus DS, and DigitalGlobe. We have chosen the images of 5–6 m spatial resolution since they enable effective mapping of forest disturbances within the study area and meet the requirements of national forest inventory guidelines regarding the size of minimal mapping unit of 0.5 ha. Spectral bands of multispectral images have been converted to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance. RapidEye and SPOT 6 images were employed in the study for per-pixel classification, while IKONOS image was used as a source for training data collection. To improve the visual interpretation of IKONOS data, we applied the pan-sharpening technique for enhancing its spatial resolution up to 0.81 m. For geometrical correction of the images, we used rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) provided with data. Afterwards both RapidEye and SPOT 6 images were co-registered to IKONOS image which had higher spatial accuracy.As a source of ancillary information, we employed digital elevation model (DEM) featuring a 10 m resolution and a vector layer which comprised polygons with soil types features within the study area. To match all components of the raster dataset, the DEM and RapidEye image were finally projected to a 6 m spatial resolution. 2.2.2. Reference DataThe sampling frame for image classification was created following a recommendation by Olofsson et al. [35] using a stratified sampling design. We used Global Forest Change dataset [36] for the stratification of the study area into four strata: permanent forest—forested area with canopy cover of 40% and more; non-forest areas; forest loss—defined as change from a forest to a non-forest state that occurred during the study period; and forest gain, which is defined as an opposite process to loss. The minimum sampling size for every stratum accounted for as much as 50 sampling points. All 568 sampling points were visually classified using IKONOS imagery as a reference. We applied a two-tier classification scheme representing the major land classes (LC) of the research area: croplands (263); forested area (246); shrublands (32); wetlands (9); and water bodies (19).The second tier included a detailed classification of the forested area by dominant tree species. We used the forest inventory database (FID) to filter forest stands composed of a single species. Afterwards we selected about 150 random points within these stands (Table 2). This step was important to exclude the mixed pixels problem from further analysis [37]. For each sampling point we extracted a median pixel within a radius of r = 12.62 m, which is a usual sample size for forest inventory in Ukraine. The quality of the FID was crucial for our study because it was used as a reference dataset for prediction of carbon stock using satellite images. Three state forest enterprises whose forests are located within the boundaries of the research area were inventoried between three and seven years prior to our study. It was unclear if the inventory data corresponded to the current state of the forest cover. In addition, there was no information about forests outside areas managed by the state forest authority. In order to update and clarify the features of land cover, we conducted our own stand level inventory within the experimental polygon, regardless of its affiliation to local forest enterprises. The in-situ inventory was carried out according to the main requirements as set out in the existing Ukraine forest inventory manuals. During field inventory a qualified crew has inspected each forest stand and measured their main parameters: quadratic mean diameter, stand height, age, site index, relative stocking, and tree species composition. The mean stand parameters have been estimated by measuring diameters and heights of 3–5 sample trees within each forest polygon. For immature, mature, and overmature stands basal area has been calculated using circular (r = 12.62 m) and angle-counting plots (basal area factor 1). The selection of plot configuration depended on structure of a stand. For example, if a dense undergrowth was present in a stand making impossible to apply a relascope for tree counting, then fixed-radius plots were established. The number of sample plots (usually 3–7) has been estimated following the national forest inventory guidelines and depended on peculiarities of age, spatial structure and area of forest stand in question.The purpose of the described inventory was twofold: (i) to clarify the boundaries of inventory units; and (ii) to precisely estimate forest stand biometrical parameters that are further used for satellite image classification. Thus, the training dataset for modelling the spatial distribution of carbon and net primary production (NPP) was created using FID and median pixel values for the forest stands selected above. We aggregated all pixels inside polygons to calculate the median values. The training datasets were collected separately for the years 2010 and 2015 using the RapidEye and SPOT 6 images. 2.2.3. Dataset for Biomass EstimationThe experimental data on forest dead biomass were collected at temporary sample plots (TSPs), which were established in accordance with the methodology proposed by Bilous (2014) [17]. TSPs are demarcated on site in accordance with the relevant national requirements for forest inventory sample plots. The size of a sample plot is defined based on the number of trees of the target species (usually not less than 200–250 trees for middle-aged and mature stands and 350–500 for young stands). The size of a TSP typically ranges from 0.05 to 1.00 ha. Diameter at breast height is measured for every tree. A total of 5–15 sample trees are selected proportionally to diameter class distribution. The sample trees are cut, based on their heights a height curve is further produced. Simultaneously, the following measurements are carried out: stem length from stump to top; height of stump; length of branch-free section of the stem; stem height at which the first live branch is attached, tree age, 5-year height increment of a tree, bark thickness and 5-year diameter increment at stump height, breast height (1.3 m), and at the middle of stem sections. For each sample tree dead branches are weighed. Snags were surveyed with measuring DBH, height, and identification of coarse and fine branches presence. Length and diameter on middle of length were measured in logs samplings, also presence of branches on downed stems was identified. Compartments of coarse woody debris (CWD) were determined by decomposition stage: snags (I-II classes), logs and coarse branches litter (I-V classes). Coarse branches litter and fine litter were assessed on sample plots. The biomass samples are further processed in a laboratory aiming at establishing density of the dead biomass components.83 temporary sample plots were established in Ukrainian Polissya region with aim to model forest dead biomass, including 22 TSPs within the study polygon (5 in pine, 5 in birch, 5 in alder, and 7 in aspen stands). Additionally, we used data from 45 sample plots presented in Lakyda and Matushevych, 2006 [38].These TSPs were used to assess the dry weight of dead biomass including snags, logs, coarse branches litter and fine litter (t d.m.·ha−1), see Table 3. The applied classification and definitions of the dead biomass components are presented in Table 4.The dead biomass of tree and shrub roots was not assessed due to the large uncertainty associated with the identification of different decomposition stages (dead roots versus decomposed soil organic matter). The total aboveground dead biomass of the experimental polygon’s forests was computed as the sum of snags, logs, coarse branches and fine litter. 2.2.4. Data on Heterotrophic Soil RespirationSoil carbon stock (for the stock-based method) and heterotrophic soil respiration (HSR) (for the flux-based method) were obtained based on the database of Mukhortova et al. [39]. Of the nine main soil groups typical for the forest ecosystems of Eurasia, only three were found among the soil types of the experimental polygon (Table 5).", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.2.

As an alternative, estimated C and NPP values were compared to data obtained from satellite images. The forest mask was created through classification of images using the RF method, while NPP and C values were predicted within the mask by means of the k-NN method. Since these maps are of raster type, assessment of the mean values for fluxes and stocks has been carried out based on the pixel values.

392," 2.4.1. Image Classification ApproachesWe used a Random Forest classifier to classify images. We used the following variables as predictors in the LC classifications: X and Y coordinates, DEM, and spectral bands. The out-of-bag error for the forest mask was about 2%. There are two sources of commission and omission errors, namely shrublands and orchards, that have spectral features similar to those of forests. The confusion in terms of tree species classification is larger, so we included the ground forest type as an additional predictor variable. This helped us to distinguish black alder more precisely. The total accuracy of tree species classification was 13%.We used %IncMSE as a measure of variable importance for tree species classification. Among spectral data, red, red edge and near-infrared bands were the most important variables (Figure 1 and Figure S1), while those from a non-spectral features list represents DEM and soil type. As was expected, coordinates X and Y did not play a significant role in tree species classification. As can be seen in Figure 1, coniferous and deciduous forests are distinguished quite well. The major confusion occurs between black alder and silver birch that have similar spectral signals in visible and infra-red bands. We included the soil type layer to improve our classification (Figure 2 and Figure S2). The forested area lies within eight soil types that could be grouped in two major classes: Luvisols and Greyzems (soil types 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 133, 162; [39]) and Hystosols (soil type 138). Figure 2 demonstrates that black alder mainly occupies over wetted organic soils (Hystosols), while silver birch never occurs there. To predict the spatial distribution of carbon stock and NPP at pixel basis we used the k-NN technique available from the yaImpute package for R [40]. Spectral bands and DEM were selected as predictors. We analyzed all available distance metrics (Euclidean, Mahalanobis, Most Similar Neighbor, Gradient Nearest Neighbor, Individual Component Analysis) and selected Random Forest as a method for the nearest neighbor search since it was more precise. We imputed carbon and NPP values for each pixel of RapidEye and SPOT 6 images using the corresponding training datasets for 2010 and 2015. The imputation was performed strictly within the forest masks.The spatial accuracy of forest masks for 2010 and 2015 was estimated using an error matrix of land cover classification (Table 6 and Table 7). We used out-of-bag (OOB) samples as implemented in the RF classifier to assess the misclassification between reference and predicted land cover classes. The OOB error rate of 12.5% proved that SPOT-based classification of land cover outperformed RapidEye classification by more than 16% of the OOB error. The user accuracy of forest cover classification for both epochs reached 97%–98%.The total accuracy of the tree species classification is significantly lower and estimated as high as 78% for both 2010 and 2015. The major source of misclassification is caused by three tree species that cover a relatively small area within the study polygon (aspen, oak, and black locust). 2.4.2. Carbon Budget EstimationAiming to estimate carbon flows, we applied the methodology of full verified carbon accounting developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, [5]). Using both stock-based and flux-based methods, we examined the available data from the ground-based surveys on the sample plots and FID, as well as the dataset presented by Mukhortova et al. [39] for soil carbon stock and heterotrophic respiration estimation. Classic methods of statistics and error theory were used for calculation of the main parameters of output results of carbon budgets and fluxes. The uncertainty of indirect measurements was estimated at a probability of 68% (±SD).The stock-based method is defined as:

where ΔC is the annual change of organic carbon in forest ecosystems, while ΔLB, ΔWD, and ΔS respectively represents changes of C stocks in live biomass, woody detritus and soil. The method of dead biomass estimation in Ukraine proposed by Bilous [1] is a modification of Harmon et al. [41]. This approach defines coarse woody debris (CWD) as snags (standing dead stems and dead branches on live and dead trees), logs (fallen stems and stumps) and coarse branches (d > 1 cm) litter, while other dead biomass components (fine litter of fine branches (d ≤ 1 cm), fruits and foliage, and dead roots) are considered part of soil carbon stock.The flux-based method can be defined as:

where NBP and NPP represents net biome and net primary production respectively, HSR is heterotrophic soil respiration, DIST is the loss caused by natural and anthropogenic disturbances, LAT is lateral fluxes into the lithosphere and hydrosphere, and DEC is carbon loss caused by the decomposition of woody detritus. Carbon fluxes related to harvest and natural disturbances are jointly accounted for due to the above-mentioned clearing of post-disturbance areas by salvage logging (except for young stands after wildfires). LAT flux due to the actual absence of respective data was calculated using the same assumption proposed by Shvidenko et al. [16] for Ukraine, being given as 5% of NPP flux for study area.For live biomass estimation (birch, alder, and aspen) we used equations proposed by Bilous et al. [30], which include stems over bark, branches, foliage, understory and green forest floor. Belowground live biomass was defined using models presented in Shvidenko et al. [42]. All the equations used include stand age, site index and relative stocking as independent variables. Dead biomass by components were calculated using Equations (3)–(5):

In order to estimate the decomposition rate, we collected 317 samples of CWD of birch, alder, aspen, and oak. Of these, 153 were between 1 and 10 cm in diameter, and 164 had a diameter of more than 10 cm at different stages of decay. For each CWD sample, diameter and density were measured in dry conditions, given that the dates of the respective tree deaths were known.The decomposition rate of CWD was assessed using the chronosequence method [43]:

where Pt is the density of CWD remaining at time t (years), P0 is the initial density, and k is the average annual constant of the decomposition rate independent on the climatic conditions (year−1). Decomposition rates for birch, alder, aspen and oak are presented in Appendix A. The decomposition rate of snags for all other tree species was taken at 0.03 year−1, and for logs of Scots pine at 0.06 year−1 according to Shvidenko et al. [16].NPP was accounted for using a semi-empirical method described in Shvidenko et al. [42]. In this method, NPP is considered to be the difference of total productivity of live biomass for two consecutive years, taking into account the turnover of fine roots and foliage, as well as damage by wind, insects, harvest, etc. Contrary to the direct aggregation of field measurements, this method does not have any recognized biases. The uncertainty of NPP was defined independently through a correlation between the current increment of live biomass and NPP.As a rule, insect outbreaks and wind damage cause relatively small impacts on biomass stock, converting a part of live biomass into dead organic matter and decreasing the biological productivity of the remaining over- and understory [9]. Such natural disturbances were observed in the study area for the considered time period, however, the disturbed sites are usually cleared with removal of all biomass except for underground live and dead components. Fires that occurred on the polygon area were observed in three stands, including a complete aboveground biomass loss due to high-severity burning in young pine forests (two stands, with a few snag remnants) and was cleared by salvage logging the site of the third stand. Hence, all the natural disturbances in this study were considered a net total loss of entire accumulated aboveground biomass, which was similar to our calculations for harvested forest stands.", 2.

393,"We used a Random Forest classifier to classify images. We used the following variables as predictors in the LC classifications: X and Y coordinates, DEM, and spectral bands. The out-of-bag error for the forest mask was about 2%. There are two sources of commission and omission errors, namely shrublands and orchards, that have spectral features similar to those of forests. The confusion in terms of tree species classification is larger, so we included the ground forest type as an additional predictor variable. This helped us to distinguish black alder more precisely. The total accuracy of tree species classification was 13%.We used %IncMSE as a measure of variable importance for tree species classification. Among spectral data, red, red edge and near-infrared bands were the most important variables (Figure 1 and Figure S1), while those from a non-spectral features list represents DEM and soil type. As was expected, coordinates X and Y did not play a significant role in tree species classification. As can be seen in Figure 1, coniferous and deciduous forests are distinguished quite well. The major confusion occurs between black alder and silver birch that have similar spectral signals in visible and infra-red bands. We included the soil type layer to improve our classification (Figure 2 and Figure S2). The forested area lies within eight soil types that could be grouped in two major classes: Luvisols and Greyzems (soil types 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, 133, 162; [39]) and Hystosols (soil type 138). Figure 2 demonstrates that black alder mainly occupies over wetted organic soils (Hystosols), while silver birch never occurs there. To predict the spatial distribution of carbon stock and NPP at pixel basis we used the k-NN technique available from the yaImpute package for R [40]. Spectral bands and DEM were selected as predictors. We analyzed all available distance metrics (Euclidean, Mahalanobis, Most Similar Neighbor, Gradient Nearest Neighbor, Individual Component Analysis) and selected Random Forest as a method for the nearest neighbor search since it was more precise. We imputed carbon and NPP values for each pixel of RapidEye and SPOT 6 images using the corresponding training datasets for 2010 and 2015. The imputation was performed strictly within the forest masks.The spatial accuracy of forest masks for 2010 and 2015 was estimated using an error matrix of land cover classification (Table 6 and Table 7). We used out-of-bag (OOB) samples as implemented in the RF classifier to assess the misclassification between reference and predicted land cover classes. The OOB error rate of 12.5% proved that SPOT-based classification of land cover outperformed RapidEye classification by more than 16% of the OOB error. The user accuracy of forest cover classification for both epochs reached 97%–98%.The total accuracy of the tree species classification is significantly lower and estimated as high as 78% for both 2010 and 2015. The major source of misclassification is caused by three tree species that cover a relatively small area within the study polygon (aspen, oak, and black locust).", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.4.1.

394,"Aiming to estimate carbon flows, we applied the methodology of full verified carbon accounting developed by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA, [5]). Using both stock-based and flux-based methods, we examined the available data from the ground-based surveys on the sample plots and FID, as well as the dataset presented by Mukhortova et al. [39] for soil carbon stock and heterotrophic respiration estimation. Classic methods of statistics and error theory were used for calculation of the main parameters of output results of carbon budgets and fluxes.

where ΔC is the annual change of organic carbon in forest ecosystems, while ΔLB, ΔWD, and ΔS respectively represents changes of C stocks in live biomass, woody detritus and soil. The method of dead biomass estimation in Ukraine proposed by Bilous [1] is a modification of Harmon et al. [41]. This approach defines coarse woody debris (CWD) as snags (standing dead stems and dead branches on live and dead trees), logs (fallen stems and stumps) and coarse branches (d > 1 cm) litter, while other dead biomass components (fine litter of fine branches (d ≤ 1 cm), fruits and foliage, and dead roots) are considered part of soil carbon stock.The flux-based method can be defined as:

where NBP and NPP represents net biome and net primary production respectively, HSR is heterotrophic soil respiration, DIST is the loss caused by natural and anthropogenic disturbances, LAT is lateral fluxes into the lithosphere and hydrosphere, and DEC is carbon loss caused by the decomposition of woody detritus. Carbon fluxes related to harvest and natural disturbances are jointly accounted for due to the above-mentioned clearing of post-disturbance areas by salvage logging (except for young stands after wildfires). LAT flux due to the actual absence of respective data was calculated using the same assumption proposed by Shvidenko et al. [16] for Ukraine, being given as 5% of NPP flux for study area.For live biomass estimation (birch, alder, and aspen) we used equations proposed by Bilous et al. [30], which include stems over bark, branches, foliage, understory and green forest floor. Belowground live biomass was defined using models presented in Shvidenko et al. [42]. All the equations used include stand age, site index and relative stocking as independent variables. Dead biomass by components were calculated using Equations (3)–(5):

395,"FID showed a slight decrease in the area covered by pine (commonly harvested for timber production) and a corresponding increase in birch-dominated stands (as a pioneer species encroaching abandoned agricultural sites), while the area dominated by alder, which prefers wetter soils with a thin (<30 cm) peat layer, has not actually changed. C stock has slightly increased for all main species indicated by FID but has shown great fluctuations in RS estimates as well as in pine-dominated forests (Table 8, Figure 3).Forest gain (Appendix A, Figure S5) is observed on abandoned agricultural lands as well as on clear-cuts, since regeneration was established before 2010. Young stands on abandoned agricultural lands are characterized by intensive tree growth and increasing biodiversity [44].Forest loss (Table 9) is identified within forested areas disturbed by natural agents (a wildfire in the north-east, a wind breakage in the south-west and insect outbreaks throughout the polygon) that have been consecutively cleared by salvage logging, as well as by stands harvested for timber production or as a result of illegal logging in forests of different subordination. A comparison of outputs demonstrates the opposite results: the increase of net forested area according to RS data is 5.6 times larger than the respective loss obtained from FID. Carbon stock calculation results show a considerable variation from net loss to net gain according to field inventory and remote sensing data.The same trends are recognized for NPP estimates (Table 10, Figure 4 and Figure S6).", 3. Results," 3.1. Forest Mask, Carbon Stock, and NPP",3
396,"Soils, including fine litter, store the largest amount of C. Estimates of C stock strictly depend on the size of the forested area, which was much larger for RS data, leading to a substantial increase of total C stock in soils and live biomass (Table 11). On the other hand, since a change of forested area on abandoned agricultural sites was not accounted for by FID, the calculated soil C stock has slightly decreased, resulting in a high discrepancy (~20 times) between the two stock-based outputs obtained by different methods.Dead biomass (including CWD and fine litter) on average account for 13.0% of the total C in forest biomass within the study area, with a 41.5% C share of woody debris (Appendix A, Figure S7). The percentage of belowground live biomass is slightly higher (16.9%) while green forest floor and understory both represent around 3.0% of the total biomass stock. Apparently, local C stock is concentrated in stem over bark (58.2%) compartment, while foliage and live branches account for 8.9% of C stock.HSR fluxes were strictly related to the size of the forested area, while the resulting DEC were dependent on stored woody debris. The discrepancy between FID and RS data computed using the flux-based method was insignificant, specifically in comparison to the respective values obtained using the stock-based method (Table 12).All fluxes except DIST are presented as annual values for 2010 or 2015, while losses caused by disturbances and harvest were computed for the entire study period. Overall, the results of the NPP assessment obtained from FID and RS data are consistent. However, the RS data addresses a stronger trend of increasing NPP. This may be explained by a more flexible NPP estimation for each RS imagery pixel compared to a rougher stand-wise assessment.RS data showed less C loss caused by disturbances, since this method estimates the forest cover area more flexibly, while FID is typically based on a polygonal approach.The temporal composition across disturbance agents and gain by area/carbon change, being based on annual forest inventory data on replanting and salvage/sanitary loggings that have occurred within study period, is presented in Figure 5 and Figure S8.Values for 2010 and for 2015 are presented for July 31, 2010 and 2015, respectively.The increase in forested area follows from the transformation of previously unforested area to forests (after a reforestation phase reaches the 5-year mark), explains the substantially lower respective C values. A similar situation is observed on burned areas as a result of the disturbance followed by salvage logging, particularly in young stands. Harvest, however, remains the primary cause of C and forested area loss. At the same time, an intensive storm event in 2013 actually converted the entire experimental polygon from a net C sink to a net C source causing ~2 Gg C emissions (Figure 5 and Figure S8).", 3.

397,"The observed and estimated values of total carbon stock show substantial variability but on average, they are well agreed with the 1:1 line (Figure 6 and Figure S9). The per-pixel distribution of NPP values for 2015 were compared using the regional map compiled by Lesiv et al. [6] with a spatial resolution of 40 × 60 m (Figure 7 and Figure S10). Although the compared maps have different spatial accuracy, we can conclude that the regional map performed well for such a small area. We compared the mean values of NPP estimates—4.9 Mg C·ha−1·year−1 according to the map presented in Lesiv et al. [6], while our estimate is 4.8 Mg C·ha−1·year−1.We applied the lossyear layer of the GFC dataset [36] to calculate forest loss that occurred within the study area during 2011–2015 (Figure 8 and Figure S11). The global forest change map underestimates the area of forest loss. Although, the loss layers of this research and GFC have a rather good agreement—the total GFC loss is nearly 60 ha while, according to our assessment, it is 137 ha, which is explained by the rough spatial resolution of GFC data.GFC data does not provide information about an annual forest gain but it includes a cumulative area that has been converted from non-forested into forested during the period from 2000 to 2015. For the study period, about 314 ha of forest gain is identified by GFC. We classified about 318 ha of forest gain for the same period.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Spatial Accuracy and Reliability,4
398,"Ukraine still does not have an effective enough forest inventory and management system capable of meeting global change challenges. In total, 7.5% of Ukrainian forests are not officially subordinated to any entity [45]. The last aggregated forest inventory data for Ukraine was reported in 2011, while a countrywide national forest inventory has not been carried out yet [45]. In addition, rapid changes in land cover induce additional uncertainties. This situation is clearly illustrated by the research polygon. According to FID the percentage of forest cover there was 40.7% in 2015. However, according to our surveys, forests of state enterprises in the region only account for 26.5%, while the remaining forest cover consisted of young forests under natural succession processes on former agricultural lands, which had not been used for the preceding 20–30 years. During 2010–2015 there was an active regrowth of trees and shrubs on abandoned agricultural lands [29].However, a simultaneous deforestation process took place there. Aiming to reclaim land for agricultural use, trees and stands were cut on an area of about 200–250 ha. Note that this land was not indicated as forest in 2010. The natural regrowth on those sites was at canopy closure stage (turning into forest as land cover class) in 2011–2012, the majority of it was harvested (occasionally being burned) in 2013–2014 and the territories were prepared for crop planting. Such forests were not indicated in either FID or RS data in 2010 and 2015.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Forest Land Cover and Carbon Estimation,4
399,"The extent, frequency, and severity of individual natural disturbances like wildfires, wind damage, and bark beetle outbreaks in the study region have a very uneven temporal distribution. This unevenness is substantially amplified by post-disturbance forest management activities. For instance, practically all stands affected by bark beetles are cleared by salvage logging. As a result, these stands become agents of biomass and C loss. Only a few forested areas damaged by insects and diseases were found in the study area during the 5-year period. Note that the spatial structure of forest cover may play a substantial role in the distribution of disturbances and carbon fluxes. For instance, young stands of silver birch serve as a buffer zone that restricts the spreading of bark beetles that actively damage Scots pine stands [46]. An intense storm event in 2013 destroyed forests over 32.8 ha (~1.8% of forested area) of the research polygon and made them a net C source for this year (considering C budget of forested areas within polygons and its C fluxes), in spite of the forest gain and increasing productivity of existing stands. Information about wood lateral flow in the region is lacking or unreliable. Therefore, the substitutional effect of sanitary (salvage) logging on the C cycle cannot be estimated precisely in the study region. On the other hand, timber obtained from such harvesting in Ukraine is basically used as fuel. Consequently, biomass removal caused by wind breakages and insect outbreaks (where all plots were cleared) was estimated as a net C loss. Comparing to studies with similar geographic, climatic, and hydrological conditions and tree species compositions, we can call for resent study from Polish forests [47]. There was a data on severe wind breakages that had removed .ca half of stand basal area in forests of Scots pine, Silver birch and Black alder. However, post-disturbance ecosystems not affected by salvage loggings created more structurally diverse stands with better maintaining the habitats preservation function.Different post-disturbance forest management actions may also play a substantial role. Forests within the study area are subordinated to three state or communal authorities, however, clear cuts were carried out after outbreaks of pests or diseases only in one enterprise. In two others, selective sanitary cuts that caused smaller carbon emissions were carried out. Such case may refer to situation occurred in post-soviet countries of Eastern Europe without long history of non-state forestry: e.g., in Poland private forests faced much more frequent natural disturbances, which can correspond to lower ecosystem resilience entailed by inappropriate management practices [48].Therefore, local disturbances are mainly linked to human factor, while natural events serve as preliminary reasons for either salvage or sanitary loggings in stands of all age cohorts starting from middle-aged forests. However, Ukrainian forests planted in second part of XX century remain to be ecosystems with low resilience capacity [7], so thus needing human intervention after prior mortality events with aim to prevent risks related to further occurrence and spreading of bark beetles and diseases. So we are therefore convinced that for such cases the composition of natural disturbances that caused obliged human silvicultural activities like salvage logging must be determined. Another question is how loggings after natural disturbances with such intensity and actual absence of natural concerns affect local biodiversity and ecosystem functioning [49].In general, consideration of regional specifics increases the reliability of estimates of carbon cycling in forest ecosystems. However, some limitations remain. Some changes in land and forest cover occur so rapidly that they cannot be properly quantified, even over short time periods. In addition, unrecognized biases could be generated due to the fact that regional models and empirical aggregations applied within this research, are inevitably based on limited experimental data collected on a restricted number of sample plots. Summing up, we state that natural and anthropogenic disturbances caused nearly 21% of total C emissions from forest ecosystems in the study area from 2010 to 2015, including 57% due to timber harvest and 34% due to wind damage, while 6% resulted from insect outbreaks and 3% from wildfires. The persistence of this kind of distribution is very unlikely due to the substantial impacts of rare disturbances of large magnitude (e.g., wind damage or a fire that occurred during the study period).", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Disturbances Impact,4
400,"Some lessons follow from this study. Official forest inventory data in Ukraine are not capable of properly reflecting the short period dynamics of forests. There are two major reasons for this, namely, the incompleteness of territorial coverage and the impossibility of accounting for rapid (1 to 3 years) changes in land cover. This generates a bias of unknown direction and magnitude. Carbon emissions caused by insects and diseases are substantially dependent on forest management similarity and appropriateness (e.g., selective harvest versus clear cutting). Inappropriate forest management (e.g., unreasonable clear cuts in stands affected by biogenic agents) usually increases carbon emissions. The impacts of disturbances like harvest and insect outbreaks are the major drivers of forest cover dynamics in Ukrainian Polissya. Rapid changes in land and forest cover are an inherent feature of this most forested region of the country’s flatlands. This also greatly influences the functions and services of forest ecosystems, particularly their carbon cycle. Wildfires and storms may also have a substantial impact on carbon emissions. However, the extent, frequency, and severity of these disturbance agents are not systematic on a local spatial and short temporal scale. Overall, this study raises some questions about the scaling aspects of a full verified carbon account of forest ecosystems. The most pressing of these are, how regional changes occurring at temporal and spatial scales that are impossible to properly monitor by large territorial assessments impact the reliability of aggregated (country-wide) estimates, and how uncertainties originating from these kinds of inconsistencies can be optimally minimized.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
401,"Controlling and managing above-ground vegetation has crucial importance in studies related to reducing carbon emissions [1] or associated with deforestation and forest degradation [2]. Both effects are increased by wildland fires and progressive abandonment of farming lands [3,4]. Biomass is a key structural variable in all the studies about ecosystem dynamics, biodiversity, and sustainability [3,5,6]. For example, maps of forest fuel were obtained by [7], and the spatiotemporal evolution of the risk of forest fire using landsat satellite imagery was studied by [8]. The dynamics of the biomass structure were analysed by [9] and related to different stages of flammability. According to [4,10], the importance of shrublands in the Mediterranean ecosystem is very high due to their significance in the forest dynamic and the large swathe of territory occupied, but most of the studies carried out in the literature are about the biomass of tree species [11,12,13]. Biomass estimation in a forest environment can be undertaken in a direct way by harvesting and weighing sampled plant material [14] or indirectly by measuring morphological variables and applying mathematical models. The first method generates more accurate estimations but is more time-consuming, while the second is indicated for multitemporal studies. A mixed model consists of harvesting a sample of plant material and calibrating the mathematical model using the collected data [4,9]. Phytovolume is the volume under vegetal canopy, while biomass represents the weight of the aerial part of the vegetation. The relationship between biomass and phytovolume using apparent density was applied by [15] for indirect estimation of biomass, demonstrating that phytovolume is a good estimator of biomass with regression coefficients of up to 90%. Species were characterised by their apparent density and biomass ratio, which were modelled through regressions between phytovolume and biomass. In another study, model regressions were characterised between biomass and phytovolume for 16 Mediterranean shrub species divided into five density classes [16]. Phytovolume was used by [17] for demonstrating significant differences between two management systems, grazing and not-grazing, with respect to the flammability of forest resources.Instead of harvested plant material, aerial data have been widely used for indirect measurement in the literature, including optical, SAR, LiDAR, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data-based methods with the empirical radiative transfer model, machine learning algorithms, and artificial intelligence. Artificial neural network (ANN) models incorporating radar data performed better in estimating phytomass than ANN models, using only optical vegetation indices with r-squared values of 0.79 and 0.6, respectively [18]. Other studies centred on multispectral satellite imagery were carried out by [19], who used height and diameter data and a classification of cover fraction based on Quickbird and Landsat imagery for mapping fuel type. A comparison of eight spectral indices of vegetation based on MODIS imagery for fire prediction purposes was undertaken by [20].LiDAR point cloud information and multispectral imagery were combined to obtain fuel maps with up to 85.43% global agreement, using object-based image analysis (OBIA) [7]. The height of the canopy was measured with LiDAR and hyperspectral sensors by [15] for adjusting regressions to biomass. The same source of data was used by [6] for obtaining biomass and stress maps. A complete review of the accuracies obtained in biomass estimations based on LiDAR data by different authors can be read in [3].Biomass was monitored by [21] using P-band SAR with multitemporal observations, concluding that P-bands are the most suited frequency for above-ground biomass of boreal forests; multitemporal satellite imagery and SAR data were combined by [22] for above-ground biomass estimation reaching an adjusted R2 of 0.43 and RMSE of around 70 Mg/ha; and above-ground biomass was estimated by [23,24] from UAV data at a different scale levels, obtaining correlations of r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 344 g/m2 and r2 = 0.98, RMSE = 91.48 g/m2, respectively.Phytovolume can be obtained by taking the difference between the digital surface model (DSM), which involves the canopy and base soil between vegetation clusters, and the digital terrain model (DTM), which covers the terrain surface without vegetation [25].The Mediterranean shrubland has low-lying vegetation with a relatively high fractional vegetation cover (FVC) [5,17]. These characteristics compromise the phytovolume modelling for two main reasons: The point clouds obtained from photogrammetric methods, radar, or LiDAR, have a low density of points located at the bare soil, and the radiometric methods based on multispectral imagery classification tend to underestimate the phytovolume due to the difficulty of dead vegetation detection.With the recent development of civilian use of UAVs, a large variety of sensors with the capacity for close-range sensing has been applied in environmental engineering in general and for monitoring specific ecosystem variables [26,27,28]. Digital cameras operating in the visible spectrum are used for UAV-photogrammetric projects combined with the structure from motion (SfM) [29] and multi-view stereopsis (MVS) [30] techniques, producing very high-resolution orthoimages, DSMs, DTMs, and very dense point clouds of the terrain [31,32]. Most of the indices designed for remote sensing based on satellite imagery can be applied or adapted to multispectral sensors mounted on UAVs.Due to the low altitude of flights and the high resolution of the sensors carried by UAVs, the accuracies of photogrammetric products can reach 0.053 m, 0.070 m, and 0.061 m in the X, Y, and Z directions, respectively, even in environs with extreme topography [33]. These accuracy levels make it possible to evaluate phytovolume at a local scale and to calibrate satellite data based on a regional scale. In this way, biomass estimation becomes more efficient, even in inaccessible mountain areas.Furthermore, the spatiotemporal monitoring of phytovolume can be undertaken when UAVs operate in autonomous navigation mode with programmed flight routes, thanks to the control devices based on the global navigation satellite system (GNSS). Unlike in satellite imagery, the temporal resolution of UAV imagery is controlled by the user, so flights can be programmed to register a dramatic change of phytovolume, e.g., pre- and post-fire [27].This work aimed to evaluate the ability of four phytovolume estimation methods, all obtained using the difference between DSM and DTM, based on very high-resolution spatial imagery collected by a multispectral sensor onboard a UAV. If phytovolume could be accurately estimated based on UAV-photogrammetry and multispectral imagery, then a new indirect method for indirect biomass estimation could be developed, characterising the apparent density of the predominant vegetation.The DSM was obtained from the UAV-photogrammetric process, while the four DTMs were calculated following the most common methods in bibliography about multispectral imagery, that is, interpolation of unclassified dense point cloud produced through a UAV-photogrammetric project and interpolation of unsupervised classified dense point cloud based on a multispectral vegetation index and using a cloth simulation filter.", 1.

402,"The experimental plot was located on the northern face of the Sierra de los Filabres with geographic coordinates 37°18’35.30″N, 2°36’9.67″W (European Terrestrial Reference System 1989, ETRS89) (Figure 1) in the Alcóntar municipality in the province of Almería (Spain), belonging to the Béticas mountain range [36]. The forest is 5.5 km and 3.5 km from the Special Areas of Conservation of Calares de Sierra de Baza and Sierra de Baza, respectively, which are included in the European Natura 2000 Protected Areas Network [37].The climate in Sierra de los Filabres is classified as semi-arid Mediterranean with a short, warm, arid summer and a long, cold, dry winter. The annual average temperature is 13.9 °C, and the annual average precipitation is 444 mm. Precipitation is scarce and irregular, and pluriannual droughts are relatively frequent and intense.The potential vegetation includes mid-mountain basophil holm oaks. Shrubs in regressive phase abound due to anthropogenic action on the territory, which is now abandoned, including old rain-fed crops, mining, and recent reforestation. The two most frequent species are gorse (Genista scorpius) and esparto grass (Macrochloa tenacissima), although some others appear in minor proportion, like Bupleurum falcatum, Helianthemum nummularium, Astragalus propinquus, and Retama sphaerocarpa L.According to the Environmental Information Network of Andalusia (REDIAM) [33], soils in the study area are classified as eutric cambisols, eutric regosols, and chromic luvisols with lithosols.The total surface of the study area was 3.41 ha with an average elevation of 1288.46 m above sea level, ranging from 1233 m to 1240 m, and the average slope was 41.51%.", 2.

403,"The UAV-photogrammetric flight was carried out on 17 December 2018, on a sunny day (Figure 2).The UAV used in this work was equipped with a Parrot Sequoia multispectral camera [38] mounted on a motion-compensated three-axis gimbal, and the chosen platform was a rotatory wing DJI Matrice 600 Pro UAV with six rotors (Figure 3).The Parrot Sequoia camera collects multispectral imagery that includes the green, red, red-edge, and near-infrared wavelengths through four 1.2-megapixel (1280 × 960) sensors (Figure 3). The focal length of the four lenses is fixed at 4 mm, and horizontal and vertical FOVs of 61.9 and 48.5, respectively. When the flight height above ground level is 56 m, the average ground sample distance (GSD) is 3 cm. The camera also collects Red, Green and Blue (RGB) imagery with an integrated high-resolution 16-megapixel (4608 × 3456) sensor that reaches a 1.5 cm GSD at a 56 m flight height.Light conditions in the same spectral bands as the multispectral sensor are captured by an irradiance sensor to collect irradiance during flight operations and correct possible fluctuations, calculating the absolute reflectance in post-processing.UAV positioning is based on a differential real-time kinematic (d-RTK) device composed of a double antenna onboard the UAV, a base station that emits real-time corrections from land, and a GNSS triple-redundant antenna system. The horizontal and vertical positioning accuracies that can be achieved are 1 cm + 1 ppm and 2 cm + 1 ppm, respectively, and 1.3 degrees in orientation.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle and Sensor,2
404,"Scale heterogeneity is one of the most important problems to solve in photogrammetry, especially when the flight altitude is low and the terrain to model is steep. In UAV-photogrammetry, the flight routes can be planned to maintain a constant distance over the terrain.In this work, UgCS 3.0 PRO software [39] was applied for designing a flight route with a constant 56.2 m altitude above ground level (AGL) (Figure 4), based on a prospective low-resolution DSM previously processed with a UAV general flight.A total of 1220 visible and multispectral images were acquired during the flight carried out with longitudinal and transversal overlaps of 70% and 55%, respectively, and a 23 min total flight time at 4 m/s. At the time of flights, the sun elevation ranged from 23.71° to 29.33°.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Flight Route Planning ,2
405,"All the products obtained from the photogrammetric project, including DSM, DTM, and point cloud, must be referenced to the same coordinate system to be processed. The imagery co-registration and georeferencing was undertaken based on the ETRS89 coordinates of ten ground control points (GCPs) that were scattered on the study area following the recommendations of [32,40]. The three-dimensional (3D) coordinates of GCPs were measured with a very accurate device composed of a receptor Trimble R6 working in the post-processed kinematic (PPK) mode and a wayside base station (Figure 5). The post-processing of the measured coordinates of GCPs was undertaken by Trimble Real-Time eXtended (RTX) correction services [41]. This high-accuracy global GNSS technology combines real-time data with positioning and compression algorithms that can reach a horizontal accuracy of up to 2 cm.Horizontal coordinates were referenced to the official reference system in Spain, UTM 30 N (ETRS89), and elevations were referenced to MSL using the EGM08 geoid model.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Survey Campaign,2
406,"The UAV-photogrammetric project was undertaken with Pix4Dmapper Pro [42] software using the input data from Sequoia, including three visible channels with 1.2 megapixels and four multispectral channels with 16 megapixels. Some of the most efficient photogrammetric algorithms in the UAV context involving RGB and multispectral imagery are SfM and MVS [29,30]. Pix4Dmapper Pro [42] software implements these algorithms, and it was used in this work for image calibration, bundle adjustment, point cloud densification, DSM and DTM interpolation, and image orthorectification. Blurred images were removed from the data set, and the EXIF data from all the images, which included the internal calibration parameters and coordinates of the principal points, were loaded before the calibration process. The radial and decentring distortion coefficients, focal length, and principal point coordinates were calibrated by iterative approximations for each of the sensors included in the camera.Once the image calibration processes were completed, the iterative process of bundle adjustment was based on sets of tie points automatically identified by autocorrelation in the overlapped areas of the images. The number of overlapping images in all the locations of the study area must be enough to ensure the accuracy of the process.The absolute geolocation of the photogrammetric block through the manual identification of the GCP coordinates in the images made it possible for all the photogrammetric products to have the same reference, including DSM, DTM, an RGB orthoimage and monochromatic reflectance orthorectified images, corresponding to each of the four channels.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Photogrammetric Algorithm,2
407,"According to some authors, e.g., [4,5,43], in situ measurement of phytovolume is time-consuming and can even be unaffordable when the forest study area is inaccessible. In this study, reference data were obtained through a systematic sample that combined the well-known dry-weight rank and comparative yield methods. The evaluation of the four phytovolume estimators was carried out using statistical tests that compared the level of matching with the reference data. The dry-weight rank method [44] consists of ranking the species that contribute the most weight in all quadrats of each parcel. The result provides an estimation of the relative contribution of various species to the total biomass of a site expressed in percentage values. In each sampled quadrat, the first, second, third, and fourth most abundant species are determined, and ranks from one to four are assigned respectively. Once the sample is finished, the total of ranks per species is averaged, and the percentage of each species in the total biomass is obtained. By applying the apparent density obtained from the harvested quadrats in each parcel, combined with the comparative yield method [45], phytovolume was deduced from total biomass and compared to the phytovolume estimation obtained by the four compared methods.In this work, four circular parcels with a surface of 500 m2 were distributed throughout the study area to characterise the species distribution (Figure 2). Inside each of the parcels, ranks from one to four were established in 48 equidistant quadrats in the four cardinal directions, which implied a total of 768 sample points.Furthermore, one 1 m2 parcel belonging to each of the four ranks was harvested, dried, and weighed in the laboratory for biomass–rank relationship calibration. The apparent density of each rank was calculated for biomass-to-phytovolume transformation.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.6. Phytovolume Reference Data,2
408,"The estimates of phytovolume were obtained by taking the difference between the DSM produced by the UAV-photogrammetric project and four DTMs obtained in different ways. The DSM was regularly interpolated from the dense point cloud and represented the evolving surface to canopy and bare soil. If the points located at the canopy are excluded from the dense point cloud, the resting points can be considered located at bare soil and thus belong to the DTM that is finally interpolated. Three of the methods to obtain DTMs come from three different ways to separate the points of the cloud belonging to canopy and soil.The point cloud produced by the photogrammetric project involves the vegetation masses and bare soil. In the phytovolume based on unclassified dense point cloud produced through the FFU method, the bare soil points are separated by attending exclusively to morphological criteria. A morphological analysis over the interpolated TIN from the point cloud was undertaken, detecting break lines where the gradient of the orientation of faces changed abruptly. All the points located between two consecutive break lines of relative minimum elevation are classified as soil. The interpolation of the obtained soil point cloud delivered the DTM, called FFU DTM in this case.In the phytovolume based on the classified dense point cloud (FFC) method, semantic classes are detected by applying the unsupervised classification methods described by [34] to the dense point cloud produced by UAV-photogrammetry. The classification is based on off-the-shelf machine learning and takes into account not only geometric features, but also the reflectance behaviour of the individual pixels. The point cloud classified as soil was interpolated obtaining the FFC DTM.In the phytovolume based on the FMI method, extracting the vegetation point from the dense point cloud is undertaken using just radiometric criteria. The near-infrared (NIR) and red bands are used to calculate the well-known normalised vegetation index (NDVI). Using the NIR and red channels as input data, the NDVI was obtained using Equation (1), which represents the directly proportional relationship between photosynthetic activity of the plants and the difference between reflectance in the NIR and red bands due to the characteristic chlorophyll property of differential absorbance in both wavelengths.

To detect vegetation pixels in the study area, a sample of non-vegetation areas was statistically characterised. The sample size was close to 10% of the non-vegetation pixels of the study area. The maximum NDVI of the sample was used as a threshold to reclassify the NDVI map as vegetation. This process delivered a binary map containing vegetation and soil points, which was used to mask the vegetation points. Once the soil points were extracted, the FMI DTM was interpolated.The fourth method for phytovolume estimation (FCS) is based on the cloth simulation filter for separate ground and non-ground points. This filter was originally designed by [35] to extract ground points in discrete return LiDAR point clouds. It consists of a mathematic algorithm that inverts the DSM, and a rigid cloth covering the inverted surface is assimilated to the inverted DTM. Due to the cloth’s rigidity, it evolves to ground points, producing the FCS DTM.According to the recommendations of [40], the DTMs were interpolated by the inverse distance weighting method in the four cases with a power of two, searching kernels of 5 × 5 pixels and 2 cm pixel size.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.7. Methods to Obtain DTMs,2
409,"The accuracy of the vegetation detection is a prerequisite for reaching a good phytovolume estimate. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons [46] determined the ability of the phytovolume estimators for vegetation detection and occupied volume, respectively.The difference between DSM and each of the four DTMs must be close to zero in areas occupied by bare soil. Indirectly, vegetation masses are morphologically defined by all the grouped pixels with a certain height. Once vegetation maps were obtained from four DTMs, two quantitative analyses were undertaken. First, the chi-squared test was applied to all the possible pairwise comparisons of vegetation areas obtained from phytovolume estimators to detect significant differences between them for vegetation area detection. Then, the four vegetation maps were compared to a vegetation map obtained by photointerpretation of the georeferenced RGB orthoimage using error matrix analysis to determine the accuracy of cross-tabulations expressed by the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of agreement. The photointerpretation was completed by digitizing vegetated and non-vegetated areas observed in the orthoimage, after using a non-supervised classification process to assess the two most frequent classes in the study area.For the quantitative analysis to determine the phytovolume estimation ability, first, classified standardised difference images between all the possible pairwise estimators were obtained with z-scores divided into six classes. With these studies, the significant differences in phytovolume estimation were determined. Second, the error of each of phytovolume estimation was calculated, comparing the in situ observed phytovolume in sample quadrats to the phytovolume estimated at the same locations in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE).The flowchart shown in Figure 6 summarises the methodology applied in this work.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.8. Chi-Squared Test and Confusion Matrices,2
410,"A total of 242 visible images, about 99% of which were calibrated, and 968 multispectral images, 97% of which were calibrated, were processed. In the bundle adjustment process, a median of 76,600 key points per image were identified in the visible images dataset, and close to 53,530 keypoints were identified per multispectral image. All the visible and multispectral orthoimages produced were resampled to a GSD of 2 cm and georeferenced with an RMS error of 1.9 cm.The shutter speed was constant and sufficient to reach a transversal and longitudinal overlap of 70% and 55%, respectively, distributed in 11 flight paths. Thus, all the pixels belonging to the study area were registered in at least five images.Visible and multispectral sensors were post-calibrated based on the previous internal calibration by the manufacturer, including the distortion parameters, focal length, centre, and size of the sensors. For co-registration of the multispectral images, the camera models of the four channels were referenced to a unique reference using a median of 5089 matches between each pair of channels.The photogrammetric project was referenced to the official coordinate system in Spain (ETRS89), UTM zone 30, northern hemisphere, using elevations with respect to MSL. The geoid model was EGM08, and the accuracies obtained from RTX post-processing were 1.8, 3.4, and 1.1 cm in the X, Y, and Z coordinates, respectively.The first partial result obtained from the photogrammetric project was a dense point cloud (Figure 7) composed of 25.13 million 3D points irregularly distributed, which implies an average density of 352.57 points/m3.By connecting all the points of the cloud, a TIN was generated by Poisson surface reconstruction [47], which considers all the points at once, thus reducing data noise. The resulting TIN was composed of 12.7 million vertices and 25.3 million facets.The DSM was obtained by applying an inverse distance weighting method to interpolate a regular 2 cm matrix that evolves to canopy and bare soil. Two filters were applied to remove noise and smooth the surface [34,42].With this information, the RGB orthoimage and four orthoimages in reflectance units corresponding to the multispectral channels were orthorectified (Figure 8). All these products were georeferenced and saved in GeoTIFF format.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.9. UAV-Photogrammetric Products,2
411,"The FFU and FFC DTMs were interpolated in a regular matrix of 10 cm pixels. When the FMI method was applied, the maximum NDVI in the sample soil area was 0.35. This value was used as a threshold to reclassify the NDVI map as vegetation for pixels with NDVI higher than 0.35 and non-vegetation otherwise (Figure 9). Interpolation of the soil point cloud produced the FMI DTM, resampled with pixels of 2 cm.The set parameters that controlled the extract ground points process by the FCS method were the 0.4 m cloth resolution or cloth grid size, the maximum number of 500 terrain simulations, and the 0.1 m threshold for classification. The classification threshold refers to a threshold to classify the point clouds into ground and non-ground parts based on the distances between points and the simulated terrain. Close to 41.4% of the points were classified as ground points.In the four described cases, the difference between DSM and DTMs provided raster maps where each pixel represents the height of the vegetation. By multiplying these values by the surface associated with a 2 cm2 pixel, four raster maps representing phytovolume estimators were obtained (Figure 10).", 3. Results, 3.1. Phytovolume Estimation,3
412,"Two types of result analyses were carried out: Qualitative, to determine the ability of the estimators for detecting vegetation areas, and quantitative, to evaluate the estimation of phytovolume accuracy. The qualitative analysis involved three steps. The first was extracting vegetation groups from the four estimators and reclassifying the difference maps between DSM and the four DTMs. Values close to zero were considered soil; up to 1.5 m, shrubs; and more than 1.5 m, trees (Figure 11).Second, the statistical significance of the difference between vegetation masses detected was determined using the McNemar chi-squared test with the proportion of joining classes. Tests showed evidence of differences between all the possible pairwise comparisons of vegetation detected with 95% confidence, except between FFU and FMI.Third, the four vegetation areas detected were compared to observed classes, delineated by photointerpretation. The similarity between reference data and each of the estimators was evaluated through the corresponding cross-tabulation of confusion matrices, shown by Table 1. Table 2 shows the resulting kappa and Cramer’s statistics [46,48].A higher similarity with the reference data was presented by FMI and FFU, while FFC and FCS did not reach levels that could be considered similar to the reference, due to Cramer’s values decreasing below 0.6.Some studies were carried out regarding the quantitative analysis to establish the ability for phytovolume estimation. First, all the pairwise comparisons between the phytovolume estimators, as defined in Figure 10, were considered, and the six possible differences between them were calculated. A sample of 2860 data points was extracted from each of the differences, verifying that the distribution was normal with the Kolmogorov–Smirnov test [46,48] at 95% confidence. To quantify the differences between estimator pairs, a classified standardised difference image was created for each pair difference, with z-scores divided into six classes of variance (Figure 12).Considering those zones with a z-score higher than two variances to be significant changes, not one of the possible comparisons presented significant differences except those between FFU and FFC, in which 11.12% of the study area showed a z-score higher than two variances.However, a qualitative comparison of the four phytovolume estimators with the in situ observed phytovolume reference in 768 sample data points was undertaken. The RMSE obtained were 12.3 m, 17.6 m, 66.3 m, and 78.2 m for FMI, FFU, FFC, and FCS, respectively. These ranks suggest that the characteristic radiometric behaviour of the pixels belonging to the canopy is the most efficient tool for separating bare soil and vegetation points and hence generate an accurate DTM.", 3. Results, 3.2. Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis,3
413,"The order of magnitude of the global agreement obtained in this work was the same as in previous studies based on biomass estimations using LiDAR remote sensing [3]. Some authors, like [7], determined a global agreement of 76% to 85% when using fused satellite images with LiDAR for fuel-type detection. Logistic regression coefficients close to 70% for modelling fire danger based on satellite imagery were found by [20]. With similar material used in the present work, several fire severity indices were evaluated by [27] based on UAV data with a kappa of 0.536.From a practical point of view, FFU and FFC obtain the DTMs from the photogrammetric project. However, while FFU does not need postprocessing, a dense point cloud classification process must be carried out in FFC. In order to automate the classification, an unsupervised algorithm based on the frequency of each class was applied, and five target classes were established. On the other hand, morphological analysis of the DSM for extracting DTMs in the cases of FFU and FFC is highly influenced by the scale factor, which has been described as a frequent source of error.The main advantage of FMI comes from the vegetation index chosen, which is able to accurately detect vegetated areas. However, the need of near infrared information limits the use of UAV on-board cameras working on the visible spectrum. Furthermore, dead vegetation tends to be excluded from phytovolume estimation, although this effect was not significant in this work.One of the main practical difficulties of FCS is setting the correct parameters of the mathematical model in each type of terrain. Results of FCS mainly depend on a threshold value to classify the point clouds into ground and non-ground parts, based on the distances between points and the simulated terrain. In future works, a sensibility analysis could establish the threshold value with better results, and supervised classifications could be applied to adapt the phytovolume estimation to each case of study. Particularly, pixel-based classification by Neural Network and Object Based Image Analysis could separate vegetated and non-vegetation areas with higher accuracy, and even recognition of individual species.Using radar and satellite data, regression coefficients between 0.6 and 0.9 for biomass modelling were reported by [18], and fuel-type maps from satellite data with an overall accuracy of 74% were calculated by [19]. The novelty of the indirect estimations obtained in this study is related to the UAV data characteristics: High efficiency and flexibility to adapt the accuracy in each case. Compared to LiDAR, the volume of UAV data is lower. The manpower needed to obtain phytovolume estimation based on UAV data is lower than that of the manual sample, and UAV allows for work in forests with limited accessibility at a reasonable cost.", 4. Discussion,None,4
414,"According to the obtained results in the Mediterranean forest in this work, FMI was the best phytovolume estimator, showing the lowest RMSE calculated with the in situ reference data observed at 768 sample sites grouped in four parcels of 500 m2.The FMI model was the best for detecting vegetated areas, showing statistically significant differences, with respect to the other estimators at a confidence level of 95%.Estimating the surface occupied by shrubs obtained from FFU, FFC and FCS were compared with FMI, concluding that FMI–FFU comparison presents the best similarity among all the possible pairwise comparisons. In absolute terms, FMI is the method that best estimates the surface occupied by vegetation compared to the vegetation surface observed by photointerpretation and supervised classification.In relative terms and considering all the possible pairwise comparisons of phytovolume estimation, differences between them are lower than two variances, except between FFU and FFC.The use of FMI based on UAV data provides accurate phytovolume estimations that can be applied to several environment management activities, including wildfire prevention. Multitemporal phytovolume estimations could help to model the evolution of forest resources in a very realistic way.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
415,"Anthropogenic global warming is estimated to currently have reached about 1 °C above preindustrial levels and is estimated to further increase to 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052 under current rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [1]. This increase in global temperature is expected to lead to an increase in intensity and frequency of extreme events such as heatwaves, drought, and associated wildfires [2,3,4]. In 2018, Europe faced such an extreme event characterized by record-breaking temperatures and long-lasting dryness, referred to as “hotter drought” [5]. According to the European Drought Observatory of the European Commission, most of Northern and Central Europe was affected by such hotter drought in 2018. On the contrary, much of the Southern Mediterranean Europe experienced relatively cool and moist conditions [6,7]. For Central Europe, various news and media articles reported severe decrease in crop yields, increase in elderly mortality, and forest fires along with many other adverse impacts. According to a quick attribution study by the World Weather Attribution on the heat in Northern Europe [8], the anthropogenic climate change has more than doubled the probability of occurrence of such a heatwave in the region.Along with severe economic implications and adverse health impact on the public, such record-breaking hotter drought events severely affect ecosystems. A direct comparison of vegetation response to the drought in 2018 and the 2003 European heatwaves using MODIS’s vegetation indices concluded that negative impacts in 2018 were even stronger than in 2003, with a strong decline in agricultural land and forests, especially in Central Europe [6]. Such drought events strongly affect the carbon cycle by leading to plant mortality and reductions in ecosystem carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake, with the potential to convert ecosystems from carbon sinks into carbon sources [9,10].Gross primary productivity (GPP) is a measure of ecosystem CO2 assimilation. The estimation and modeling of regional or global GPP involves various uncertainties arising from model parameterization [11,12], thus demanding a more direct and reliable approach to estimate GPP. With recent advances in satellite-based measurements of solar-induced (chlorophyll) fluorescence (SIF), it is now possible to use SIF as a direct proxy for photosynthesis or GPP worldwide [13,14,15,16,17]. SIF is an electromagnetic signal emitted in the wavelength range of 600 to 800 nm by chlorophyll molecules [18]. Since SIF is directly associated with photosynthesis, it is more physiologically-based compared to the traditionally used vegetation indices (VIs), such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) [19,20]. Over the last decade, several studies have demonstrated a strong linear relationship between satellite-based SIF and GPP [13,15,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28], indicating that SIF might provide a useful approximation of GPP. The SIF retrievals obtained from the Japanese Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and the European Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) were most widely used in the last decade (2007–2017; see studies in [21,22,23,24,28]). However, due to coarse spatial resolution of the SIF footprint (10 km diameter for GOSAT and 40 × 40 km2 for GOME-2), these satellites presently impose serious limitations in detecting ecophysiological changes across different vegetation types. The recent NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) satellite (launched in September 2014) provides SIF data at a much higher spatial resolution of 1.3 × 2.25 km2 with increased SIF acquisition frequency, thereby allowing us to resolve SIF responses of various vegetation types under different climatic conditions [15,29]. SIF acquired from GOSAT and GOME-2 have been previously used to study the effect of drought on vegetation. Using GOSAT’s SIF [30] showed that midday fluorescence explained the water stress over the Amazonian forests during a dry season in 2010. Yoshida et al. [31] used GOME-2′s SIF to study the impact of the 2010 Russian drought, and they highlighted the drought-related SIF decrease for croplands and grasslands. Sun et al. [32] studied the drought onset mechanisms and its impact on agriculture using GOME-2 SIF during the drought of 2011 in Texas and that of 2012 in the central Great Plains, United States. They concluded that SIF is sensitive to both structural and physiological variation in vegetation during drought and considered it an appropriate tool for drought monitoring. Koren et al. [33] developed a GOME-2 based SIF product to show that spatial SIF response was in good agreement with meteorological (temperature, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and terrestrial water storage) anomalies during the 2015–2016 El Niño Amazon drought. Recently, Zhang et al. [34] constructed a global gridded SIF dataset (CSIF) using a neural network trained by OCO-2 and MODIS data, which they also employed for drought monitoring. Their preliminary result showed that the CSIF well captured the spatial extent of droughts during the 2015 European heatwave.Here, we present the impact of the 2018 European hotter drought on the terrestrial ecosystem as perceived through OCO-2 SIF data. The novelty of this study is highlighted through the detection of spatial and temporal patterns of OCO-2 SIF responses to drought and heat across different vegetation types. We capture and analyze the spring–summer seasonal variation and anomaly in chlorophyll fluorescence across different vegetation types and tracked it with vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature anomalies. Furthermore, we compare SIF responses of different vegetation types under drought and non-drought conditions in Europe to explore the ability of OCO-2 SIF for drought impact characterization. We also discuss and compare our results with recent MODIS-based NDVI drought impact study. Finally, we discuss the drought-induced changes in satellite-based SIF measurements and perspectives of OCO remote sensing satellite products for future studies.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
416,"The study area is restricted to the European Union. About a third of Europe (1.8 M km2, drought area, Figure 1a–c) was under consecutive spring (March–May; SPEI-3 of May month) and summer (June–August; SPEI-3 of August month) meteorological drought (drought area), according to the widely accepted Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) [35] (Figure 1a–c). In addition, from mid-July to mid-August, Central Europe was affected by heatwaves with temperatures more than 5 °C higher than average for more than a week (NOAA Global Climate Report for July and August 2018 [36,37]). These drought and heat conditions resulted in a severe decline in agricultural yields and early leaf senescence as well as forest fires across Central and Northern Europe. At the same time, about a third of Europe (2 M km2, non-drought area, Figure 1a–c) experienced non-drought (i.e., normal or wet) conditions during spring and summer, mostly across the Mediterranean (Figure 1a–c). Although Spain and Portugal did experience record-breaking temperatures during summer, above-normal precipitation prevented drought conditions to prevail. Thus, Europe in 2018 provides us the opportunity for a comparative study between the productivity under consecutive spring–summer drought and that under non-drought conditions.", 2.

417," 2.2.1. SIF DataLight energy absorbed by the leaf chlorophyll molecules has three different pathways: photochemistry, nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ, i.e., heat dissipation), and a small fraction re-emitted as SIF [18]. Theoretically, SIF can be expressed as shown in Equation (1) [22]:

SIF = APAR × ΦF × ΩC = PAR × fPAR × SIFyield


(1)


where APAR is the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation in Watts/m2, which is the product of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed (fPAR) by the vegetation/canopy. SIFyield is the emitted SIF per photon absorbed [17] and is also defined as the effective fluorescence yield of the canopy. SIFyield is the product of fluorescence yield in the wavelength band of measurement (ΦF) and an escape probability term (ΩC). SIFyield is expected to vary with the plant’s photosynthetic light use efficiency [38,39] and canopy structural characteristics like leaf area index (LAI). However, with a satellite-based SIF measurement, it is challenging to separate the canopy physiological (ΦF) and structural components (ΩC) from SIFyield [32,40], and this is still an active area of research.For this study, the SIF product from NASA’s OCO-2 satellite was used since other satellite-based SIF retrievals were of coarser spatial resolution (GOSAT and GOME-2). OCO-2 SIF is made available by the CO2 Data Portal managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, United States (https://co2.jpl.nasa.gov/). The OCO-2 spectrometer measures spectra in the O2-A band (757–775 nm, full width at half maximum = 0.042 nm), with far-red SIF, retrieved at 757 and 771 nm based on the infilling of Fraunhofer lines [29,41]. The SIF retrieved at 771 nm is typically about 1.5 times smaller than obtained at 757 nm [41]; therefore, we utilized the SIF retrieved at 757 nm in our study. The major advantage of OCO-2 SIF includes a roughly 100-fold increase in data acquisition frequency over GOSAT and finer spatial resolution (1.3 × 2.25 km2). This enables OCO-2 to acquire more than 105 clear-sky soundings on land per day, thus providing the opportunity to perform in-depth SIF based analysis, such as regional ecophysiological change detection [42,43]. However, OCO-2 SIF soundings do not have full spatial coverage (Figure S1). In this study, the SIF retrievals from the Level-2 OCO-2 Lite product, data version SIF v8 (version 8) were used from their first availability (6 September 2014) to 1 October 2018 for the whole European continent. The OCO-2 Lite product is bias-corrected and contains only good quality SIF soundings [44]. The OCO-2 takes measurements in three different observation modes, namely nadir, glint viewing, and a special target mode with different viewing zenith angle (VZA), typically alternatively with a repeat cycle of 16 days. Although SIF values are affected by VZA [45], grouping all the SIF soundings over a large area results in no significant SIF difference in the mean SIF between nadir and the combined modes [13,16] (see Supplementary Table S1. In this study, we used SIF soundings from only nadir and glint mode, with each mode contributing to about half of the total number of soundings. The percentage of nadir and glint mode data was consistent throughout the study period (Table S2). Figure S1 illustrates the trajectory and spatial distribution of the SIF soundings for Europe in 2018. The OCO-2 is a sun-synchronous satellite with a local overpass time at 1:30 p.m. compared to 9:30 a.m. for GOME-2 and 1:00 p.m. for GOSAT. Thus, compared to GOME-2, OCO-2 might better capture the sensitivity of fluorescence yield to water stress, which is higher in the afternoon when plant water stress tends to peak, as shown by field studies [46]. Two important environmental factors that regulate plant photosynthesis are temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). The SIF Lite data files also included VPD and temperature data from ECMWF for each SIF measurement. 2.2.2. MODIS DataTheoretically, SIF is directly related to fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR; Equation (1)). Thus, for improving the interpretation of SIF variation and anomalies, we used the MODIS Aqua fPAR product (MYD15A2H) version 6 [47,48], which is an 8-day composite dataset with a spatial resolution of 500 m covering the same period as the OCO-2 SIF dataset. The fPAR calculation is based on the 3D radiative transfer equation (Look-Up-Table based approach [49]), which takes the “best” quality spectral information of red and near-infrared bands within the 8-day period as an input, and a backup algorithm uses the empirical relationship based on NDVI. In addition, we also used the standard MODIS 16-day composite NDVI product [50] with a spatial resolution of 250 m, taken from Terra (MOD13Q1) and Aqua (MYD13Q1) for comparison with SIF. These composite products are constructed using the “best” quality pixel (i.e., low clouds, low view angle, and highest NDVI) over the 16-day period of Terra and Aqua measurements [50]. The MODIS products were obtained from the NASA Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC, https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products). Moreover, only good quality MODIS pixels (VI quality variable = 0, indicating good quality as per [50]) for fPAR and NDVI were chosen for subsequent analysis.  2.2.3. Corine Land Cover DataTo study the SIF variation across different vegetation types (agriculture, broadleaved forest, coniferous forest, and mixed forest), we used the most recent Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2018, Version 20b2 provided by the European Environmental Agency (EEA) (Figure S2). The CLC 2018 uses Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imageries for its construction, thereby achieving a minimum mapping width (resolution) of 100 × 100 m (CLC2018 Technical Guidelines, 2017; [51]). Agricultural land comprising arable lands, pastures, and heterogeneous agricultural area covered most of the parts of drought area (53%) and non-drought area (57%), followed by coniferous forest of about 37% in the drought area (Table S3).

418,"Light energy absorbed by the leaf chlorophyll molecules has three different pathways: photochemistry, nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ, i.e., heat dissipation), and a small fraction re-emitted as SIF [18]. Theoretically, SIF can be expressed as shown in Equation (1) [22]:

SIF = APAR × ΦF × ΩC = PAR × fPAR × SIFyield


(1)


where APAR is the absorbed photosynthetically active radiation in Watts/m2, which is the product of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed (fPAR) by the vegetation/canopy. SIFyield is the emitted SIF per photon absorbed [17] and is also defined as the effective fluorescence yield of the canopy. SIFyield is the product of fluorescence yield in the wavelength band of measurement (ΦF) and an escape probability term (ΩC). SIFyield is expected to vary with the plant’s photosynthetic light use efficiency [38,39] and canopy structural characteristics like leaf area index (LAI). However, with a satellite-based SIF measurement, it is challenging to separate the canopy physiological (ΦF) and structural components (ΩC) from SIFyield [32,40], and this is still an active area of research.For this study, the SIF product from NASA’s OCO-2 satellite was used since other satellite-based SIF retrievals were of coarser spatial resolution (GOSAT and GOME-2). OCO-2 SIF is made available by the CO2 Data Portal managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology, United States (https://co2.jpl.nasa.gov/). The OCO-2 spectrometer measures spectra in the O2-A band (757–775 nm, full width at half maximum = 0.042 nm), with far-red SIF, retrieved at 757 and 771 nm based on the infilling of Fraunhofer lines [29,41]. The SIF retrieved at 771 nm is typically about 1.5 times smaller than obtained at 757 nm [41]; therefore, we utilized the SIF retrieved at 757 nm in our study. The major advantage of OCO-2 SIF includes a roughly 100-fold increase in data acquisition frequency over GOSAT and finer spatial resolution (1.3 × 2.25 km2).

In this study, we used SIF soundings from only nadir and glint mode, with each mode contributing to about half of the total number of soundings. The percentage of nadir and glint mode data was consistent throughout the study period (Table S2).

421,"The gridded SPEI data for spring (March, April, and May (MAM); SPEI-3 for May month) and summer (June, July, and August (JJA); SPEI-3 for August month) were obtained from the SPEI Global Drought Monitor (http://spei.csic.es/index.html). The drought areas were defined as the areas which showed SPEI less than or equal to −1 (meteorological drought conditions) for both spring and summer season [52,53] of 2018, whereas the non-drought areas were the ones with SPEI greater than −1 (near normal and wet conditions, or non-drought conditions) for both spring and summer of 2018. Standardized meteorological-based drought indices can sometimes misrepresent actual climatic water balance (CWB) [54]. The SPEI values of less than −1 for the study area in 2018 completely indicated water deficit conditions with negative CWB values during the summer season (Figure S3). Figure 1c shows the drought and non-drought area used in this study. Thereafter, the OCO-2 SIF sounding data for the drought and non-drought areas were spatially joined to the CLC based on geographic intersection (intersection of SIF soundings and the CLC polygons). To study the variation of SIF across the drought and non-drought areas in spring and summer for Europe, we spatially aggregated all the daily SIF soundings for each of the above described vegetation types separately for drought and non-drought areas over the spring and summer season. SIF changes because of two reasons—firstly due to natural seasonal vegetation change during the growing season (e.g., change in chlorophyll content during the seasonal cycle) and secondly due to stress (e.g., heat and drought stress). To study the inter- and intra-seasonal SIF variation and anomalies during the drought in spring and summer, we compared the SIF, temperature, and VPD of 2018 (i.e., SIF_2018, Temp_2018, VPD_2018) with their baseline value (mean of 2015–2017, i.e., SIF_Mean, Temp_Mean, VPD_Mean) on a 5-day running average [9]. These anomalies of the average SIF at a given date would eliminate the SIF changes due to seasonality. It is important to note that Central Europe suffered from a heat wave during summer of 2015, with record high temperatures and a precipitation deficit [55,56], which may lower our detected impact of 2018. For each OCO-2 footprint, co-located MODIS’s NDVI and FPAR were interpolated in time and space so that the same sample is used for each dataset. Finally, the OCO-2 SIF was aggregated spatially (i.e., drought area) and temporally (i.e., 8-day) for it to be compared with NDVI and fPAR.We performed a Wilcoxon-rank sum test [57] to test for a significant location shift (i.e., the nonparametric difference of means) between the SIF_2018 and SIF_Mean. SIF, temperature, and VPD anomalies (i.e., SIF-diff, Temp-diff, and VPD-diff) were defined as differences between 2018 and average (e.g., SIF-diff = SIF_2018–SIF_Mean). With continued drought condition during the summer, Central Europe also experienced an intense heatwave during late July to early August 2018. The heatwave was pronounced in Belgium (BEL), Netherlands (NLD), Denmark (DEN), and Germany (DEU), according to the reports published by the Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium [58], the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute [59], the Danish Meteorological Institute [60], and the German Meteorological Office [61], respectively. To quantify the impact of this heatwave, SIF soundings of BEL, NLD, DEN, and DEU from 15 July to 15 August 2018 were analyzed for all the vegetation types and compared to the mean of 2015–2017. All analyses were processed in R [62] and extended by the packages stats, ggplot2 [63] and dplyr [64].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Data Analysis,2
422,"Overall, the whole of Europe showed average SIF_2018 values of 0.642 W/m2/sr/µm compared to SIF_Mean of 0.670 (Table 1a) during spring and summer seasons. Although the SIF anomaly (SIF-Diff) was not significant for spring and the combined spring–summer season for drought areas (Figure S1) and for the whole of Europe, the summer season showed a significant decrease (p-value < 0.001) in SIF_2018 compared to the SIF_Mean in the drought area (Table 1; Figure 2). The patterns of the combined spring–summer season SIF-Diff for drought and non-drought area (Figure 1c) were complementary to each other (Table 1a). In addition, the drought areas showed positive SIF-Diff for spring and negative SIF-Diff for summer and the combined spring–summer season, whereas the non-drought area showed positive SIF-Diff for spring and the combined spring–summer season. Although most of the SIF-Diff was not significant (p-value > 0.05), it is, however, interesting to see a distinct pattern between seasonal variability of SIF in relation to drought. ", 3. Results, 3.1. Overall Spring–Summer SIF Variation and Anomaly,3
423,"The drought area was characterized by higher temperatures during the second half of both spring and summer season (Figure 3b). For the drought area, SIF-Diff was initially significantly negative at the start of the spring season for the agricultural area, whereas the difference was not significant for forests. Here, significance is considered as a departure of (SIF/fPAR/NDVI) values >1 standard error [31,32], e.g., for Figure 3a, when the blue and red shades are not overlapping. However, with increase in Temp-Diff and VPD-Diff from a couple of weeks after the middle of spring season (Day of the year (DOY) - 120), SIF-Diff significantly increased across all land cover types (Figure 3a,b), with SIF-Diff values as high as 0.25, 0.65, 0.25, and 0.4 W/m2/sr/µm for agricultural area, broadleaved, coniferous, and mixed forests, respectively. The broadleaved forests (BLF) in the drought area occur across a large range of latitude (from 45 N in Germany to 70 N in Norway; Figure S2) and Köppen climate zones (warm summer and cool summer). More intense and early spring warming occurred in the warm summer climate, whereas a moderate and later warming occurred in the cool summer climate zone (blue and black line in Figure S7). This seems to have caused leaf flushing (represented by the blue and green box in Figure S7) at a difference of about 20 days between the two climate zones. Now, since our result is spatially and temporally aggregated, this shows two peaks during the spring for BLF. Thus, although there was no overall change in SIF for the spring season (Section 3.1), we observed a change in the intra-spring SIF variation pattern in 2018 compared to the mean, with an initial decrease (March to April) followed by a significant increase in SIF in May. This intra-spring SIF variation was reflected in the fPAR variations during the spring season for the drought area (Figure S4a). Thus, SIF variation in spring was strongly related to fPAR for drought areas where continuously higher temperature and VPD were observed in the second half of the spring season (April–May). The summer season of 2018 was characterized by negative SIF-Diff (Figure 3), especially for agricultural areas which showed continuously negative values throughout the summer season (Figure 3). For forest areas, however, we observed significantly negative SIF-Diff only in the later part of summer (from July, DOY 185–215) when the temperature values were more than 5 degrees higher than the mean (Figure 3b).The non-drought areas were characterized by significantly higher temperatures only during the end of April (DOY 105–120) as illustrated in Figure 4b. Here, we observed the spring variation to be similar to that of the drought area (Figure 4a,b), which is also visible in the fPAR data (Figure S4a). In contrast to the drought area, summer in the non-drought area featured positive SIF-Diff for all the vegetation types and especially for the agricultural area. For the non-drought area, fPAR in summer was higher than the mean value (Figure S5a) and also seems to closely relate to the SIF variation. ", 3. Results, 3.2. Intraseasonal SIF Variation and Anomalies for Different Vegetation Types,3
424,"Apart from the extensive drought conditions, Central Europe (i.e., BEL, NLD, DEN, and DEU) was also largely affected by the 2018 heatwave, which was characterized by unusually high temperature anomalies (+5–8 °C) from mid-July to mid-August (Figure 3a). Overall, during this heatwave in Central Europe, the SIF_2018 was 31% lower than SIF_Mean. This difference was most pronounced in agricultural areas which showed 34% lower SIF_2018 followed by mixed forest (25%), coniferous (22%), and broadleaved forest (16%) (Figure 5). ", 3. Results, 3.3. SIF Variation during the Heatwave,3
425,"Our study showed a clear impact of the European hotter drought of 2018 on overall and intra-seasonal SIF variation for different vegetation types as captured by the OCO-2 SIF. Early spring of 2018 was characterized by lower than average temperatures and VPD (i.e., non-stressed stage) followed by above-average temperatures and VPD in the later part of spring (April–May; Figure 3b). Such cooler and wetter conditions in early spring can result in poor crop development and lower productivity [65] and thus lower SIF values ([66]; Figure 3b). Moreover, the initially cooler conditions in spring might have delayed the leaf flushing in deciduous trees, resulting in lower SIF values of broadleaved forests (Figure 3b). This pattern was less evident for the coniferous and mixed forests, probably due to the presence of evergreen trees. In addition, the wet conditions during early spring most likely built up enough soil moisture for the later spring season, thus moderating the sudden warming in later spring season [67,68]. This combination of ample moisture supply with a rise in temperature resulted in an increase in SIF to above-average values across all vegetation types (Figure 3 and Figure 6). The variation in SIF depends on the variation of both APAR (and fPAR) and SIFyield (Equation (1), [69]). Both SIF and fPAR were increasing during the spring season for both drought and non-drought areas (Figure 3 and Figure 4, Figures S4a and S5a). Moreover, for agriculture areas affected by drought, the peaks of fPAR and SIF were on almost the same day of the year (DOY ~ 145; Figure 3a and Figure S4a). However, this clear synchronicity was not found for forests. Nevertheless, we conclude that the satellite-based SIF variation was closely coupled with fPAR variation under non-stress conditions (spring for drought areas and for non-drought areas in spring and summer). Previous studies [13,31,32] have also highlighted the synchronicity of satellite-based SIF with fPAR.The warming during late spring continued to the summer season, with the later summer season featuring intense heat. We found decreasing SIF in all investigated vegetation types in the summer of 2018, which was most pronounced in the drought areas. The agricultural areas expressed an immediate decrease in SIF from early summer onwards most likely because of severe soil moisture deficits caused by early water depletion in late spring in course of dry weather conditions [70,71]. Ongoing drought conditions during the summer season showed continuous decrease in SIF for agricultural areas and with some delay in forests (Figure 3). Similar findings were reported by an NDVI-based study where agricultural areas, and with some delay, forests in central Europe, faced severe decline in NDVI during the summer season [6]. Unlike agricultural crops, forests feature a buffered microclimate [72,73,74], and given their deeper rooting system in comparison to crops, they have access to deeper soil water and thus can maintain constant photosynthesis rates for extended periods during drought conditions [75]. Our spring–summer seasonal variation of SIF in 2018 is in close agreement with the one of MODIS NDVI ([6]) for agricultural areas. However, for the forest ecosystems, we found a less extreme SIF decline compared to the NDVI-decline in Buras et al. [6]. To further evaluate this difference we analyzed MODIS NDVI over 4 years (2015–2018), and our results indicate that SIF showed higher sensitivity compared to NDVI over the 4-year period (Figure S4b and Figure 6). We observed that for the forest ecosystems in the drought area, fPAR- and NDVI-anomalies were positive during the summer season (DOY < 215) (Figure S4b and Figure 6), i.e., when the SIF-anomaly was reportedly negative. While Buras et al. [6] used a reference period spanning 2000–2018, where several normal and even moist summers were observed, the analyses presented here rely on the 2015–2017 period due to the comparably shorter mission length of OCO-2. However, in 2015 another severe drought hit central and southern Europe, which might have resulted in forest legacy effects [76], i.e., low productivity and die-back in affected areas in 2016 [77]. Consequently, regarding forests, the fPAR and NDVI values from 2018 do only marginally differ to the period mean (2015–2017) since forests could have been suffering at least in 2015 and 2016, i.e., in 2 of the 3 years included in the reference mean. It is, therefore, not surprising that the extremeness of 2018 in the 4 year NDVI analysis of forests (Figure S4 and Figure 6) did not capture the forest decline as clearly as in Buras et al. [6] (with a 19-year reference period) where the majority of reference years represent years with sufficient water supply. In contrast to NDVI over the four years period, SIF was considerably lower in 2018 compared to the already low mean of the previous three years (2015–2017), which may indicate its higher sensitivity to both physiological and structural drought response from plants [32]. This finding highlights the predominance of SIF over NDVI even if short reference periods are available, for example, SIF available from OCO-2, the upcoming OCO-3, and the TROPOMI in comparison to ESA’s SENTINEL-2A [78] (for NDVI). Vegetation indices (VIs), such as the NDVI, are sensitive to canopy structure and pigment concentration with no direct link to photosynthesis [79]. This might lead to a reduced sensitivity of these VIs to capture drought impact when the vegetation, such as high density forests, still remains green (no changes in chlorophyll content) but reduces its photosynthesis initially during heavily stressed drought conditions [80] in early summer during the European hotter drought. Similar conditions might also not have resulted in significant differences of NDVI during the early summer of 2018 from the mean (Figure S4b). Alternatively, higher sensitivity of SIF (with direct links to photosynthesis) to drought impact on high density European forest was evident from our study (Figure 3 and Figure 6). The intense heatwave in Central Europe during July and August resulted in a significant decrease in SIF across all the four vegetation types, which was particularly pronounced for agricultural areas. The heatwave occurred at the end of the already dry summer, which was preceded by a dry spring. As a consequence of persisting drought, many crops desiccated, thus not emitting any fluorescence by the end of July when temperatures were extremely high in Central Europe. Water stress due to high-temperature anomalies during a drought event can further increase heat stress due to an extended period of stomatal closure and subsequent reduction in evaporative cooling [81], thus causing positive feedback resulting in even warmer conditions [82].", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Drought Impact on SIF,4
426,"Water stress adversely impacts photosynthesis, either physiologically or structurally [83]. Physiological alterations include change in leaf biochemistry via reductions in enzymatic activity [84] or a reduction in mesophyll/chlorophyll, and stomatal conductance [85], resulting in lower CO2 uptake by the plants and thus reduced photosynthesis (i.e., lower SIF values). The structural changes include foliar changes like leaf wilting or rolling (changes in leaf inclination), thus reducing effective leaf area index (LAI), which in turn causes a reduction in fPAR and energy available for photosynthesis and fluorescence emission [69,86]. Furthermore, plants adopt different mechanisms to minimize water and heat stress, such as chloroplast avoidance movement, during which plants move their chloroplast from the cell surface to side walls of cell [87] so as to minimize APAR [88] and thus SIF. MODIS fPAR decreases due to these protection mechanism, and physiological and structural changes were visible for agricultural areas during the summer drought (Figure S4 and Figure 6). However, for the forest areas we found that MODIS fPAR for drought areas during midsummer (DOY 185–215) was not lower than fPAR in the previous 3 years (Figure 6 and Figure S4). This might imply that a reduction of SIF is likely caused by a reduction in SIFyield. SIF variation due to changes in SIFyield can be because of the canopy’s physiological (ΦF term of Equation (1)) or structural change (ΩC term of Equation (1)), or both. The PAR absorbed by leaves is partitioned into photochemistry, heat dissipation (NPQ), and fluorescence emission (SIF). Although fPAR (or APAR) did not decrease, the proportion of fPAR (or APAR) that is used in photochemistry (to drive electron transport for carbon assimilation) decreases, resulting in a surplus of photosynthetic energy. Now, two other pathways compete to de-excite the absorbed light that is not used in photochemistry (i.e., the surplus photosynthetic energy), the energy emitted as SIF or energy dissipated as heat through NPQ [69]. The competition between these two pathways depends on environmental stress [89], and during water stress conditions (drought), the reduction in SIF is linked to higher NPQ [66,90]. This increase in NPQ may result in a weak coupling between SIF/SIFyield and fPAR under water stress conditions (see Figure S8), which seems to be clearly visible for coniferous and mixed forests during midsummer (DOY 185–215; Figure S4). It is also possible that the MODIS fPAR could be erroneous [32] and not be the best estimate of fPAR, especially in case of high vegetation density (as in Europe). The backup algorithm of MODIS fPAR relies on its relationship with NDVI [49], which becomes nonlinear with a sharp drop of NDVI sensitivity to fPAR for moderate to high vegetation density for fPAR values beyond 0.7 (Figure S6). Nevertheless, further research to differentiate the canopy escape term (ΩC term of Equation (1)) from SIF (as demonstrated by [91,92]) to study changes in fluorescence yield (ΦF) (and SIFyield) during extreme large scale drought event is recommended.Our results highlight one more reason why OCO-2 SIF can be useful to study drought impact on vegetation as different vegetation types have different responses to drought, which was not efficiently captured for each vegetation types before because of the coarser resolution of preceding satellite-based SIF data/products. We would like to stress that earlier studies used SIF at coarser spatial resolutions (from GOME-2 or GOSAT) and mostly were not able to differentiate SIF responses for different vegetation types from a heterogeneous land-use area during drought conditions. Nevertheless, regarding the drought response of homogeneous vegetation types, our results are in line with previous SIF-based drought impact studies [31,32].", 4. Discussion, 4.2. SIF Response during Drought Stress,4
427,"OCO-2 with its increased data acquisition frequency and high spatial resolution was shown to be a promising tool to study large-scale drought impact on vegetation. Although the local pass time of 1:30 PM of OCO-2, allows for a more accurate estimate of SIFyield sensitivity to physiological plant water stress [46], there is a possibility of overestimation of this sensitivity during drought conditions. A combination of derived, improved SIF retrievals from GOME-2 (e.g., SIFTER, [33]), which has a local pass time of 9:30 AM, and OCO-2 should be used to explore and understand the morning–afternoon SIF variation during drought conditions. To better understand the mechanism of stress-induced fluorescence yield variation as captured by the OCO-2 SIF, models that explicitly represent SIF processes (e.g., SCOPE model) should be applied [31,93,94].The OCO-2 satellite provides a finer spatial resolution SIF data at the cost of temporal resolution (revisit time of 16 days). This might lead to errors due to sampling effects for drought impact studies, especially when comparing with MODIS composite products, as the OCO-2 SIF represents an instantaneous measurement (at 1 PM) performed every 16 days, whereas the MODIS composite represents the best value over a period (mostly 16 or 8 days). This sampling effect might also explain the two peaks in SIF data in broadleaved forest (Figure S7), and this effect is not observed in the NDVI data (Figure S4). However, in our study we deem this effect to be negligible as phenological changes in broadleaf forest during the spring warming of 2018 was well captured despite (Figure 4 and Figure S7) a low and dispersed representation of only 4% of the total study area (Table S3). Moreover, the SIF footprint location keeps changing during every revisit, as the satellite does not operate in a typical “pushbroom” fashion as other sun-synchronous satellites like Sentinel, Landsat, MODIS, etc. This does not allow for a pixel-based temporal analysis of the SIF data. However, with a higher data acquisition rate, this provides a great potential to study large-scale events [42]. Furthermore, a large-scale spatial aggregation of OCO-2 SIF also reduces the uncertainty in OCO-2 SIF measurement owning to higher clear-sky data acquisition rate [42].Our study also demonstrates the strong added value of SIF-products in comparison to more conventionally used products (NDVI, fPAR), when considering short reference periods (Figure 6 and Figure S4). Moreover, the new sensor of the OCO family (OCO-3) was recently launched on 3 May 2019, which has the same physical and measurement characteristics as compared to OCO-2. With this, a longer time series of high temporal frequency and spatial resolution SIF will be available in the near future. As presented in this study, OCO-2 SIF is sensitive to drought and can serve as a promising and potentially better satellite-based alternative to study impact of extreme events (droughts/floods/heatwaves) on terrestrial ecosystems. To further validate the potential of OCO’s SIF for such studies, a combination of satellite derived vegetation indices, photochemical reflectance index (PRI), SIF (e.g., TROPOMI), and flux data could be considered. A more in-depth site-based study is also recommended to get more insight into ecophysiological stress mechanism in forests during drought. Furthermore, an interpolation of OCO’s dataset through machine learning and statistical tools [34,95] to cover the vacant areas may provide solutions for more rigorous analyses. ", 4. Discussion, 4.3. OCO-2 SIF for Studying Drought Impact,4
428,"This study employed the satellite-based SIF measurements acquired from the recent OCO-2 satellite to study the impact of the 2018 European hotter drought on terrestrial ecosystems. Evidently, OCO-2 SIF displayed the spatial and temporal dynamics of the 2018 European drought across different vegetation types (agricultural area, broadleaved forest, coniferous forest, and mixed forest). Our results show that the agricultural areas were severely affected by the 2018 European hotter drought. While the SIF of forests showed a less strong reduction, legacy effects may become visible in the next years and thus, we recommend closely monitoring their behavior. In general, the impact of the heatwave in Central Europe during the July–August period showed an overall 31% decrease in SIF compared to the reference mean. The SIF variation was closely explained by fPAR variation during non-stressed conditions. However, during water-stress conditions (drought), the SIF variation was attributed to variation in SIFyield. Despite a few technical limitations of the OCO-2 SIF measurement such as the 16-day repeat cycle, it provides an excellent potential to study large-scale vegetation fluorescence variation at high spatial resolution and can improve our understanding of changes in ecosystem productivity during extreme events. Furthermore, owing to its direct origin from chlorophyll, OCO-2 SIF can serve as a complementary dataset to MODIS’s vegetation indices (NDVI/EVI). We suggest a more detailed comparison of vegetation indices and OCO-2 SIF to establish the latter’s sensitivity to vegetation’s structural and physiological changes. Further application of OCO-2 SIF may include process-based SCOPE modeling to understand the variation of complex fluorescence yield due to different environmental stress, as well as its combination with the XCO2 data (main product of OCO-2 satellite) to study regional carbon budgets.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
429,"The forest radiation regime is the basic driving factor for most physiological processes such as photosynthesis and respiration [1,2]. The spatiotemporal distributions of forest photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400~700 nm) in the three dimensional (3-D) space has great effects on sub-canopy snowmelt dynamics [3,4], understory evapotranspiration [5,6], and the growth and succession of tree seedlings [7,8]. It is determined by absorbing, scattering, and transmitting processes between solar PAR and foliage elements as it penetrates through a forest canopy [9,10]. These processes are dominated by factors including leaf orientation and morphology, the distribution pattern of foliage elements, solar position, and topographic conditions [11,12]. Extremely high heterogeneity could usually be observed for spatiotemporal distributions of forest PAR in both horizontal and vertical dimensions, especially at a sub-daily scale [13,14].The spatiotemporal variations of PAR could be conventionally and directly measured by pyranometers [15,16] and indirectly observed by digital hemispherical photography (DHP) [17,18,19] at different locations within a forest plot. However, it is difficult to set up a pyranometer observation network or to obtain DHPs in large or inaccessible forested areas, and the high spatial heterogeneity of PAR in complex forest areas cannot be effectively represented by data at specific sampling points. Therefore, their applications can’t be extended to larger spatial scales. To solve this issue, canopy light models became a powerful tool to investigate the 3-D spatiotemporal distributions of forest PAR [20]. The spatially explicit 3-D radiative transfer models have been developed in the past decades for non-randomly distributed heterogeneous forest canopies. They included the Beer law-based radiative transfer model [21,22,23], and the ray tracing model using Monte-Carlo simulation [24,25,26]. The Beer-Lambert law describes the exponential attenuation of solar radiation, and it is only applicable to situations where randomly distributed foliage elements can be assumed [27]. The detailed 3-D structure information of forest canopies is a prerequisite input for these computer-based models. For example, some models represented the tree crowns using different geometric objects such as a cone or cylinder, and the direct light could be traced during the daily solar course [28,29,30]. However, it is usually extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive to obtain forest canopy structural parameters such as tree height, diameter at breast height (DBH), crown size, and crown base height [14]. Moreover, compared with the real 3-D forest scene, the artificially reconstructed forest scene usually fails to capture the real gap distribution patterns, which makes the modelled radiation at the specific location deviate from the actual PAR values [31,32]. In addition, previous studies have shown that the estimation accuracy of aerial laser scanning (ALS)-derived forest canopy structural parameters will decrease slightly as data point density decreases [33,34]. However, how the point cloud density affects the accuracy of ALS-based 3-D canopy light models remains unclear.An accurate description of the tree structure is the key step to simulating the radiation regime of a forest canopy. With the development of light detection and ranging (lidar) technology, a detailed 3-D structure represented by lidar-based high-density point cloud data can be acquired efficiently. ALS has shown great potential for forest ecological applications at the landscape level [35,36]. To investigate the radiation regime of forest canopies, several ALS-based 3-D canopy light models have been successfully developed over the past decades [32,37,38]. Most of these models characterize the probability of direct or diffuse solar radiation penetrating through forest canopies based on various lidar-derived metrics such as the laser penetration index [39], leaf area density [40], point projection area on the ground surface [41], number of points around a solar ray [42], and synthetic hemispherical images derived from projected point cloud data [43,44]. More detailed 3-D canopy light models have been developed based on terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) to simulate radiation transmittance by voxel-based canopy reconstruction [45,46]. As a bridge linking ALS and TLS, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based lidar systems provide great flexibility in selecting data point density, as well as better delineation to the upper part of a canopy with top-down scanning [47,48]. However, a 3-D forest canopy radiation model driven by high-density UAV-based lidar data remains a necessary development.The PAR arriving at one point in the forest canopy mainly consists of direct components originating from the transmission and attenuation of beams and diffuse components derived from single and multiple scattering. Naturally, most canopy light models simulate them separately [12,39]. In terms of direct solar radiation, the length of the transmission path, defined as the distance between the first contacted point and the target point [13,30], is a widely used parameter to determine the extent of its potential attenuation [14,29]. It was found that a path-length based radiation simulation model is more flexible in terms of reproducing sub-daily and seasonal PAR variations [49]. Moreover, existing research found that a spatially explicit 3-D ray trace model incorporating path length could simulate the spatiotemporal distribution patterns of light intensity in the forest floor and along the vertical gradient [14]. However, it is usually not good enough to only consider the total path length to accurately characterize the light attenuation effect along its transmission path due to the non-random distribution of foliage elements within a forest canopy [50]. The gaps between clumped foliage elements along a light transmission path will alter their attenuation ability for direct solar radiation. In addition, the point density and distribution pattern along a light transmission path will also affect the ability of a direct beam penetrating through a forest canopy [33,51]. However, few studies have incorporated the gap size information into the path length-based method to characterize the light attenuation, and it is still unclear whether it is possible to improve the simulation accuracy of the light attenuation effect by incorporating the point density and distribution information. In terms of diffuse components, most research treats the diffuse light above the hemispherical sky as an isotropic distribution. The diffuse solar radiation reaching a specific location in a forest canopy is usually estimated based on the sky view factor or canopy closure [15,19,49]. To assume the isotropic diffuse solar radiation will affect the estimated radiation regime in 3-D space [52,53], while the difference remains unexplored.Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop a spatially explicit forest canopy radiation model to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of forest PAR within and under a forest canopy. The specific objectives of this study are to:Develop and validate a spatially explicit lidar-based 3-D forest canopy PAR simulation model treating direct and diffuse solar radiation separately;Characterize the attenuation effects of direct solar PAR along its transmission path penetrating through a forest canopy, andExplore the spatiotemporal variations of forest PAR in 3-D space and the effects of point density on the estimation accuracy of forest PAR simulation.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
430,"Our study area is located in the Baima (BM) experimental forest site in the city of Nanjing (119°11′8″E, 31°36′51″N), China (Figure 1). The site is a planted forest site with a relatively flat area and different tree species, densities, and ages. We set up a medium density (0.15 trees / m2) deciduous broadleaf circular forest plot with a radius of 15 m. The average tree height and crown size of this forest plot are 7 m and about 2~3 m, respectively. The effective leaf area index (LAIe) is about 1.5. The tree species of this forest plot is wheel wingnut (Cyclocarya paliurus) with an average spacing of 2 m between tree stems.", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.1. Study Sites,2
431," 2.2.1. UAV Lidar DataWe acquired the UAV-based lidar data in the BM site on July 26, 2017 on a clear day with the DJI M600 pro (DJI Technology Co. Ltd, Shenzhen, China) drone mounted with a Velodyne VLP-16 (Velodyne LiDAR Inc. San Jose, USA) lidar sensor coupled with a high precision inertial measurement unit (IMU). The scanning field of view (FOV) was set as ±15° with the laser wavelength of 903 nm and beam divergence of 0.18° (3.0 mrad) during the flight. The maximum scan rate of the lidar sensor was 300,000 points/s. Two cross flight paths (i.e., East-West and North-South) were designed to acquire relatively comprehensive forest point cloud data, which resulted in high-density (about 500 points/sqm) 3-D forest point cloud data (Figure 1b). 2.2.2. TLS DataIn the meantime, we also collected terrestrial lidar data using the Leica Scan Station 2 (Leica Geosystem AG, St. Gallen, Switzerland) at five different scanning locations with one center position and four corner positions, respectively. At each station, we scanned the plot using hemispherical mode (i.e., horizontal: 0~360°; vertical: −45~90°) by setting sampling spacing as 1 cm @ 10 m (1 cm at 10 m away from TLS station) with the laser wavelength of 532 nm. All TLS data from five different stations were registered into a comprehensive forest plot TLS point cloud. 2.2.3. Lidar Data Pre-ProcessingIn this study, we filtered ground points for both UAV and TLS lidar data using the tool ‘CSF’ in the ‘CloudCompare’ software package (version 2.6.2) (GPL software and available from http://cloudcompare.org). Then, the digital elevation model (DEM) and canopy height model (CHM) with the spatial resolution of 0.1 m were interpolated in ArcGIS software using ground points from UAV lidar data. In addition, after removing the noise points of TLS data, we removed all points lower than each PAR observation location to estimate the sky view factor for diffuse solar radiation calculation purposes. Accurately locating the observation points in 3-D both UAV- and TLS-based lidar data is a key step to assure the effectiveness of comparison between the lidar- and field-based PAR values. All nine observation locations were precisely captured by TLS data. By visually selecting two control points in both UAV- and TLS- lidar data space, we first calculated distances from each observation location to these two control points. Then, by using the distance intersection method we successfully located nine observation locations in the UAV-lidar data space (Table 1). 2.2.4. Field-Based PAR MeasurementsNine different light quantum sensors recorded photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) (μmol·m−2·s−1) with the average logging time interval of 5 minutes and heights of 1~2 m above the ground at different locations at the BM site from July 27 to July 28, 2017.

PAR Measurements NormalizationTo compare the PAR measurements from nine different light sensors, we conducted the data calibration process using a standard reference light quantum sensor (LI-190R, LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska) under the same light condition and indoor environment. By sampling the PAR readings from the to-be-calibrated sensor with the reference one at a step of 50 μmol·m−2·s−1 within the range from 0 to 2500 μmol·m−2·s−1, we calculated the difference between two readings.

, we could build a 3-D cylindrical buffer (S) region around the light beam l with the radius of r as it penetrates through a forest canopy. The radius r was determined by the sensitivity analysis in Section 2.4. The 3-D cylindrical buffer could be either occupied by points (i.e., “vegetation cluster”) or empty (i.e., “gaps”) resulting from non-random distribution of foliage elements. We projected each point within the buffer S onto the light beam l and computed their one-dimensional distances between each projected point and point

 along l (

). The point with the longest 


d

 was considered as the first contact point between light beams and forest canopy (


P

). We then applied the K-Means++ algorithm [54] to group the vegetation points and identify the gaps between foliage elements within the buffer S. The initial number of clusters (k) was set as half of the total number of points (N) within S, and the buffer was considered as an empty one if N was less than 2. Two clusters would be merged if the distance between their boundaries was less than 0.5 m determined by measuring the mean gap size manually. By iteratively clustering all points within the buffer S, we obtained five “vegetation clusters” (

 from the pyranometer readings during a daily solar course. 2.3.2. Diffuse PAR Estimation ModelThe sky diffuse distributes ununiformly in the upper hemisphere under a clear sky condition and it was controlled by the solar position. In this study, we incorporated our diffuse sky model with an anisotropic sky diffuse distribution model [52]. The model describes the variation of relative contributions of sky diffuse irradiance in each zenith-angle zone to horizontal irradiance with the various solar positions under clear sky conditions. We divided the upper hemisphere into nine zenith-angle zones with a 10° zenith angle interval, and their relative contributions varying with the solar zenith angle are shown in Figure 3.The angular gap fraction is defined as the proportion of partial or whole hemispherical sky not obscured by foliage elements of a forest canopy when viewed upwards from a specific location [55]. To calculate 

P
P

, the gap fraction of each annulus zone needs to be obtained, which can be estimated as follows. Firstly, all points above the target location and within a radius of R were cut out of the original point cloud and then projected onto a plane using a stereographic projection [56]. All projected points are distributed in a circle with a unit radius as shown in Figure 4. Secondly, the unit circle was divided into nine concentric annulus rings with 10° zenith angle (Figure 4). A specific zenith angle interval (

Δ
θ

) and azimuth angle interval (

Δ
φ

) were selected to divide each annulus ring into several trapezoidal facets. Due to the geometric distortion of stereographic projection, the point density of rings with higher zenith angles is much larger than those with lower zenith angles. Therefore, different values of 

Δ
θ

 and 

Δ
φ

 should be applied to each annulus ring. The 

Δ

θ
k


 and 

Δ

φ
k


 for the k-th (k=1 ~ 9) annulus ring were determined by the sensitivity analysis in Section 2.4. Thirdly, we could obtain the index (


i
k


,


j
k


) of the trapezoid that contained point (

θ
,
φ

) in the k-th annulus ring as:




i

(10)






j

)




(11)


where 
θ
 and 
φ
 are zenith angle and azimuth angle of each projected point. Considering that the area of facets near zenith is smaller than that adjacent to the horizontal plane, it is necessary to perform sinusoidal weighting on each facet [57]. The weight value assigned to the trapezoid with index (

i
,
j

) in the k-th annulus ring (


ω

j

) could be calculated as:

(12)

 as a flag indicating whether the trapezoid with index (

i
,
j

) in the k-th annulus ring contained no projected points (empty) or not (non-empty), and the empty one was denoted as 1 while the non-empty one as 0. Finally, the angular gap fraction of the k-th annulus ring (


P

) was calculated as the weighted ratio of the number of empty trapezoids to the total number of trapezoids in that annulus ring:

438,"In the current study, we developed a lidar-based approach to characterize the attenuation of direct solar radiation along their transmission path as penetrating through a forest canopy. As shown in the Figure 2, for a given direct light beam l with the zenith (Z) and azimuthal (A) angles reaching a given target point 


P

(

x
i

,

y
i

,

z

)

, we could build a 3-D cylindrical buffer (S) region around the light beam l with the radius of r as it penetrates through a forest canopy. The radius r was determined by the sensitivity analysis in Section 2.4. The 3-D cylindrical buffer could be either occupied by points (i.e., “vegetation cluster”) or empty (i.e., “gaps”) resulting from non-random distribution of foliage elements. We projected each point within the buffer S onto the light beam l and computed their one-dimensional distances between each projected point and point 


P
′


 along l (


d

p
′



). The point with the longest 


d

p
′



 was considered as the first contact point between light beams and forest canopy (


P
0


). We then applied the K-Means++ algorithm [54] to group the vegetation points and identify the gaps between foliage elements within the buffer S. The initial number of clusters (k) was set as half of the total number of points (N) within S, and the buffer was considered as an empty one if N was less than 2. Two clusters would be merged if the distance between their boundaries was less than 0.5 m determined by measuring the mean gap size manually. By iteratively clustering all points within the buffer S, we obtained five “vegetation clusters” (


G

~


G
5


) and five “gaps” with varied sizes in the buffer S, respectively.The direct PAR values at the point

 could be obtained if the attenuation effects of direct light beams could be characterized as they penetrate through a forest canopy. By removing the gaps from the buffer S whose total path length is

 by averaging the point volume density of 50 randomly selected spheres with a radius of 0.5 m within tree crowns. For the vegetation clusters with extremely high or low densities along all possible direct beams reaching the target point

 also affect the attenuation effects of direct solar beams. By assuming that the ability to intercept direct solar radiation was inversely related with the distances of each point to the axis of 3-D cylindrical buffer S, we proposed a parameter named “relative point distribution factor (

 values for all observation locations during a daily solar course (Figure 12a) show that both the mean value and standard deviation of keep rising as r becomes larger. This indicates that a larger value of r not only enlarges parameters themselves but also introduces more severe temporal fluctuations to daytime trends of their values. The probability of each parameter in their different value ranges (Figure 12b–d) change greatly as r increases. The spatial buffer built with a small r fails to contain all points that direct light may encounter, bringing large errors to the direct light attenuation model (Figure 5a). These effects can be explained in two aspects. Firstly, if r is not big enough, the two endpoints that make up each discrete vegetation clusters will probably not be the true points that separate foliage elements from gaps and will likely be located inside the canopy. This may cause insufficient clustering of foliage element points, leading to a lower estimated path length. Secondly, if r is close to or smaller than the NPD, points representing foliage elements may be misjudged as isolated noise points and removed by the model. This may cause a deficiency of vegetation clusters, resulting in underestimated parameters. However, the model accuracy will be slightly lower when r exceeds 15 cm (Figure 7a), since the spatial buffer contains many points that are far away from the solar ray and have no impact on the light attenuation. These redundant ""outlying points"" due to oversampling of the canopy, may overestimate the length of vegetation clusters. In models using cubic or pyramidal voxels to represent canopy structure, the level of canopy simplification and the fineness of capturing structure features depend on voxel size. Therefore, it should be properly determined firstly [2,34]. Similarly, it is a primary task to select the width of the “long tube’’ to appropriately sample the vegetation structure and extract the part of the canopy where light attenuation mainly occurs.", 4.

 changes more sharply. This indicates that the existence of gaps between and inside tree crowns results in much instability. Canopy gaps along the ray path originate from leaves clumped around branches. If structural information for continuous canopy cannot be described at the branch level with low density ALS data, total path length and effective path length may not be discriminated clearly. Therefore, variations of direct PAR on a short time scale will be smoothed out. This could explain the result in the previous study that the total path length could capture 92% of PAR variation on a 10-min average time scale [14].

 (Figure 13a,b). Given the general delineation of discontinuous canopy structure on the branch level using UAV-based lidar data, we can trace the frequent movement of tiny sunflecks below canopy during the daytime. Although it is unpractical to acquire leaf number and clumping status using UAV-based lidar data, they can be implicitly expressed by the point density and distribution information. Therefore, incorporating point density and distribution factors might enhance the ability of effective path length to estimate direct light transmittance.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Comparison among Three Different Path Length-Based PAR Models,4
450,"In this study, the appropriate radius for cutting the point cloud (R) in sky diffuse model depends on tree species, distribution patterns, and point density. Furthermore, different optimal values of angle intervals for different annulus rings can guarantee the accuracy and reliability of angular gap fraction estimation and diffuse sky simulation for any lidar point cloud dataset. On the one hand, gap fraction analysis depends on the canopy structure within a certain radius around target locations in the canopy. The changes of SVF and 

P
A

I
e


 with R show opposite “S” type trends (Figure 14a,b), and both of them tend to be steady after R reaches 35 m. It is insufficient for a small R to build a plot containing a substantially complete canopy structure, while a plot built with large R covers redundant points far away from the plot center. These points distribute at the edge of the unit circle. Thus, they have little impact on the distribution pattern of foliage and gaps in the hemisphere space. Most ALS-based models for retrieving canopy structural parameters need to clip the original point cloud using a specific radius ranging from 25 m to 60 m [65,66]. Our diffuse PAR model adopts a projection strategy, but the prerequisite for a clipping radius is consistent with traditional methods based on statistical regression [67,68]. On the other hand, angle intervals are also important for angular gap fraction estimation, since how the unit circle is divided dominates the probability of whether a trapezoid contains projected points. It is acceptable to ignore the uneven distribution of points in the unit projection circle derived from TLS data due to its extremely high point density and precise characterization of foliage structure. However, for UAV-based lidar data, this effect should be considered as a critical factor. Existing studies solve this problem by assigning different sizes to the corresponding pixels in synthetic images according to the position of the projected points in the unit circle [43,44], but this method cannot be applied to the case of no image generation. In this study, we divided different regions of the unit circle with different angular intervals. Figure 14c,d shows the estimation error of 


P

 for each annulus ring varying with one angle interval when the other interval is optimized and R is 35m. The differences in the trends of various annulus rings demonstrate variations of density distribution of projected points in different regions of a unit circle. The lowest value of RMSE for the outermost ring is about 2~3 times larger than that for the other rings. This can be explained by the deviation of the gap distribution between the unit circle and TLS-based synthetic image. UAV lidar fails to capture trunks and other wooden structures at the bottom of the canopy which is located in the outermost ring (Figure 4). In addition, it should be highlighted that the uncertainty may arise when this method is applied to a non-managed system where trees are not uniformly spaced. The difference between

 based on ALS and TLS may increase due to more complex geometric distribution and the mutual occlusion of foliage elements. Therefore, more tests should be done when this method is applied to randomly distributed natural forests.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Sensitivity Analysis of Sky Diffuse PAR Model,4

 in the top three rings still account for 50% and 67% of the total diffuse PAR at 10:00 AM and 12:00 PM, respectively (Figure 15b). It should be noted that at certain locations the normalized difference narrows near noon. This can be explained by the fact that some observation locations (such as No.5) are covered by a large proportion of foliage elements in the vicinity of the zenith direction, obstructing the penetration of a large percent of diffuse sky PAR. Considering that the sky diffuse PAR above canopy reaches its maximum value at noon, the gap distribution and canopy structure within the range of 0~30° zenith angle above one location will dominate the magnitude of sky diffuse PAR reaching that location.", 4. Discussion, 4.4. Effects of Isotropic and Anisotropic Sky Diffuse Distributions,4
452,"Our lidar-based canopy PAR model showed little sensitivity to data point density when parameters were optimized. The model accuracy will only slightly deteriorate as point density decreases. Although point cloud with NPD greater than 5 cm fails to capture the detailed structure of twigs and to effectively separate the vegetation clusters inside the canopy from small gaps, it is still possible to have a comprehensive delineation of large branches and locally clumped foliage. Therefore, large gaps between adjacent canopies that dominate the radiation regime can still be effectively detected by the model. For the direct PAR model, point density determines the optimal radius of spatial ray path buffer. The correlation coefficients of fitting the direct light attenuation model with 

P

L
k


 illustrates that, for data with any point density from origin to NPD of 25 cm, it is possible to find an optimal r to ensure a fitting correlation coefficient above 0.85 (Figure 16a). This result indicates that the developed 3-D canopy ray trace model has great stability and good applicability to the direct light attenuation model in a large range of point density. For the sky diffuse PAR model, point density determines the optimal values of zenith and azimuth angle intervals to segment the unit circle. Assuming a 90 m radius of the unit projection circle, the variation range of

 based on data with different NPD levels is evidently larger in annulus rings with a low zenith angle (Figure 16b). This phenomenon can be explained by the uneven distribution characteristics of projected points in different annulus rings. The compression(expansion) effect in regions with a low(high) zenith angle enhances(weakens) the impact of point density variation. Moreover, the largest difference between 




A
k


¯


 for all annulus rings is confined to 0.2 m2 with point density ranging from origin to NPD of 10cm. This indicates that only when point density is reduced to a certain extent, will the size of optimal angular interval alter significantly. To summarize, we recommend selecting an appropriate point density on the basis of different tree species, canopy morphology, and spatial distribution patterns in order to achieve a balance between model accuracy and efficiency.", 4. Discussion, 4.5. Effects of Point Density,4
453,"The newly developed PAR model is superior in the following aspects. (1) The 3D ray trace model can intuitively calculate the total ray path length or effective path length at a particular moment with great accuracy. To estimate direct light transmittance, only the original lidar point cloud is needed and other raster or vector data is not required. Many spatially explicit canopy light models based on lidar data adopt a voxelization procedure to the entire canopy to track the geometric relationship between a light ray and voxels with return points contained inside [2,14,42]. However, through these methods, the selection of voxel size and the voxel itself will reduce the accuracy of path length calculation to some extent. This problem can be avoided in our ray trace model. (2) Accurate estimation of angular gap fraction for each annulus ring can be obtained, and thus can be perfectly combined with anisotropic sky diffuse distribution in the sky diffuse PAR model. TLS derived synthetic images were used as a substitution for hemispherical photographs as reference data (Figure 4). Although these two methods observe canopy structure in a similar way [69], TLS data obtained from a 3-D perspective is more stable than the fisheye photograph in extracting canopy structural parameters [70]. Meanwhile, several sources of error related to acquiring and processing hemispherical photographs can be avoided. These sources include light environment and exposure settings during shooting, threshold selection for separating canopy and sky pixels, accurate georeference of observation locations, and height deviation between the camera and observation locations [69,71]. (3) Our model has expanded traditional methods based on hemispherical photographs to large-scale applications with great flexibility. The temporal variation of PAR at any location is easily available, which can support ecological models focusing on soil temperature, water content and snowmelt dynamics [19,72]. Since the canopy PAR model simulates PAR pointwise, the sampling density can be flexibly selected according to the size of study area and the degree of horizontal heterogeneity to improve processing efficiency.There are several sources of error in simulating PAR. The primary one is derived from the occlusion effect of laser beams. Although UAV can easily densify data points by overlapping flight paths in different directions, the occlusion effect in the dense canopy is still inevitable [48,73]. It can be effectively eliminated by changing the flight path direction or increasing the scan angle, but the influence of scan angles on the inversion of canopy structural parameters should also be considered [34]. UAV should maintain stable speed and uniformity of flight path during scanning to avoid uneven distribution of point density. The difference in data acquisition methods is the posterior source of model error. UAV-based lidar provides a relatively complete depiction of the upper part of the canopy structure, while it fails to obtain a comprehensive description to the bottom part, especially for the woody components. On the contrary, TLS or a fisheye camera scans the upper hemisphere space based on a location below the canopy. They can capture the precise understory structural information but lack the morphological description for the upper part of the canopy [44,48]. When using hemispherical photographs or TLS-based synthetic images as reference, many woody components such as trunks, low branches, and shrubs are included, which will influence the estimation of canopy structural parameters [73]. As shown in Figure 4, after point projection, this difference is relatively limited in the region with a low zenith angle and more pronounced at regions with a high zenith angle. This error can be limited by removing the outermost ring or increasing point density. In addition, transforming the 3-D point cloud to a 2-D plane by projection will result in some loss of partial canopy structure information. Subjectivity remains when selecting appropriate binary image resolution after TLS point cloud projection and may bring some error to sky diffuse PAR estimation.Hemispherical photographs or TLS derived synthetic images is necessary in the sky diffuse PAR model as reference data for angular gap fraction estimation. TLS data used in our study has several advantages mentioned above. Nevertheless, hemispherical photography is faster, cheaper, and easier to process, especially when the spatial coverage is huge. We recommend that a reasonable choice should be made according to the coverage of study area and cost. The direct PAR and sky diffuse PAR reaching an arbitrary location in the canopy are dominated by return points around that location and the ray path respectively. Under the premise that the point cloud can describe canopy structure substantially and completely, the modelled subcanopy PAR is determined by the optimal model parameters selected manually. Values of these parameter are not universal or constant but need adjusting according to tree species, canopy distribution patterns, and data point density. Therefore, this model is supposed to be further tested in more comprehensive conditions. Moreover, topography should be considered in this model for further direction.", 4. Discussion, 4.6. Model Evaluation,4
454,"We proposed a novel spatially-explicit canopy PAR model according to UAV-based lidar data to simulate spatiotemporal distributions of PAR within or under a discontinuous broad-leaved forest canopy. The study compared direct PAR simulated by three light path length-based parameters and sky diffuse PAR simulated under conditions of isotropic and anisotropic sky diffuse distribution. The effects of data point density on model parameterization and accuracy were also discussed. For a discontinuous canopy, the effective path length of light passing through foliage elements is a feasible and powerful parameter to capture the spatiotemporal variations of total PAR along a light transmission path. In addition, incorporating point density and spatial distribution factors will further improve the accuracy of final estimation. However, the total path length fails to capture direct light variation on a five-minute time scale. In the meantime, the estimated sky diffuse PAR is up to 17% higher at noon and 10% lower at sunrise or sunset by assuming the anisotropic sky diffuse distribution rather than the isotropic sky diffuse distribution. The point density has a limited impact on model accuracy as long as parameters are determined as their optimal values. The developed canopy PAR model can be combined with ecological or hydrological models to solve plot- and stand-scale issues such as vegetation succession, soil respiration and subcanopy snowmelt, and it provides a foundation for the study of biophysical and biochemical processes (photosynthesis, transpiration, fluorescence, etc.) at the watershed level.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
455,"Monitoring crop growth status efficiently and in a non-destructive way is necessary for precision crop management [1]. Aboveground biomass (AGB) and leaf area index (LAI) are important growth parameters with which to evaluate crop growth status [2,3]. Both have been applied to describe the canopy structure of plants and to predict grain yield [4]. In addition, AGB and LAI have been reported to affect the global carbon cycle and climate change [5,6]. It is therefore critical to efficiently and rapidly measure crop AGB and LAI.As a developing approach, remote sensing technology has been successfully used for crop growth monitoring in recent decades [1,7,8]; examples are its use as a satellite-based platform, manned airborne platform and in ground-based spectral devices. However, several limitations still apply for these platforms. Satellite-based platforms are restrained by deficient spatio-temporal resolution and cloud cover, manned airborne platforms have relatively high operating costs and ground-based spectral devices are laborious and suffer from inefficient operation [9,10,11]. In comparison, rapid-developed unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms provide an economical and high-efficiency approach to meet the continuously growing demands for improved spatial, temporal and spectral resolutions [10,11,12].Among UAV-based crop monitoring studies, sensors have typically been multispectral and hyperspectral cameras that target biomass estimation, LAI monitoring or grain yield prediction [1,13,14]. In recent years, UAV-based multispectral images were used to estimate the rice growth status and predict grain yield. For example, Devia et al. used seven vegetation indices, combined with multivariable regressions to monitor agronomy parameters at different rice growth stages [15]. Duan et al. integrated UAV-based vegetation indices (VIs) and abundance information obtained from spectral mixture analysis to improve the prediction accuracy of rice yield at the heading stage [16]. In addition, most UAV-based studies used multi-rotor UAVs due to their high stability, superior image quality and good controllability. However, many multi-rotor UAVs do not meet the requirements of large-scale crop monitoring with regard to flight speeds and flight duration [10]. In contrast, most fixed-wing UAVs can fly at high speeds and usually have a long flight duration; however, the flight speeds are too fast to capture high-quality images and the operation is more complicated than that of multi-rotor UAVs [17]. As a result, little attention has been directed to fixed-wing UAVs in the field of crop monitoring.In addition to different remote sensing platforms, scholars have also used various retrieval methods to quantitatively retrieve crop growth parameters [18,19,20]. These methods can generally be divided into two categories: empirical and physical [21]. With advantages of higher computational efficiency and lower instrumental requirements, empirical methods have been more widely applied than physical methods [21]. Furthermore, although empirical methods are commonly established via parametric regression, non-parametric regression is used more frequently, such as artificial neural network (ANN) and random forest (RF) regression models. ANN regression models have been successfully applied to estimate crop properties, such as crop biomass [18], LAI [19] and foliage nitrogen concentrations [22]. A range of studies used the RF regression model to map crop attributes, for example, biomass retrieval [23], LAI retrieval [24] and nitrogen status monitoring [25].While empirical methods have been widely applied and extended, the empirical regression relationship still cannot control deviation from many secondary experimental factors and its parameters are condition specific [26,27,28]. A review by Corti et al. indicated that the factors (e.g., crop growth stage, sensor type, acquisition mode, sensed target and spatial resolution) exert different effects on the performance of maize variables estimation; furthermore, the estimation models have different forms and performance in response to different factors [26]. Kang et al. also suggested that the relationship between LAI and VI is not unique, especially in the agricultural setting but rather represented by a family of equations as a function of the specific geographical, biological and environmental setting [27]. In addition, other plant-related factors were found to affect canopy reflectance (e.g., plant species, development stage, age and site); however, the empirical regressions did not take these factors into account [28,29]. These issues have been identified as major limitation for the wide application of the empirical method. A powerful approach is needed to generalize empirical relationships to fit global samples across different crop types and growth stages.The mixed-effect model might provide new insights for the development of universal models for crop growth parameters estimation. The mixed-effect model can quantify the relationships between explanatory variables and response variables by breaking down the regression into both fixed effects and random effects. Fixed effects represent the global relationship between explanatory and response variables, while random effects represent the deviations from the global relationships within each group that are only associated with membership to a particular group [30]. The normal global y = f(x) relationship only takes the effects of explanatory variables to the regression into account, while overlooking the effects of other relevant factors (e.g., site, growth stage and cultivar type). The mixed-effect model also addresses the hierarchical nature of the data by incorporating plot or stand-level variations in the model [31,32]. Due to these advantages, the mixed-effect model has been extensively adopted in the field of forest remote sensing during recent years, with a particular focus on forest biomass estimation with LiDAR data [31,32,33]. Poudel et al. [32] combined linear mixed-effect (LME) models with multi-temporal LiDAR data to estimate changes of aboveground biomass and cubic volume. The authors grouped 78 plots into five plot types based on basal area per hectare in the given plots and the plot type was used as random effect. The estimation based on LME models was more accurate than that based on the differences in LiDAR-based estimates.This study was conducted to explore the potential of mixed-effect models for estimating rice growth parameters based on the superiority of mixed-effect models to address uncertainty. Thus, the objectives of this study were to, (1) evaluate the potential of the fixed-wing UAV for crop monitoring; (2) estimate rice AGB and LAI by combining a LME model with spectral information derived from UAV multispectral images; (3) compare the performance of different retrieval methods (simple regression (SR), ANN, RF, LME) to estimate rice AGB and LAI. The result is promising to provide technical support for the monitoring of the crop growth status over large-scale farmland based on the UAV remote sensing platform.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
456,"Field experiments were conducted in two consecutive years (2017–2018) at the experimental station of the Taizhou National Modern Agriculture Demonstration Area located in Taizhou City, Jiangsu Province, China (119°89′E, 33°08′N) (Figure 1). Experiments were conducted with different N rates, planting patterns and rice cultivars (Table 1). In 2017, the experiment used four N rates and three planting patterns with two rice cultivars. In 2018, the experiment used four N rates and two planting methods with two rice cultivars. The distribution of total N at different growth stages was 30% before the transplanting stage, 20% at the tillering stage, 30% at the jointing stage and 20% at the booting stage.Thirty-five ground control points (GCPs) were built and monitored in the study area (Figure 1) to enable georeferencing of the UAV data. These were set up using circular panels with a 50 cm diameter. The center of each panel was measured using the Trimble GeoExplorer 6000 Series GeoXH (Trimble Navigation, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The estimated accuracy of the GCPs was 2.5 cm in horizontal coordinates and 4 cm in longitudinal coordinates.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area and Experimental Details,2
457,"Ground destructive sampling was conducted just after the UAV campaigns at key rice growth stages (Table 1). For each plot, three hills were randomly selected from different positions in the sampling area (Figure 1) of the plot, the tiller number of which equaled the average tiller number of the plot at the corresponding growth stage. The average tiller number was determined by averaging the tiller number of 20 random hills in the sampling area at corresponding growth stages [34]. Plants were manually uprooted and separated into different organs (leaf, stem and panicle) to determine the dry matter content of different organs.LAI were immediately measured by using a Li-3000c leaf area meter (Li-Cor., Lincoln, NE, USA) to scan the area of separated fresh green leaves. Based on Equation (1), the LAI of the rice population was calculated to represent the LAI of each plot [35].

458,"Aerial images were collected using a commercially available fixed-wing eBee SQ UAV (senseFly, Cheseaux-Lausanne, Switzerland) equipped with a compact multispectral Parrot Sequoia sensor (MicaSense, Seattle, WA, USA) (Figure 2). The eBee SQ is a hand-launched, autonomous, flying aircraft that consists of a rigid wing and an electric motor-driven pusher propeller. The maximum flight duration of the eBee SQ (equipped with multispectral sensor) is approximately 55 min during which it can cover a maximum area of about 80 ha (spatial resolution of 8 cm, both forward and lateral image overlaps of 70%). SenseFly’s eMotion software was used to develop the eBee SQ flight plan beforehand and to monitor the flight using a laptop; for more detailed information, please refer to the method described by Chianucci et al. [36]. The Parrot Sequoia sensor consists of five channels, which include a 16 megapixel rolling shutter RGB camera with a 4608 × 3456 pixel resolution and four 1.5 megapixel global-shutter single band cameras at 1280 × 960 pixel resolution in the following spectral bands: green (wavelength = 550 nm, bandwidth = 40 nm), red (wavelength = 660 nm, bandwidth = 40 nm), red edge (wavelength = 735 nm, bandwidth = 10 nm) and near infrared (NIR, wavelength = 790 nm, bandwidth = 40 nm). Radiometric calibration images of the Parrot Sequoia camera were captured on the ground before each flight, using a calibrated reflectance panel (MicaSense) [37]. The Parrot Sequoia camera also depends on a sunshine sensor to automatically adjust the readings to ambient light to minimize error during image capture [38]. Absolute positioning was directly recorded with a georeferencing method using the position/attitude measurements derived from the UAV-embedded GPS/IMU instruments [36].Flights were conducted at five sampling stages for 2017 and six sampling stages for 2018 during the growing seasons (Table 1). Images were collected in TIFF format with the camera set to automatic mode under stable ambient and clear-sky conditions between 10:00 am and 2:00 pm. The ground pixel resolution was set to 8 cm, corresponding to a flight altitude of about 80 m. The forward and lateral image overlaps were both set to 70%.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. UAV Image Acquisition,2
459,"After each flight, five image sets were produced: one multispectral image sets each in the green, red, red edge and NIR bands and one RGB image set. Only the four multispectral image sets were selected because VIs and four monochrome image reflectance were needed for this study. Pix4D mapper 4.2 (Pix4D S.A., Lausanne, Switzerland) was used to generate the orthomosaic. The key steps of orthomosaic generation using Pix4D mapper comprised camera alignment, geo-referencing, radiometric calibration, orthomosaic and generating VI maps. 35 GCPs in the Pix4D project were used to georeference the study area, increase the global accuracy and decrease band-to-band misalignment. Reflectance calibration was conducted by using radiometric calibration images with known reflectance values provided by MicaSense. Eight VI maps were produced by using the index calculator of the Pix4D mapper. These VIs are listed in Table 3 and are commonly used for AGB and LAI estimation [39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47].With ENVI 5.3 (Exelis Visual Information Solutions, Boulder, CO, USA), the non-sampling area (Figure 1) of each plot in one orthomosaic image was manually outlined as a “Region of Interest” to extract the average VI. The descriptive statistics of all VIs are show in Table 4.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Processing of UAV Spectral Images,2
460,"To improve the applicability of the regression model, the data obtained from the two years of experiments were used to examine the relationships between remote sensing variables and AGB or LAI. Four models (SR, ANN, RF and LME) were used to quantify the relationship between remote sensing variables and AGB or LAI. Of these methods, SR is a parametric regression model and the others are non-parametric regression models. All analyses were respectively performed within three growth stage groups, that is, the whole season, pre-heading stages (stages before heading) and post-heading stages (stages after heading). 2.5.1. Baseline Retrieval MethodsIn this study, three baseline retrieval methods for crop monitoring (SR, ANN and RF) were used for AGB and LAI retrieval. The statistical analyses for SR and ANN were performed using SPSS 25.0 software (SPSS, IBM, IL, USA) while RF was executed in R.3.2.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Plots were created in GraphPad Prism 6.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).SR models include both linear and nonlinear (exponential) regression models.

where the independent variable x represents the explanatory variable (VI), the dependent variable y represents the response variables (AGB and LAI) and parameters a0, a1, b0 and b1 are estimated by minimizing the least square error. The performance of various regression models is assessed by comparing their coefficient of determination (R2) (Equation (8)) and root mean square error (RMSE) (Equation (9)).The ANN regression model is based on a gradient learning method, which can realize strong nonlinear mapping between input and output [19]. ANN contains a large number of processing elements (neurons), which are arranged in different layers in a network: an input layer, an output layer and one or more hidden layers [18]. In this study, the number of hidden layers was set to 1. The number of neurons was modified by repeating the setting. Via cross-validation, the coefficient of determination (R2) (Equation (8)) and root mean square error (RMSE) (Equation (9)) from test samples were compared. After comparing the values of R2 and RMSE, the most appropriate numbers were obtained. The scaled conjugate gradient was also selected as training algorithm. Figure 3 shows a schematic of the initial neural network model.The RF model is derived from the classification tree algorithm and can be used for both classification or regression [48]. An RF model has two parameters: the number of decision trees (Ntree) and the minimum number of observations per tree leaf (mtry). In this research, the RF regression model used relevant parameters that were reported in prior studies, Ntree was set to 500 and mtry was set to 2 for the whole season and different stage groups [19,24]. 2.5.2. Linear Mixed-effect ModelThe LME model was also used for AGB and LAI retrieval. The LME model was executed using SPSS 25.0 software (SPSS) while plots were created using Graph-Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The LME incorporates two parameters: fixed and random effects [49]. The fixed effects are parameters that are associated with an entire population or with certain repeatable levels of experimental factors; the random effects are parameters associated with individual experimental units drawn at random from the population [30]. The form of the LME model is given by:

I represents the identity matrix (diagonal matrix of 1s). ε is not correlated with the random effect u, that is, Cov(u, ε) = 0.Simultaneous estimates of correlation parameters (i.e., σs, h, ϕ and τ) and fixed effect coefficients (i.e., β) were obtained by restricted (or residual) maximum likelihood estimation (REML) [50], to reflect the loss of degrees of freedom due to the estimation of the fixed effects coefficients [51]. For both AGB and LAI models, the reflectance of four spectral bands (green, red, red-edge and NIR) were set as fixed effects for the whole season and different stage groups. Random effects have different choices, including three individual factors: cultivar (C, which is a factor variable with two types), planting pattern (P, which is a factor variable with three types), growth stage (S, which is a factor variable with seven types) and their combinations (CP, CS, PS and CSP). The rice population structure is an important indicator for rice growth and rice with the same population structure is relatively homogeneous. These three individual factors (C, S and P) contribute strongly to the formation of rice population and were selected as candidates of random effects [52,53]. Moreover, with these random effects, more group combinations and dataset with greater variability were utilized to improve the robustness of the LAI/AGB models in this study.With different random effects, Z and u have different dimensions. For instance, if cultivar and growth stage (CS) are set as random effects, the data will be broken down into 2 × 7 = 14 groups, where Z will be a N × 14 design matrix and u will be a 14 × 1 vector of the random effects.

464,"AGB and LAI are the major growth indicators for the monitoring of the rice growth status. Figure 4 shows the relationships between rice AGB and VIs that are generally used for biomass estimation; the best-fit form of the curve is an exponential regression. For the whole season, NDRE and DATT both performed best amongst all VIs and explained 68% of the variability in AGB (Figure 4b,g). For pre-heading stages, NDRE, CIRE and DATT achieved better performance (R2 > 0.70, RMSE < 2.29 t ha−1, Figure 4b,c,g) than other VIs (R2: 0.51–0.57, RMSE: 3.12–3.39 t ha−1). However, for post-heading stages, all selected VIs were weakly related to AGB with the highest R2 values of 0.25 and the lowest RMSE values of 3.49 t ha−1 (DATT).Figure 5 shows the relationships between LAI and VIs that are commonly used for LAI estimation. The best curve form is also the exponential regression. For the whole season, NDRE, GNDVI and CIRE outperformed other VIs, with R2 values ranging from 0.72–0.74 and RMSE values ranging from 1.46–1.59 (Figure 5b,c,d). For pre-heading stages, NDRE performed best and explained 76% variability in LAI (Figure 5b). Other VIs achieved good performance with R2 values ranging from 0.66–0.74 and RMSE values ranging from 1.33–1.70 except for MTVI1 (Figure 5h). For post-heading stages, all selected VIs had weaker relationships with LAI compared to other stage groups, with highest R2 values of 0.56 and lowest RMSE values of 1.60.VIs extracted from multispectral images explained the variability of AGB and LAI for the whole season and pre-heading stages, while the relationships between AGB and LAI with the VIs were relatively poor for post-heading stages.", 3. Results, 3.1. Relationships between AGB and LAI with VIs Extracted from Multispectral Images,3
465,"It is critical to identify appropriate model parameters with which to develop the monitoring model. In the ANN model, numbers from 3 to 30 neurons were attempted and the optimal parameter was obtained when R2 reached a maximum and the RMSE reached a minimum on test dataset via cross validation. The parameters for the final models (ANN and RF) are shown in Table 5.Different random effect combinations and their RMSE values are shown in Figure 6. Optimal random effects were determined by comparing RMSE value results. For the LME model of AGB (Figure 6a), the CSP (i.e., the combination of cultivar, planting method and growth stage) resulted in the minimum RMSE for the whole season and for different stage groups. For the LME model of LAI (Figure 6b), the CSP combination resulted in minimum RMSE values for the whole season and different stage groups. As a result, the combination of cultivar, planting method and growth stage was set as random effects for both AGB and LAI models.", 3. Results," 3.2. Determination of Model Parameters for ANN, RF and LME Models",3
466,"The LME model was applied to estimate both rice AGB and LAI and a comparative analysis between the LME model and the other three frequently-used models (including a parametric regression model (SR) and two non-parametric regression models (ANN and RF)) was conducted using k-fold (k = 10) cross-validation.For AGB estimation, Figure 7 displays scatter diagrams of measured AGB values versus estimated values derived from SR (with the best performing VI), ANN, RF and LME models for whole season and different stage groups. For the whole season, SR produced the highest estimation accuracy using DATT, with R2 and RMSE values of 0.54 and 3.55 t ha−1, respectively (Figure 7a). ANN and RF outperformed SR with respective R2 values of 0.75 and 0.70 and RMSE values of 2.63 t ha−1 and 2.86 t ha−1 (Figure 7d,g). The LME model significantly improved estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 1.75 t ha−1) (Figure 7j) and was superior to other models. For the pre-heading stages, SR achieved the highest estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.71 and RMSE = 2.10 t ha−1) using DATT (Figure 7b). Compared to SR, slight improvements were obtained by ANN (R2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 1.80 t ha−1) (Figure 7e) and RF (R2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 2.03 t ha−1) (Figure 7h). Moreover, the LME model achieved moderate improvements with R2 and RMSE values of 0.86 and 1.49 t ha−1, respectively (Figure 7k). For the post-heading stages, SR had the highest estimation accuracy using DATT but remained low (R2 = 0.22 and RMSE = 3.49 t ha−1) (Figure 7c). In contrast, ANN and RF outperformed SR, with respective R2 values of 0.54 and 0.40 and RMSE values of 2.69 t ha−1 and 3.06 t ha−1 (Figure 7f,i). The LME model significantly improved the AGB estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 1.97 t ha−1) (Figure 7l) compared to the other tested models. Therefore, the LME model is suggested as a promising model for improving AGB estimation for all growth stages.For LAI estimation, Figure 8 shows the scatter diagrams for measured LAI values versus estimated values derived from SR (with the best performing VI), ANN, RF and LME models for the whole season and for different stage groups. For the whole season, SR achieved the highest estimation accuracy using NDRE, with R2 and RMSE values of 0.66 and 1.45, respectively (Figure 8a). In contrast, ANN and RF slightly increased estimation accuracy, with respective R2 values of 0.74 and 1.27, RMSE values of 1.27 and 1.36 (Figure 8d,g). The LME model yielded more accurate estimation results than the other models (R2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 1.15) (Figure 8j). For pre-heading stages, SR achieved the highest estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 1.25) using NDRE (Figure 8b). The accuracies of ANN and RF were approximately equal to that of SR, with respective R2 values of 0.75 and 0.74 and RMSE values of 1.19 and 1.22 (Figure 8e,h). In contrast, the LME model outperformed the other models (R2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 1.04) (Figure 8k). For post-heading stages, SR achieved the highest estimation accuracy using CIRE, with respective R2 and RMSE values of 0.53 and 1.59 (Figure 8c). ANN and RF slightly improved the estimation accuracy, with respective R2 values of 0.58 and 0.56 and RMSE values of 1.49 and 1.53 (Figure 8f,i). The LME model yielded the most accurate estimation across all models (R2 = 0.76 and RMSE = 1.16) (Figure 8l). Therefore, the LME model performed better in estimating rice LAI.In addition, although the LME model improved the estimation accuracy of both AGB and LAI, their degree of improvement differed. For AGB estimation, compared to SR (Figure 7a–c), the R2 of the LME model increased by 0.35 for the whole season, by 0.15 for the pre-heading stages and by 0.53 for the post-heading stages, while the corresponding RMSE values decreased by 1.8 t ha−1, 0.61 t ha−1 and 1.52 t ha−1, respectively (Figure 7j–l). For LAI estimation, compared to SR (Figure 8a–c), the LME model R2 increased by 0.13 for the whole season, by 0.08 for the pre-heading stages and by 0.23 for the post-heading stages; corresponding RMSE values decreased by 0.30, 0.21 and 0.43, respectively (Figure 8j–l). Consequently, the LME model may be more suitable for rice AGB estimation.", 3. Results, 3.3. Comparative Analysis of Four Models Based on Predictive Capability,3
467,"It is necessary to analyze the results for all combinations of random effects to evaluate the predictive capability within the groups of LME models. Practical application should be expanded on; the results show that the method can be used to make predictions within a single known group as well as across multiple different groups. Groupings do not have to be CSP and it is not the optimal choice for the random effects. Furthermore, similar results were obtained from the LME model of AGB (Figure 9 and Figure 10) and that of LAI (Figure 11 and Figure 12). The analysis was conducted based on the LME model of the AGB.Figure 9 shows the scatter diagrams for measured AGB values versus estimated values derived from LME models, which were built with different random effects. From the overall performance of modelling, CSP (the combination of cultivar, growth stage and planting pattern) performed best (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 1.75 t ha−1) (Figure 9g). Models that included random effects of growth stage (S) obtained higher prediction accuracy (R2: 0.84–0.89, RMSE: 1.75–2.12 t ha−1) (Figure 9c,e,f,g) than other models. In particular, the LME model only used growth stage as random effect and obtained satisfactory estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 2.12 t ha−1) (Figure 9c). Therefore, growth stage could be an important factor for the rice LME model.In addition, Figure 9 shows the modelling performance within the groups of LME models. The results indicate that models, which were segmented into more groups (number of groups ≥ 7) obtained higher prediction accuracy (R2: 0.84–0.89, RMSE: 1.75–2.12 t ha−1) (Figure 9c,e,f,g). In contrast, models with fewer groups (number of groups < 7) performed worse (R2: 0.72–0.75, RMSE: 2.60–2.77 t ha−1) (Figure 9a,b,d). This indicates that segmentation of the data inherently improved the results because it learned the mean of the segment; consequently, adding the number of groups could increase prediction accuracy. As shown in Figure 9 and Figure 10, the LME models using C, P or CP as random effects achieved a similar performance within groups to overall model performance (C: R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 2.72 t ha−1; P: R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 2.77 t ha−1; CP: R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 2.60 t ha−1), with average R2 of 0.70, 0.72 and 0.71 and average RMSE of 2.72 t ha−1, 2.77 t ha−1 and 2.60 t ha−1, respectively (Figure 9a,b,d, Figure 10a,b). These models have fewer groups and the highest number of groups is only six (CP). For LME models with more segments (i.e., the models using S, CS and PS as random effects), the model performance within groups was poorer than the overall model performance (S: R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 2.12 t ha−1; CS: R2 = 0.86, RMSE = 1.93 t ha−1; PS: R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 2.04 t ha−1), with average R2 of 0.61, 0.60 and 0.61 and average RMSE of 1.82 t ha−1, 1.66 t ha−1 and 1.88 t ha−1, respectively (Figure 9c,e,f, Figure 10a,b). Still, these models successfully yielded predictions within the groups, since almost all R2 values of groups ranged from 0.4–0.9 (average R2 > 0.60) (Figure 10a,b). This indicated that the LME model offered advantages beyond simply learning the mean of the segment. With regard to the LME model using CSP, the R2 and RMSE within the groups fluctuated greatly, with R2: 0.1–0.87, RMSE: 0.38–2.86 t ha−1 (Figure 10a). The result could be ascribed to the fact that the data were segmented into too many groups (number of groups = 36) when using CSP as random effects. Therefore, the number of points per group was very low (i.e., 12–24) and the modelling performance within the groups suffered from randomness and strong uncertainty. Even though the LME model (using CSP) achieved good performance over all data, this approach would lose statistical significance and simply yield the mean for the group. Consequently, for the practical application of the LME model, the CSP may be not suitable as the random effects given model generalizability. LME models with fewer segments might be promising alternatives, such as the models using S, CS or PS.", 3. Results, 3.4. Comparison of LME Models with Different Random Effects,3
468,"A low-altitude UAV platform is an affordable and precise tool for the mapping of crop traits and can meet the central requirements of spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions [10]. Among various UAVs, the multi-rotor UAV has been increasingly employed in recent years due to its high stability, superior image quality and good controllability (easy take-off and landing) [17]. Nevertheless, high stability can be a double-edged sword: it provides high quality images but it also limits the multi-rotor UAV flight speed and duration [17]. As an illustration, a multi-rotor UAV required approximately 10 min to cover 1 ha (30–50 m flight altitude) for dynamic wheat NDVI monitoring [9]. Zhang et al. [54] monitored field crop conditions with a multi-rotor UAV (Aeryon Labs Inc., Waterloo, Canada), which has a maximum flight duration of 25 min and can cover close to 10 ha (120 m flight altitude) per battery charge. Compared to a multi-rotor UAV for crop monitoring, fixed-wing UAVs are competitive because they are more efficient and can cover larger areas [17]. For example, a fixed-wing UAV covered an area of 148 ha within 45 min and achieved a total flight duration of up to 60 min [55]. The fixed-wing UAV used in this study was able to cover about 80 ha with a maximum duration of 55 min (80 m flight altitude). A comparison of the flight efficiency for both types of UAVs is shown in Table 6.This study used an advanced fixed-wing UAV with a compact multispectral sensor Parrot Sequoia to monitor the crop growth status. The fixed-wing has a good flight control system and creates a relatively stable flight attitude. It can also withstand strong wind speeds of up to 12 m s−1. With regard to the SR (most commonly used) validation results, a moderate result (R2 = 0.54 and RMSE = 3.55 t ha−1 from DATT) was obtained for AGB for the whole season and a better result was obtained for LAI for the whole season, with respective R2 and RMSE values of 0.66 and 1.45. Compared to the estimation models based on multi-rotor UAVs (e.g., the best AGB results acquired by best performing VI (R2 = 0.55, RMSE = 2.77 t ha−1) by Zheng et al. [57] and the best LAI model produced by a three-band vegetation index modified triangular vegetation index (MTVI2) with respective R2 and relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) values of 0.80 and 24% reported by Yao et al. [11]), the results obtained with the fixed-wing UAV in this study were relatively reliable.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Advantages of Fixed-Wing UAVs,4
469,"SR has been widely used to explore the relationship between crop growth parameters and VIs, which resulted in the development of a large number of multispectral VIs [11,58,59]. In this study, both for the whole season and pre-heading stages, most VIs that consisted of the NIR and the red edge bands outperformed the other indices both for AGB (e.g., NDRE, CIRE and DATT) and LAI (e.g., NDRE) estimation, which was consistent with previous studies by Li et al. [58] and Zheng et al. [13]. This might be because the canopy reflectance is largely dominated by canopy-structure-related parameters (e.g., LAI and biomass) during the early growth stages. VIs that consist of the NIR and the red edge bands are also sensitive to the canopy structure and therefore performed better than other models [13,60,61]. However, for post-heading stages, most of the selected VIs were weakly related to the growth parameters, especially for AGB (R2 < 0.30, RMSE > 3.49 t ha−1). This issue was also encountered in previous studies [14,57] and may be caused by the fact that the NIR and red edge had poor sensitivity to the large biomass during the late stages of crop growth [14,60]. Furthermore, other factors interfered, such as senescent leaves and panicles [57].Many approaches have been proposed that improve the estimation accuracy for post-heading stages, including the application of three-dimensional information coupled with crop height and hyperspectral information [14] and the combination of texture and spectral information from a UAV image to construct an AGB estimation model [57]. In addition, several studies have also tried to mine information from hyperspectral data: Yao et al. [62] applied continuous wavelet transform to hyperspectral data to improve the estimation accuracy of canopy leaf biomass. However, the models need additional information for these methods and data processing can be tedious and time-consuming (e.g., hyperspectral data). This study applied the LME model to improve the estimation accuracy for post-heading stages. For AGB estimation, the R2 of the LME model increased by 0.53 compared to SR, while corresponding RMSE values decreased by 1.52 t ha−1. For LAI estimation, the R2 of LME model increased by 0.23 compared to SR, while corresponding RMSE values decreased by 0.43. The results indicated the LME model as an efficient approach to improve the estimation accuracy for post-heading stages.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Relationship between Growth Parameters and Vegetation Indices,4
470,"As a promising method, the mixed-effect model has been extensively applied for forest remote sensing [31,32,33]. Compared to other models, the mixed-effect model can better deal with data that are hierarchically structured and grouped [31,32,63]. This model could explain these complex and independent data by breaking down the regression into fixed effects and random effects [49]. The random effects are able to model the deviations from the global relationship within each group [30]. Furthermore, several common types of mixed-effect models exist, including linear mixed-effect (LME) models, generalized linear mixed-effect (GLME) models and non-linear mixed-effect (NLME) models [32,33,64]. Of these types, the LME model is the most popular since it has a better generalization capability; therefore, it was selected for this study [63]. To determine whether the LME model is able to accurately estimate crop growth parameters, the LME model was tested in this study. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the predictive capability was performed between the LME model and the other three baseline retrieval methods (SR, ANN and RF).For AGB estimation, the LME model outperformed all other models (SR, ANN and RF) both for the whole season and for different stage groups. For the whole season, a significant improvement was recorded (R2 = 0.89 and RMSE = 1.75 t ha−1). Compared to the results of coupling crop height with hyperspectral information (R2 = 0.74 and RMSE = 1.20 t ha−1) by Yue et al. [14] and combining texture and spectral information from UAV images (R2 = 0.78 and RMSE = 1.84 t ha−1) by Zheng et al. [57], the LME model achieved fairly satisfactory performance. This could be explained by the fact that the growth parameters (AGB or LAI) were not completely independent because the growth parameters might aggregate within different experimental factors (e.g., the random terms in this study: cultivar, planting method and growth stage); thus, these variables were more or less similar. The LME model resolved the data aggregation issue, while traditional retrieval methods did not. Forest research has faced the same challenge because the relationship between volume and biomass with LiDAR metrics differs by stands; therefore, the mixed-effect model is preferable to other models because it addresses the hierarchical nature of forest data by incorporating plot or stand level variability [32]. For each stage group, improvements were moderate for the pre-heading stages (R2 = 0.86 and RMSE = 1.49 t ha−1) and significant for the post-heading stages (R2 = 0.75 and RMSE = 1.97 t ha−1). This may be a result of AGB consisting of leaf, stem and panicle biomass after the heading stage. The biomass differences between different organs are more significant, which leads to a more obvious hierarchical nature and aggregation of biological data. This further supports the advantage of the LME model in dealing with hierarchically structured data [63].With regard to LAI estimation, the ANN and RF regression models showed limited improvements for all stages compared to the SR (whole season: R2 = 0.66 and RMSE = 1.45; pre-heading stages: R2 = 0.73 and RMSE = 1.25; post-heading stages: R2 = 0.53 and RMSE = 1.59). Compared to other models, the LME model achieved a better performance for the whole season (R2 = 0.79 and RMSE = 1.15) and pre-heading stages (R2 = 0.81 and RMSE = 1.04) and a significant improvement was recorded found for the post-heading stages (R2 = 0.76 and RMSE = 1.16). However, the improvements of LAI estimation were not as significant as those of AGB estimation for the post-heading stages. It might be because AGB data aggregation is more palpable than LAI under these random effects. Thus, the LME model was more appropriate for crop AGB estimation.These results showed that the LME model performs well for rice growth parameters estimation; however, the LME models with different random effects still need to be compared to apply them to practical agricultural production. As shown with the comparison of linear mixed-effect models with different random effects, the combination of cultivar, planting pattern and growth stage performed best (R2 = 0.89, RMSE = 1.75 t ha−1). However, further analysis suggested that part of the reason for its superiority is that it is segmented into most groups and thus benefits from obtaining the mean of the group. The models that include the random effect of the growth stage also obtained better prediction accuracy compared to other models. Especially, the LME model that uses growth stage as random effect obtained satisfactory estimation accuracy (R2 = 0.84, RMSE = 2.12 t ha−1), which indicated the growth stage as an important factor for the rice estimation model. In the practical application, the cultivar, planting pattern and growth stage of rice need to be obtained prior to using this model. China established a complete service system for agricultural technology extension and it is easy to obtain crop planting information. For other countries and regions in the world, these data could be collected in different ways. In the USA, crop statistics can be obtained from the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) products, which are produced by the National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) [65]. Furthermore, Farm Service Agency-Common Land Units (FSA-CLU) can also provide such data [66]. In Europe, the data can be generated by the European Union Global Monitoring of Food Security (GMFS) program and JRC’s Monitoring Agricultural ResourceS (MARS) action of the European Commission in Ispra (Italy) [67]. In other areas, the crop statistics can be obtained from the Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) of the FAO, which continually receives economic, political and agricultural information from a wide variety of sources (UN organizations, 115 governments, four regional organizations and 61 non-governmental organizations) [66]. Even if the planting information is hard to acquire for a particular region, the rice growth stage can easily be obtained via field observation. In such a case, the LME model, which uses growth stage as random effect, would be a feasible alternative, since the model achieves a sufficient estimation accuracy. The model provides technical support for the building estimation model from field to regional scales in the future.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Advantages of the LME Model for Estimating Rice Growth Parameters,4
471,"This study explored the potential for the estimation of rice AGB and LAI with a fixed-wing UAV, using the LME model and three baseline retrieval methods (SR, ANN and RF). The results of SR modelling showed that several NIR-based and red edge-based VIs had preferable relationships with growth parameters (AGB and LAI) both for the whole season and pre-heading stages, while all selected VIs were weakly related to growth parameters for post-heading stages. The LME model outperformed the other models (SR, ANN and RF), with the highest R2 and lowest RMSE for both AGB and LAI estimation. In particular, the LME model significantly improved the estimation accuracy (AGB: R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.97 t ha−1; LAI: R2 = 0.76, RMSE = 1.16) for post-heading stages. In summary, this study demonstrates the potential utility of using a fixed-wing UAV combined with the LME model to estimate rice growth parameters. The findings can further serve as a useful reference and technical support for precision farming management and decision-making over large-scale farmland.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
472,"As a crucial component of the permafrost system, the soil active layer is subjected to freezing and thawing on an annual basis and thus plays an important role in regulating the energy, water, and carbon cycles [1,2,3]. An increase in the active layer thickness (ALT) is regarded as an initial response of permafrost to global warming [4,5]. Thickening of the active layer releases carbon dioxide and methane stored in the upper layer of permafrost, which then further contributes to warming the global climate [6]. In the context of global change, the thickness and distribution of the active layer may be significantly influenced by interactions among climate, topography, land cover, and land use at various spatial scales [7]. Meanwhile, active layer dynamics can have pronounced effects on the hydrology and hydrogeology of land surfaces and also can affect ecological and biogeochemical processes in ecosystems [6], such as vegetation growth [8] and greenhouse gas emissions [9,10]. Additionally, the active layer and permafrost beneath can be impacted by human activities and can influence the well-being of people and infrastructure [11,12]. For example, deforestation may reduce the permafrost table, while thickening of the active layer can degrade human habitats by destabilizing structures [2,13]. Knowledge of active layer dynamics is crucial to determining ecosystem stability and also its societal impacts at high-latitude locations of the northern hemisphere [4], making it a significant topic in cryosphere research.Previous studies that have examined changes in the ALT during the contemporary period have mainly used soil temperature observations based on frost probing (e.g., [7,8,14,15,16]). Traditional station-based active layer mapping (e.g., [17,18]) is relatively simple and straightforward but fails to reflect the high spatial heterogeneity of the ALT. To mitigate this problem, a number of geophysical process models (e.g., the Geophysical Institute Permafrost Lab model [19], and the Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature model [20]) have been developed. These models typically accurately depict the relationship between the active layer and its influencing factors. However, some key variables in these models are difficult to obtain at regional scales, such as the aerodynamic resistance between the canopy and overlying air (e.g., in the Northern Ecosystem Soil Temperature model), thus making it difficult to apply these modelling approaches across different regions.Remote sensing has great potential for monitoring changes of the active layer and permafrost because it offers continuous land surface data sets (e.g., surface temperature and emissivity) and allows broad scale coverage (e.g., [21,22,23,24]). However, directly estimating thaw depth with remote sensing remains difficult because it is difficult to detect soil properties below the ground surface. Thick snow depth also makes remote sensing hard to detect soil thermal regimes in the winter. Thus, the integration of remote sensing and permafrost modeling provides an effective way to investigate changes in both the thickness and distribution of the active layer.This study investigated the ALT by combining permafrost modeling and remote sensing imagery in Chinese boreal larch forests from 2000 to 2015. Chinese boreal larch forests play an important role in the regional carbon budget. This landscape has also undergone rapid development and experienced climatic warming in recent decades [25]. The main objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to estimate the distribution of active layer thickness; (2) to examine changes in ALT in response to climate change; and (3) to identify drivers of spatio-temporal patterns of ALT in the study area.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
473,"The present study focused on the Chinese boreal larch forests (50°00′–53°33′N, 119°12′–127°00′E) of northeastern China (Figure 1), which is located in the southward extension of the Eurasian permafrost [25,26]. This area is characterized by a cool–temperate continental monsoon climate with long and severe winters, but short and warm summers [27]. Mean annual air temperature is approximately −2.6 °C with 80–110 frost-free days per year. The mean annual precipitation is 428–526 mm with more than 60% falling in summer [28]. Snowfall (snow water equivalent) is less than 20% of the total precipitation. Snow depth is typically less than 50 cm and snow melts completely in summer. Atmospheric temperature inversions caused by Siberian high pressure strongly influence the winter climate in the study area [25]. The dominant tree species in this region is Larix gmelinii (Figure S1), with a significant population of Pinus pumila growing on hilltops and shady slopes. Shrubs, grasses, and mosses grow interspersed among the trees [25] on primarily Umbri-Gelic Cambisol [29]. The presence of dense forests and understories facilitates the preservation and development of permafrost [30].The entire study area is located within the discontinuous and sporadic permafrost zones (see Figure 1) [31]. Forests in the study area are prone to experiencing periodic wildfires, with fires return interval ranging from 30 to 120 years [32]. On 5 May 2003, a mega-fire occurred burning about 79,000 ha in the center of Genhe County (see Figure 1).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area,2
474,"This study employed the level 3 MODIS eight-day tiled land surface temperature (LST) product. Previous studies have shown that MODIS LST exhibited a high correlation with the near-surface air temperature as recorded by weather stations (e.g., [33,34,35]). The period of the thaw was identified when mean daily LST was exceeded 0 °C. Although the LST data used in this study was the eight-day product, some null values were included due to poor weather conditions. These missing data were offset with a sliding window interpolation [36].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Remote Sensing Data,2

To calculate DDT, we collected the GST data from eight meteorological stations (see Figure 1 and Table S1) and then calculated the mean eight-day GST from 2000 to 2015. Overall, the mean GST was above 0 °C from day 105th to 281st in most years. Thus, we created a linear equation of GST in response to MODIS LST in the thaw period from 2000 to 2015 and evaluated the linear model by adjusted R square. Using this linear model, we estimated the GST data of the entire study area and then calculated DDT for each year.We predicted ALT for the high-emission scenario (RCP8.5), under which the air temperature is expected to increase by 2.6–4.8 °C by 2100 [44]. First, we created a linear equation between air temperature and GST based on data in the summer over 16 years. Second, using this equation, we predicted GST by 2100 and then calculated DDT. Third, we modelled ALT and validated the output by the method of replacing time with space. It was difficult to predict air temperature and GST during the thaw period. We made several assumptions to predict ALT by 2100: mean air temperature in the summer also increased 2.6–4.8 °C; the edaphic parameter and length of thaw period were not changed; and the linear equation between LST and GST could be used to estimate GST in the future.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Parameter Estimation and ALT Prediction,2
477,"Model performance was evaluated against field-measured ALT. We selected 13 sites for validation (as shown in Figure 1) with each validation site having two to seven investigated points (Table S2). By drilling boreholes and using electronic thermometer, we measured ALT as the depth between the ground surface and the soil layer at 0 °C in late September 2015. Sensitivity analysis was used to determine which parameter contributed most to uncertainties in ALT estimation, and then to predict future changes in ALT. We used the one-at-a-time measures technique, which calculated the output by repeatedly varying one parameter at a time and holding the others fixed [45], to analyze the sensitivities of DDT and the n-factor to ALT. Mann–Kendall test and the Sen’s methods were used to determine the change trend in ALT (Figure S2). The data analysis was performed in R (R Development Core Team, 2009). Four R packages (sp, rdgal, raster, and trend) were used in this study.To analyze the influence of wildfire on ALT, we selected the unburned area of Genhe County as a control. We used the GIS control site selection method described in Dilts et al. [46] to ensure that both burned and unburned areas had similar characteristics, such as land cover type (Figure 1) and elevation. We calculated ΔALT (ALTi – ALT2002, where 2003 ≤ i ≤ 2015). By comparing ΔALT between the control and burned areas, we analyzed the influence of wildfire disturbance on ALT.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Model Evaluation and Output Analyses,2
478,"We found that GST can be robustly estimated with the MODIS LST during the thaw period (Figure 2). The relationship between LST and GST can be shown as GST = 1.0328 × LST + 0.9579 (R2 = 0.71, p < 0.001). We calculated the number of degree days of thaw based on this equation and then modeled ALT using the Stefan equation. The observed and modelled mean ALT of the 13 validation sites were both 1.16 m. The mean relative error was 7%, while the root mean square error was 0.1 m, indicating an accurate representation of ALT in this study area with the Stefan equation. An increase of 50% in DDT would increase ALT by 22%, while a 50% decrease may decrease ALT by 29% (Figure 3a). Based on the data from six weather stations located in this region, the mean n-factor in the thaw period was 1.22 and its standard deviation was 0.24 over 16 years of observation, which would lead to a 10% variation in ALT (Figure 3b).", 3. Results, 3.1. Model Evaluation and Parameter Sensitivity,3
479,"The mean ALT in Chinese boreal larch forests fluctuated between 1.18 and 1.3 m from 2000 to 2015 without exhibiting an obvious temporal trend. Results from the Stefan equation showed that mean ALT slightly increased in the first three years, and then decreased 0.11 m in the following seven years. After that, the mean ALT unchanged from 2010 to 2012, and then decreased by 0.08 m in 2013 while increasing 0.09 m through 2015. Interannual variations of ALT in discontinuous and sporadic permafrost areas (1.13–1.27 m and 1.22–1.33 m, respectively) were similar to the ALT of the entire study area.Overall, ALT was low in the west-central part of the study area and high in the eastern and the southernmost parts. In most years, ALT was lower than 1.1 m in Genhe County and western Huma County, which featured the highest elevations of the study area. Active layer thickness was larger than 1.2 m in Xinlin County and eastern Huma County at relatively low elevations. The largest ALT occurred in southern Erguna County at the lowest latitude in the region. The regional-level spatial distribution pattern of ALT was similar across years of the study period.The active layer significantly deepened in northeastern Tahe, northern Mohe, eastern Huma, the center of Erguna, and the area along the border between Mohe and Genhe counties (Figure 4). Active layer depth significantly decreased in southern Erguna and some areas burned more than a decade ago. In most areas, ALT had not changed significantly. Overall, the change rate of regional-level ALT was less than 1 cm year−1 (Figure 4).", 3. Results, 3.2. Active Layer Thickness,3
480,"Results showed that the ALT in the burned area was greater than that in the control area from 2003 to 2012. In contrast, the ALT in the burned area was lower than in the control area before 2003 (Figure 5a). These results suggest that wildfire immediately increased the ALT with the difference in ΔALT varying significantly between the burned and control areas (p < 0.01), even though mean ΔALT in the burned area was only slightly larger than in the control area. From 2002 to 2015, ΔALT did not increase significantly in the burned area, while it increased 0.1 m in the control area (Figure 5b). In the burned area, however, ΔALT became negative in 2013. This result may imply that the effects of wildfire on ALT diminished over time, and then disappeared 10 years after the wildfire.Under the RCP8.5 scenario, an increase in air temperature would increase GST by 5.22–7.69 °C, according to the regression relationship between air temperature and GST during the thaw period of the study area. Therefore, ALT would increase into 1.2–1.3 m (2.6 °C) or 1.4–1.5 m (4.8 °C) in Genhe and western Huma at high elevations. In addition, it would increase into 1.6–1.7 m (2.6 °C) or 1.7–1.8 m (4.8 °C) in the eastern and southernmost parts of the study area by 2100 where latitude and elevation are low (Figure 6). On average, ALT would increase into 1.46–1.55 m over the entire study area if the air temperature increased by 2.6–4.8 °C.", 3. Results, 3.3. Effects of Wildfire and Climatic Warming on the Active Layer,3
481,"Our estimation results were consistent with the latitudinal temperature distribution when compared with data from Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring program. In this program, Brown et al. [14] reported that ALT was low in northern Alaska (0.3–0.6 m) but higher in Svalbard, Norway (0.96–1.57 m). In our study area, ALT was previously measured at about 1.5–3 m by ground penetration radar near the downtown area of Mohe [47], larger than estimate in this study (1.2–1.3 m). ALT was estimated at between 1.1 and 1.2 m in Huzhong National Nature Reserve, one of the areas in western Huma. This depth was similar to the measurements from Lv et al. [48] that showed the ALT in this region was 0.4–1.4 m.Our results differed from other studies (e.g., [25]) that suggested that permafrost was becoming degraded and the active layer had deepened as a result of global climate warming. The active layer was not only influenced by air temperature but also by topography and land cover. In comparison to estimating ALT with air temperature, LST, as the main data source of this study, provided more information on the spatial and temporal variations of the state of equilibrium at the surface [49].", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Estimation of Active Layer Thickness,4
482,"Although the regional-level spatial and temporal variations in ALT were largely affected by air temperature, other factors—such as vegetation, snow density and depth, slope, aspect, waterbodies, etc. [7]—also influenced the thickness and distribution of the active layer by regulating the temperature.Mean summer air temperature increased in Mohe and Tahe counties but had no obvious trend in Xinlin and Huma counties over 16 years. Air temperature decreased in Erguna in the summer from 2011 to 2015 (Figure S3). An increase in air temperature will result in increased heat input into soil and accelerate the degradation of permafrost. Thus, the increasing trend of ALT in the northeastern part of the study area is considered to be caused by an increase in air temperature. The significant decrease of ALT in southern Erguna may have been caused by a decrease in air temperature.Elevation was negatively correlated with ALT (p < 0.001, Figure S4) because the air temperature and GST decrease with an increase in elevation. In areas with elevations above 800 m, the mean DDT was 1898–2390 °C-day, about 261–377 °C-day lower than that in areas with elevations below 800 m. Additionally, the changes of land cover and land use will affect ALT by altering evapotranspiration and heat input into the soil. For instance, forest cover protects permafrost from degradation better than grassland because the former has a strong evapotranspiration and shading effect. Wildfire can remove the organic layers and vegetation, which will accelerate the exchange of energy between air and soil. Mean summer GST and ALT would increase after a wildfire, especially soon after a wildfire occurs. In control area of the Genhe mega-fire, the mean DDT decreased by 116–482 °C-day during 2003 to 2015 in comparison to 2002. However, the difference of DDT between pre- and post-fire was 56–423 °C-day larger in the burned area than in the control area since 2003. This result suggests that the effects of wildfire on ALT were partly offset by a decrease in DDT that presented in the control area. Vegetation restoration is expected to cause the effects of wildfire on ALT to diminish over time. Increased vegetation cover creates shading that reduces the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground and cools the surface by enhancing evapotranspiration [50]. Therefore, the change trend of ALT was negative in early burned areas. However, self-thinning becomes an active process when a young even-aged forest grows to maturity [51], resulting in a relatively open forest cover, which may increase the amount of solar radiation reaching the ground. The interannual variation of ALT is considered to be the result of the interaction between air temperature, wildfire, vegetation recovery, and self-thinning in early burned areas.Land cover change such as building infrastructure may accelerate a deepening of the active layer. The ALT under natural surfaces is lower than under asphalt pavement because asphalt can absorb heat and reduce evaporation [52]. Logging in the study area has greatly disturbed forest environments; the present study area is one of the main sources of lumber in China. Original and secondary forests have partially disappeared because of an increase in the size of the human population in the region [25]. These anthropogenic disturbances could cause an increase in soil temperature and deepen the active layer. Brown et al. [53] found that the depth of thaw doubled after vegetation removal. Deforestation often destroys the moss and litter layers and weakens their insulating effect. This allows more insolation and wind to reach the ground surface and may increase the amount of sensible and latent heat released to the environment, especially in freezing seasons [25,54]. Human disturbance, however, has less of an effect on ALT in high elevation areas where wetlands and national nature reserves occupy a significant proportion of landscape and provide a level of environmental protection and stability.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Spatio-Temporal Variations in Active Layer Thickness,4
483,"Although the Stefan equation performed well, we would like to acknowledge some uncertainties in the present study. First, we modeled ALT using 1-km MODIS data, which cannot detect the influence of microscale (<1 km) factors on ALT. Second, soil thermal conductivity was calculated by soil water content that was limited by the investigation and spatial heterogeneity. Third, the n-factor was a key parameter in the Stefan equation and impacted by soil conditions and other factors. It had spatio-temporal variability even though we analyzed parameter sensitivity. To analyze the related uncertainty, however, we found that ALT would increase about 9.5% if thermal conductivity increased by 20%; an increase of 20% in soil volumetric latent heat of fusion would result in a decrease in ALT by 8.8%. The maximum n-factor (1.48) was calculated in Tahe in 2008 while the minimum (1.09) was in Mohe in 2012. In comparison to the mean n-factor, the maximum n-factor increased ALT by 10% and the minimum decreased by 5%.Although we modelled ALT in the future, the influence of winter air temperature and snow were not taken into account. Warming occurred in winter and spring is stronger than in summer [55], which suggests that the estimated ALT may be lower than values based on soil temperature measurements. A deep snow cover may protect soil from cold atmosphere and foster high soil moisture levels, leading to greater ALT. In contrast, some studies (e.g., [56]) indicated that snow cover had small effects on ALT. Zhang et al. [57] found that snow cover was either positively or negatively related with ALT. According to an investigation in Chinese boreal forest, snow cover with less than 15 cm has a little influence on the ground temperature, even a thickness of 15–30 cm snow thickness cannot protect ground surface temperature from the influence of the shortwave radiation reaching the snow–ground interface [58].It is hard to predict air temperature and GST during the thaw period by 2100, resulting in uncertainty in our output. However, we used the method of replacing time with space to validate the modelled output. Mean air temperature during 2000 to 2015 was 0.15 °C in Huma and −3.59 °C in Mohe. We assumed that air temperature increased from −3.59 °C to 0.15 °C in the future, then compared GST and ALT between Huma and Mohe. Mean ALT over 16 years increased from 1.33 m to 1.43 m. Therefore, we considered that the predicted ALT by 2100 was seasonable. Using the same model, Woo et al. [59] predicted that the ALT may increase by 0.3 m by 2100 in the boreal forest of the Mackenzie Valley, which was favorably comparable with ours (increased from 1.18–1.3 m to 1.46–1.55 m).", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Uncertainty Analysis,4
484,"The current research demonstrates a method for integrating modelling with remote sensing data for estimating the thickness and distribution of the active layer in Chinese boreal larch forests. Active layer thickness varied from 1.18 to 1.3 m from 2000 to 2015. Temporal variations in regional-level ALT were less than 0.1 m in most areas over 16 years, with a change trend of ±0.01 m year−1. The areas of low ALT were in areas of high elevation and decreased air temperature, whereas the areas with high ALT were in areas of low elevation, nonforested land, human or natural disturbances, and increased air temperature. In the burned area of Genhe, the influence of wildfire on ALT appeared to last for 10 years. Under the high emission scenario (RCP8.5), mean ALT would increase to 1.46–1.55 m by 2100.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
485,"Forest biomass is a globally important carbon reservoir, and forest growth can significantly mitigate the climate-altering effects of fossil fuel emissions [1,2]. There are a number of incipient spaceborne missions designed to measure forest biomass around the planet:(1)GEDI (NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation) uses waveform lidar to measure aboveground biomass (AGB) at 22-m footprints, which is in turn used to infer mean biomass at the level of 1-km grid cells [3,4,5];(2)BIOMASS (a European Space Agency Earth Explorer mission) uses P-band radar to map AGB at 200m spatial resolution [6];(3)NISAR (joint mission between NASA and the Indian Space Research Organisation) operates an L-band and an S-band synthetic aperture radar that enables observation of biomass change at hectare scales [7]; and,(4)ICESAT-2 (NASA) uses linear tracks of pulse-counting lidar that, in combination with other instruments, allows measurement of vegetation biomass [8].While sensors such as these provide observations closely correlated with forest structure, biomass must be inferred through the use of models calibrated with ground measurements [9,10,11]. Such models imply, sometimes explicitly [12], a stand-level wood density: a ratio of measured canopy volume to biomass. What these models do not consider, to our knowledge, is any sensitivity of wood specific gravity (WSG) to stand age.This is surprising for two reasons. First, within individual ecosystems, it is well understood that faster-growing pioneer species often have lower WSG than later-successional trees [13,14]. If young stands are indeed dominated by lower-density species, models applied to remote sensing data from those stands will generally over-predict biomass. This is important because a promising application of globally collected biomass data is inference of ecosystem carbon dynamics by estimating the difference in average carbon content of stands with different ages. This process, sometimes called “chronosequencing” when used with inventory plots [15], provides insight into rates of carbon accumulation.Over-prediction of the WSG of young stands in this framework would obscure both the impact of stand-replacing disturbances upon carbon stocks and the rate of carbon re-growth. The fact that biomass models are generally not sensitive to stand age is also surprising because long-term, spatially exhaustive records of forest disturbance are widely available [16,17]. Such records could be used to both develop and apply age-sensitive models.In this paper, we used the nationally comprehensive inventory of the US Forest Service’s FIA (Forest Inventory and Analysis) Program to evaluate the degree to which stand-level mean WSG depends upon stand age. FIA maintains a grid of inventory plots (approximately 1 plot per 2430 hectares), across which a variety of tree- and stand-level attributes are measured every 5–10 years. This sample is the basis for the forest component of the US Greenhouse Gas Inventory [18] and can also support detailed assessment of model scaling properties across a wide range of conditions (e.g., [19]). We made estimates of mean basal area-weighted WSG (with uncertainty) for each 10-year age bin within 12 ecological divisions covering the conterminous United States.To understand any changes in WSG as a function of stand age, we used the same database to evaluate how the proportional distribution (by share of total basal area) of the eight most common species (again, by basal area) changed across age bins in each ecoregion. While there is no reason to see ecosystems of the United States as globally representative, analysis across 12 diverse, data-rich regions was intended to suggest the degree to which stand age’s impact on WSG should or should not be considered in efforts to model AGB from remotely sensed measurements.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
486,"The goal of this study was to estimate, for each of the ecological divisions shown in Figure 1, the mean WSG for forests in ten-year age classes. This required knowing stand age and average basal area-weighted WSG at the level of the FIA condition. Conditions, which are mapped sub-divisions of FIA plots defined by boundaries related to variables such as land cover class and forest type, are the finest unit at which stand age is assigned. Inclusion probability of all conditions within FIA’s spatially balanced simple random sample frame are known, so once mean WSG was known for each condition, FIA’s standard estimation protocols [20] could be used to derive ecozone-level estimates of WSG by age class.In this investigation, it was important to include seedlings along with more mature trees in the basal area weighting process. Though seedlings (diameter less than 2.54 cm) have no recorded basal area in the database, such trees can be the only cohort in the critical first age bin (1–10 years old). FIA only measures these trees on micro-plots (2.07 m radius) nested within each of the four sub-plots (7.32 m radius) making up the standard plot design. We calculated basal area for each measured seedling based upon an arbitrarily chosen diameter of 1 cm. We likewise included saplings (2.54–12.7 cm diameter), which are also measured on micro-plots, but do have recorded diameters.Because the probabilities of inclusion for seedlings and saplings observed on micro-plots and trees observed on sub-plots were different, it was necessary to convert (from [22]) the sums of both basal area and the product of basal area and WSG to per-unit-area terms to determine mean basal area-weighted wood density at the condition level:

Stand age at the condition level is assigned by field crews through coring representative overstory trees at breast height and adding a fixed amount of time to represent the period between stand establishment and pith development at breast height [24]. Mean WSG per 10-year age class was then estimated at the ecological division scale, accounting for the proportion of the area sampled by each condition, following [21]. To provide context around any differences across ages in mean WSG, total basal area by tree species for each age bin was also calculated (ibid.).", 2. Methods,None,2
487,"Measurements in this study were based upon 3,548,265 tree measurements and 2,695,735 seedling measurements collected across 132,582 FIA plots (Table 1). The area of each ecological division ranged from 0.4 to 67.9 million hectares (ha). The overall basal-weighted mean WSG varied by region from 0.4 (Mountain Regime of the Temperate Steppe division) to 0.65 (Tropical/Subtropical Desert).Significant shifts in species distributions occurred across age classes in each ecological division. Figure 2 shows these shifts in terms of the changing fraction of total basal area by species across age bins (limited to eight most common species by basal area); scientific names of all species are listed in Appendix A. In some cases, species are well represented either in the younger or older age groups. For example, in the Tropical/Subtropical Desert division, honey mesquite is dominant in the younger age classes but virtually absent in the older classes, while Utah juniper shows the opposite trend. A species’ fractional basal area across age bins may also remain relatively stable (e.g., western hemlock in the Marine division), or it may be multi-modal (e.g., loblolly pine in the Subtropical division). The WSG assigned by FIA to the species shown in Figure 2 varies from 0.29 (northern white cedar) to 0.8 (live oak).Despite the dynamic distribution of tree species by age class, basal area-weighted WSG remained relatively constant in most regions. The only place where WSG trended consistently upward over age groups was the Hot Continental division, and even there the mean difference between the 1–10-year-old age group and the over 171-year-old group was just 0.05. Sampling errors were small relative to estimated mean specific gravity, with the exception of some of the rarer, older age groups in the Tropical/Sub-tropical Desert and the Temperate Steppe (non-mountain) divisions (Figure 2).The largest change in WSG across age groups at the division level was actually a decline with age; mean density went from 0.69 at 11–20 years to 0.48 at 101–110 years in the Tropical/Subtropical Steppe division. Changes in most ecological divisions were much smaller, and in no case was there a sharp discontinuity in density from younger to older stands. The range of average specific gravity was greater across ecological divisions, ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 (Table 1), than within ecological divisions across age groups (Figure 2).", 3. Results,None,3
488,"Understanding the rate of AGB recovery following disturbance is critical for predicting forest carbon dynamics and for identifying the potential impact of forest management in mitigating climate change. Support for such assessments is relatively simple when extensive inventory data are available; designed samples used by inventories promote representativeness, and measurement error of field samples is generally presumed to be negligible. Williams et al. [25] refined net ecosystem productivity (NEP) functions used in a process model (the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) by plotting measured AGB against stand age at a large number of FIA locations. This allowed improved characterization of the role of disturbance and management in carbon dynamics of US forests.Additional uncertainties become relevant when basic data about biomass and biomass change must be modeled from remote sensing. For example, vegetation demographic models, which track multiple size classes within a given plant functional type to predict outcomes under different scenarios, can use remotely sensed forest biomass maps as benchmark constraints [26]. One type of uncertainty involved with using remote sensing as a benchmark involves transferability: does the relationship used to build the underlying model—between biomass and lidar- or radar-measured height, for example—actually hold in the populations where the model is applied? There is broad awareness of this issue in the context of transferring models across regions [27]. The issue is less appreciated when models are built locally but might not be appropriate for transfer across different successional stages. This is particularly relevant if the difference in predicted biomass between old and young stands is being used to infer a rate of biomass accumulation.The question addressed by this paper was relatively narrow: with an emerging generation of active remote sensing platforms capable of supporting ecosystem demography and other approaches to tracking carbon dynamics, should models targeting prediction of forest biomass explicitly account for stand age? Remote sensing generally only measures canopy structure, requiring models to either implicitly or explicitly assign the wood density (measured by specific gravity) needed to infer biomass. If WSG were found to change radically with stand age, perhaps due to successional processes, it would argue for broad use of age-sensitive models.Given the relatively high precision of our estimates (approximately 500 field plots per age bin per region), it is clear that shifts in WSG do occur with stand age (Figure 2). However, our results suggested that differences in WSG at the ecological division scale are much lower across stand age than they are across ecosystems. With field resources scarce in many regions, this argues for prioritizing collection of new data in under-sampled ecosystems above sampling a range of ages for each tree size category.Our analysis treated WSG as a species-specific constant, ignoring variation that might occur due to soil properties [28] or stand density [29]. However, site-level variation probably had a minimal effect across such a large sample. More serious with respect to our goal of comparing wood density across age groups would be a case where the specific gravity of wood added by individual trees changes as the trees age. Investigations into this question, though, have shown wood density to vary only slightly as a function of tree age and factors such as competition that may co-vary with tree age [30,31]. Treating WSG as a constant also ignores variation that may occur across ecological gradients. There is evidence that, both within and across species, WSG can vary with climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation [32,33]. Assigning more regionally specific density values (assuming they are correct) for species such as Douglas fir, which range from moist lowland forests to drier high-elevation systems, would lead to more accurate estimates of mean WSG across age groups. Until nationally comprehensive empirical data exist that can be used to refine the WSG values used by FIA, the impact of local ecological variation will remain unknown.It is reasonable to ask why it appears mean WSG does not increase with age, as one might expect from an idealized scenario where fast-growing colonizer species are replaced by slower-growing, longer-lived trees. This dynamic undoubtedly occurs on some sites, and species composition does vary strongly by age in many of the regions studied. In some cases, succession simply does not produce a change in average WSG. For instance, red alder, which fixes nitrogen and is an early colonizer following disturbance [34], occurred in younger stands in the Marine division, but not in older stands. At the same time, slower-growing, shade tolerant species such as mountain hemlock and silver fir represented a significant share of basal area only in the region’s older stands. However, the wood of red alder, silver fir, and mountain hemlock all have specific gravities between 0.37 and 0.42; succession in this region did not bring a big change in mean wood density.More broadly, the role of human impact must be acknowledged. Age bins in Figure 2 do not represent uninterrupted successional pathways; management of regeneration and historical harvest patterns have manipulated species distributions for centuries. For example, loblolly pines were relatively rare in the pre-European forests of the southern United States. The collapse of the cotton industry in the 1880s provided abandoned fields where loblolly pine had an establishment advantage because of their light, easily dispersed seeds [35]. Fire suppression allowed these new loblolly stands to thrive in the following decades [ibid], explaining the species’ importance in the region’s older age classes. Loblolly pine is also widely used in plantations, where it is managed on relatively short rotations. This complex history explains the species’ multi-modal age distribution in Figure 2, and more importantly illustrates how human intervention affects the demography of our forests.This study notably did not cover a tropical system, and work in other areas should assess whether our results—the relative insensitivity of WSG at regional scales to stand age—apply elsewhere. While tropical species such as cecropia fit the stereotype of low-density colonizers [36], many disturbed tropical sites are colonized by longer-lived pioneers with life forms closer to those of primary forest trees [37]. Human intervention may likewise disrupt presumed successional trends, as was the case with loblolly pine in the Subtropical Division.", 4. Discussion,None,4
489,"In general, it is convenient that average WSG—the amount of biomass per unit volume—does not vary strongly with stand age. New remote sensing platforms are giving us unprecedented information about tree size, but we would need significantly more calibration data, and more complex models, if large trees in young stands had consistently higher or lower biomass than large trees in older stands. Differences in WSG were much greater across ecosystems than across age groups within the same ecosystem. This finding allows the community to focus upon acquiring reference data in poorly sampled ecosystems instead of expanding existing samples to include a range of ages for each level of canopy height.", 5.

Stand age at the condition level is assigned by field crews through coring representative overstory trees at breast height and adding a fixed amount of time to represent the period between stand establishment and pith development at breast height [24]. Mean WSG per 10-year age class was then estimated at the ecological division scale, accounting for the proportion of the area sampled by each condition, following [21]. To provide context around any differences across ages in mean WSG, total basal area by tree species for each age bin was also calculated (ibid.).", 2. Methods,None,2
492,"Measurements in this study were based upon 3,548,265 tree measurements and 2,695,735 seedling measurements collected across 132,582 FIA plots (Table 1). The area of each ecological division ranged from 0.4 to 67.9 million hectares (ha). The overall basal-weighted mean WSG varied by region from 0.4 (Mountain Regime of the Temperate Steppe division) to 0.65 (Tropical/Subtropical Desert).Significant shifts in species distributions occurred across age classes in each ecological division. Figure 2 shows these shifts in terms of the changing fraction of total basal area by species across age bins (limited to eight most common species by basal area); scientific names of all species are listed in Appendix A. In some cases, species are well represented either in the younger or older age groups. For example, in the Tropical/Subtropical Desert division, honey mesquite is dominant in the younger age classes but virtually absent in the older classes, while Utah juniper shows the opposite trend. A species’ fractional basal area across age bins may also remain relatively stable (e.g., western hemlock in the Marine division), or it may be multi-modal (e.g., loblolly pine in the Subtropical division). The WSG assigned by FIA to the species shown in Figure 2 varies from 0.29 (northern white cedar) to 0.8 (live oak).Despite the dynamic distribution of tree species by age class, basal area-weighted WSG remained relatively constant in most regions. The only place where WSG trended consistently upward over age groups was the Hot Continental division, and even there the mean difference between the 1–10-year-old age group and the over 171-year-old group was just 0.05. Sampling errors were small relative to estimated mean specific gravity, with the exception of some of the rarer, older age groups in the Tropical/Sub-tropical Desert and the Temperate Steppe (non-mountain) divisions (Figure 2).The largest change in WSG across age groups at the division level was actually a decline with age; mean density went from 0.69 at 11–20 years to 0.48 at 101–110 years in the Tropical/Subtropical Steppe division. Changes in most ecological divisions were much smaller, and in no case was there a sharp discontinuity in density from younger to older stands. The range of average specific gravity was greater across ecological divisions, ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 (Table 1), than within ecological divisions across age groups (Figure 2).", 3. Results,None,3
493,"Understanding the rate of AGB recovery following disturbance is critical for predicting forest carbon dynamics and for identifying the potential impact of forest management in mitigating climate change. Support for such assessments is relatively simple when extensive inventory data are available; designed samples used by inventories promote representativeness, and measurement error of field samples is generally presumed to be negligible. Williams et al. [25] refined net ecosystem productivity (NEP) functions used in a process model (the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach) by plotting measured AGB against stand age at a large number of FIA locations. This allowed improved characterization of the role of disturbance and management in carbon dynamics of US forests.Additional uncertainties become relevant when basic data about biomass and biomass change must be modeled from remote sensing. For example, vegetation demographic models, which track multiple size classes within a given plant functional type to predict outcomes under different scenarios, can use remotely sensed forest biomass maps as benchmark constraints [26]. One type of uncertainty involved with using remote sensing as a benchmark involves transferability: does the relationship used to build the underlying model—between biomass and lidar- or radar-measured height, for example—actually hold in the populations where the model is applied? There is broad awareness of this issue in the context of transferring models across regions [27]. The issue is less appreciated when models are built locally but might not be appropriate for transfer across different successional stages. This is particularly relevant if the difference in predicted biomass between old and young stands is being used to infer a rate of biomass accumulation.The question addressed by this paper was relatively narrow: with an emerging generation of active remote sensing platforms capable of supporting ecosystem demography and other approaches to tracking carbon dynamics, should models targeting prediction of forest biomass explicitly account for stand age? Remote sensing generally only measures canopy structure, requiring models to either implicitly or explicitly assign the wood density (measured by specific gravity) needed to infer biomass. If WSG were found to change radically with stand age, perhaps due to successional processes, it would argue for broad use of age-sensitive models.Given the relatively high precision of our estimates (approximately 500 field plots per age bin per region), it is clear that shifts in WSG do occur with stand age (Figure 2). However, our results suggested that differences in WSG at the ecological division scale are much lower across stand age than they are across ecosystems. With field resources scarce in many regions, this argues for prioritizing collection of new data in under-sampled ecosystems above sampling a range of ages for each tree size category.Our analysis treated WSG as a species-specific constant, ignoring variation that might occur due to soil properties [28] or stand density [29]. However, site-level variation probably had a minimal effect across such a large sample. More serious with respect to our goal of comparing wood density across age groups would be a case where the specific gravity of wood added by individual trees changes as the trees age. Investigations into this question, though, have shown wood density to vary only slightly as a function of tree age and factors such as competition that may co-vary with tree age [30,31]. Treating WSG as a constant also ignores variation that may occur across ecological gradients. There is evidence that, both within and across species, WSG can vary with climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation [32,33]. Assigning more regionally specific density values (assuming they are correct) for species such as Douglas fir, which range from moist lowland forests to drier high-elevation systems, would lead to more accurate estimates of mean WSG across age groups. Until nationally comprehensive empirical data exist that can be used to refine the WSG values used by FIA, the impact of local ecological variation will remain unknown.It is reasonable to ask why it appears mean WSG does not increase with age, as one might expect from an idealized scenario where fast-growing colonizer species are replaced by slower-growing, longer-lived trees. This dynamic undoubtedly occurs on some sites, and species composition does vary strongly by age in many of the regions studied. In some cases, succession simply does not produce a change in average WSG. For instance, red alder, which fixes nitrogen and is an early colonizer following disturbance [34], occurred in younger stands in the Marine division, but not in older stands. At the same time, slower-growing, shade tolerant species such as mountain hemlock and silver fir represented a significant share of basal area only in the region’s older stands. However, the wood of red alder, silver fir, and mountain hemlock all have specific gravities between 0.37 and 0.42; succession in this region did not bring a big change in mean wood density.More broadly, the role of human impact must be acknowledged. Age bins in Figure 2 do not represent uninterrupted successional pathways; management of regeneration and historical harvest patterns have manipulated species distributions for centuries. For example, loblolly pines were relatively rare in the pre-European forests of the southern United States. The collapse of the cotton industry in the 1880s provided abandoned fields where loblolly pine had an establishment advantage because of their light, easily dispersed seeds [35]. Fire suppression allowed these new loblolly stands to thrive in the following decades [ibid], explaining the species’ importance in the region’s older age classes. Loblolly pine is also widely used in plantations, where it is managed on relatively short rotations. This complex history explains the species’ multi-modal age distribution in Figure 2, and more importantly illustrates how human intervention affects the demography of our forests.This study notably did not cover a tropical system, and work in other areas should assess whether our results—the relative insensitivity of WSG at regional scales to stand age—apply elsewhere. While tropical species such as cecropia fit the stereotype of low-density colonizers [36], many disturbed tropical sites are colonized by longer-lived pioneers with life forms closer to those of primary forest trees [37]. Human intervention may likewise disrupt presumed successional trends, as was the case with loblolly pine in the Subtropical Division.", 4. Discussion,None,4
494,"In general, it is convenient that average WSG—the amount of biomass per unit volume—does not vary strongly with stand age. New remote sensing platforms are giving us unprecedented information about tree size, but we would need significantly more calibration data, and more complex models, if large trees in young stands had consistently higher or lower biomass than large trees in older stands. Differences in WSG were much greater across ecosystems than across age groups within the same ecosystem. This finding allows the community to focus upon acquiring reference data in poorly sampled ecosystems instead of expanding existing samples to include a range of ages for each level of canopy height.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
495,"Historical land use, land cover changes, and forest management practices affect the exchange of carbon between sources and sinks in forests [1]. Afforestation and reforestation programs in temperate regions have increased forest areas [2] and carbon accumulation since the 1970s, and this accumulation has significantly contributed to global terrestrial carbon sinks [3,4]. China has the largest afforested area in the world (~62 million ha in 2008), and most of them are carbon sinks [5], while southern China accounts for 65% of the forest carbon sink in China, especially for the fast-growing tree species [6]. However, historical time series of forest cover maps due to afforestation are still not available for generating the spatio-temporal dynamics of afforestation carbon storage or its biophysical mechanisms in response to climate change [7,8]. Traditional methods that have been used to monitor forest change (e.g., afforestation) have relied on permanent sample plot (PSP) surveys at the provincial scale, and these have been used for the national forest resources inventory in China [9]. However, the effectiveness of PSP for monitoring forest cover has been limited due to inadequate spatial coverage and a five-year survey rotation. Time series remotely sensed data have been considered an effective spatial detection tool to monitor long-term forest cover changes at large scales [10,11,12,13]. Past studies have identified forest cover primarily based on coarse resolution datasets (e.g., 300 m to 1 km) [14,15,16,17,18], thus leading to limited utility, especially at local scales [14]. Consequently, 30 m resolution Landsat-like products (e.g., China’s POK (pixel and object)-based 30 m GlobeLand30 (GLC30), Global Forest Change (GFC) data), or 25 m resolution PALSAR-based products (e.g., ALOS PALSAR-based global forest/non-forest mosaics) have been generated [11,13,19,20,21], and a variety of time series forest disturbance detection techniques and products have been developed by using automated and semi-automated algorithms [22,23,24,25]. However, bio-temporal or triple-temporal satellite images cannot capture the forest change spectrally [14,19,26]. It is much more difficult and complex for time series algorithms to develop the above-mentioned medium to high resolution land cover products at multiple temporal and spatial scales due to many factors; for example, time series optical remote-sensing-based products need good quality observations without the limits of cloud or cloud shadow, and to save time and labor in big data processing, and to minimize the spectral confusion, etc. [13,23,24]. Integration of optical sensors (e.g., Landsat and MODIS), radar sensor (Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), e.g., Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) on the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS)), and light detection and ranging (lidar) or high-resolution sensors can more accurately capture three-dimensional structures needed to delineate forest cover [27,28,29,30,31,32,33]; however, the latter two have limited spatial and temporal coverage due to the high costs [28,34].Cloud-free L-band SAR has been shown to be advantageous for monitoring cloudy and rainy tropical or sub-tropical areas [35], and the optical remote sensing, e.g., Landsat, also has the potential to balance the deficiencies of radar data, e.g., PALSAR, in distinguishing between forest and other confusing types (e.g., rock, building, and urban) [36]. Several successful published studies have investigated forest cover based on optical and radar data at different spatial scales [35,37,38,39,40]. However, previous studies have commonly been carried out in a single year [35,36], or multiple data comparisons (e.g., RapidEye, TM, PALSAR, Envisat ASAR)-based land cover (100 km by 100 km test site) monitoring by visual interpretation [41], or have taken multiple years to map forest cover (1984–2010) and to quantify forest encroachment into grasslands [42,43]. So, the integration of multi-sensor and multi-temporal remote sensing systems, including Landsat-like optical sensors and SAR, shows great potential to develop dense time-series forest mapping projects and assist with dynamic monitoring endeavors.Supervised classifications (e.g., support vector machine (SVM), boosting tree (stochastic gradient boosting (SGB)), decision tree, and random forest (RF)) [44,45,46] are more effective than unsupervised classification and object-oriented classification in terms of time series and large scales. The SVM classifier has been widely reported as an outstanding classifier in remote sensing [45]. The RF classifier has been tested due to its reported performance in the machine learning community [44]. The SGB algorithm usually outperformed traditional parameter or non-parameter methods (e.g., classification and regression, CART; RF) [47,48,49] in land use, land cover classification [48], and forest fuel type mapping [47]. Furthermore, the SGB algorithm has been used to generate land cover types based on multispectral and hyperspectral images of individual years (e.g., IKONOS, Landsat ETM+, and Probe-1) [48,50]. However, previous studies have proven that PALSAR-based machine learning algorithms in forest cover mapping had some commission or omission error when used alone [36,51,52]. Temporally frequent Landsat data have long-term archives and free availability and similar image data [22], and the generated time-series spectral vegetation index can potentially provide vegetation phenology patterns, which are particularly useful in environments with limited accessibility and a lack of in situ measurements [53]. The use of such an index can help us understand vegetation dynamics with regard to climate change impacts on vegetation identification, such as vegetation-greenness-related normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [54]. Furthermore, in regard to the remote sensing change detection, forest cover produced by the plantation afforestation is defined as “forest stands that have been established artificially, either on land that has not supported forests in the last 50 years (i.e., afforestation), or on land that has supported forests in the past, but where the original vegetation has been replaced by forests (i.e., reforestation).” [55]. Therefore, dense time series and high resolution free and open access data, e.g., Landsat or PALSAR, hold the ability to form dense time observations to generate the robust forest cover change due to afforestation.The objective of this study is to extract annual forest change (1986–2016) due to afforestation in Guangdong, China. First, a novel procedure to identify and map annual forest cover caused by afforestation based on the integration of the PALSAR-based spectral and textural values and Landsat-based phenological variables is developed and tested. Then, the accuracy of the developed procedure is validated and compared using other forest/non-forest (FNF) products. Finally, forest aboveground biomass dynamics (AGB) under afforestation changes are investigated.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
496,"The study area is the Guangdong Province (20°13′N–25°31′N, 109°39′E–117°19′E, 17.97 × 104 km2, Figure 1) in China. The local topography is undulating (elevation 22–1353 m above sea level). The climate varies from subtropical to tropical. The annual mean precipitation is 1300–2500 mm, and the average temperature ranges from 19 to 24 °C. The wet season occurs from April to September, and the dry season is from November to January (February, March, and October are transitional months). In March and April, the northern region is often wet, but the southern region is dry [56]. In September, the pattern is reversed [56]. Most of the forest species are considered evergreen and fast-growing [57]. The most common extreme meteorological disaster includes chilling injury, storms and flooding, and drought [57].", 2.

497,"This study used radiometrically and geometrically corrected PALSAR mosaic data from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) according to topography and atmospherically corrected Landsat data from USGS/EROS processes. There were six years of PALSAR mosaics used through raw-strips-based tiles from July to September (Table 1, https://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_ fnf/data/index.htm): tiles covering p120r043, p121043, p122r043, and p123r043 in September were dry season data, while the remaining paths/rows (p120r044, p121r044, p122r044, p122r045, p123r044, p123r045, p124r045, and p124r046) in September and all of tiles from July to August were wet season data. The proportion of Landsat images (e.g., by paths/rows (Figure S1a), months (Figure S1b), sensors (Figure S1c), and phenology (dry or wet season, Figure S1d)) was counted in Figure S1.First, we converted the original PALSAR data to the backscatter coefficient in decibels, then implemented the enhanced Lee filter (window size, 5 × 5 pixels) to reduce speckles. Next, we produced some variables for land cover classification including HH, HV polarizations, HH/HV (ratio), HH- HV (difference), and HV texture measures (window size, 3 × 3 pixels, offset ([1,1]), and a 64 gray level quantization), which have been proven to distinguish well between forest and non-forest [21]. Finally, the 25 m PALSAR mosaic data and their derivatives were re-projected using Landsat data to match the 30 m spatial resolution (Table 1).The highest quality cloud-free images from the 12 Landsat path/row tiles (Figure 1, Figure S1) were used based on the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform (https://earthengine.google.com). ETM+ data after the year 2003 were filled based on the USGS LS7 SLC-off gap-filling algorithm, which was recreated for the Google Earth Engine by Noel Gorelick (https://code. earthengine.google.com/20cba 5268cbe117e2fc1c5fefc33f3) (Figure 2).

All of the ROIs were extracted in locations where only a single land cover type covered the area. They can be easily downloaded into different formats, such as Keyhole Markup Language files (.kml). Next, ArcGIS vector files (shapefile) were produced from ROIs in KML format. A series of land cover types were used (Figure 3), of which, a random 50% (13,581 polygons) of the total samples from six years was used as training data and overlaid on the PALSAR-based bands to classify the five land cover types by calculating the mean pixel value per polygon of the HH, HV, ratio, difference, and HV texture measures, and the chosen of the remaining samples were reserved as validation data for the classification accuracy assessment (Figure 2).", 2.

Evaluation of the PALSAR Backscatter Signatures for Land Cover TypesGaussian kernel density estimations [59] of the training ROIs (13,379) of land cover types (forest (2944 polygons, 21,800,050 pixels), other types (3153 polygons, 97,221 pixels, short for others), water (1114 polygons, 156,383 pixels), cropland (2739 polygons, 69,395 pixels), and urban areas (3429 polygons, 84,293 pixels)) in the bands of HH, HV, HV textural measures, Ratio, and Difference from all six years indicated the separability among these land cover types, especially water had lower HH and HV values, which can be easily identified (Figure 4). Urban has high HH values and lower ratio values, and can be identified based on these two indexes (Figure 4a,c); forest and urban have high HV values (Figure 4b), and lower values of forest can be seen in Difference (Figure 4d). Cropland can be identified in HV, while other types overlapped over the cropland (Figure 4b). Here, no obvious cost for HV-based texture measurements was found in distinguishing forest from the other non-forest types (Figure 4e–l). 2.4.2. Classification AlgorithmsThe support vector machine (SVM) classifier, RF classifier, stochastic gradient boosting (SGB) classifier, and C5.0 decision tree classifier were implemented to classify land cover types from the multi-temporal mosaic PALSAR and its derivatives (HH, HV, Ratio, and Difference, etc.) according to the above evaluation (Figure 2). The parameter settings used for each of the classifiers are listed in Table 2.A parallel computing technique was performed for the SVM, RF, and C5.0 classifiers to improve the efficiency of large area image processing in R (R Development Core Team, 2008) [60]. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) is an inherently sequential algorithm. The GBM package for SGB relies on a built-in parallel package [61]. Each iteration depends on the results of the previous iteration. GBM creates an ensemble of decision trees that build on top of each other. Each tree predicts the error of the next tree. When combined this ensemble performs extremely well [61]. The search for the best decision tree is done across the n.cores. GBM uses cross-validation to identify the best number of decision trees (either using the training or testing error). Contrasting this with random forest, where the algorithm is exceedingly parallel, every tree is independent of each other. This allows RF to be parallelized in ways GBM cannot. “doParallel” and “foreach” [62] in R interface were used to perform collaborative parallel processing. “foreach” allows for the creation of small trees, and they are then combined using the “combine” function. All of the images used for land cover classification were segmented based on the number of computer CPU cores along the latitude using “doParallel”. Any of the available CPU cores were called to process the segmentation part using “foreach”. Finally, all of the results from the segmented parts after processing were mosaicked. A majority filter by calculating focal values for the neighborhood of the default moving window (3 × 3 pixels) based on “raster” package was applied to reduce the issue of “salt and pepper”. Then a mathematical morphology opening operation (5 × 5 pixels) by “mmand” package was selected to eliminate the speckled and smooth boundaries, and to exclude the burrs and isolated pixels [63]. 2.4.3. PALSAR-Based Land Cover Types Mapping AssessmentA confusion matrix based on the validation plots was used to assess the PALSAR-based land cover maps. Half (2251 polygons, 2392 polygons) of the total land cover types plots were acquired for 2007 and 2016 (Figure 2 and Figure 3). Also, confusion matrix plots that compared the actual and predicted classes for five items were produced. The tiles were colored according to the frequency of the intersection of the two classes, thus, the diagonal represented where the actual class was predicted correctly. The color represented the relative frequency of that observation in the data; given some classes occur more frequently, the values were normalized before plotting. Any row of tiles (save for diagonal) represented instances where items were falsely identified as belonging to the specified class.

503," 2.5.1. Further Forest Mapping Based on the Integration of PALSAR-Based FNF and Landsat DataIn this study, a similar pixel-based approach was used as that by Shen et al. (2018) to generate annual forest maps (1986–2016). The difference was that the newly produced PALSAR-based FNF data in Section 2.4 were used to integrate with Landsat-based phenological variables to map the forest, because PALSAR-based forest is often confused with other categories, for example, the commission error between forest and crops and grasses because of their different phenological patterns [58], or having some omission error associated with urban (buildings) and other features (Figure 4) in the performance of the similar PALSAR backscatter coefficients. The NDVImax Gaussian kernel densities for training ROIs of the forest, other types, water, cropland, and urban were plotted (Figure 5). Figure 5 shows that forest has higher NDVImax values, follow by cropland, others, and urban, therefore, the highest Landsat-based NDVI vegetation greenness variables (NDVImax) can be derived to differentiate similar high backscatter coefficients and different phenological patterns between forest and other non-forest (Figure 5) based on the previous studies [36,64]. That is, statistical analysis based on the training ROIs among all of the types showed that the threshold value (greater than or equal to 0.72, a black dashed in Figure 5) of NDVImax was used to separate 80% of the forest pixels (>0.72) from 80% of the others’ pixels (<0.72), 85% of the forest pixels (>0.72) from 85% of the cropland pixels (<0.72), 95% of the forest pixels (>0.72) from 99% of the water pixels (<0.72), and 95% of the forest pixels (>0.72) from 99% of the urban pixels (<0.72) (Figure 5). To reduce the error of the PALSAR-based forest (Figure 4) and further solve the mixed classified forest, a rule was built to eliminate those misclassified pixels in forest (commission error) and identify forest from other classified pixels (omission error) as follows: assume the PALSAR-based forest from Section 2.4 as 1, the PALSAR-based non-forest as 0; then, if PALSAR-based forest = 1 and ndvimax > 0.72, then a pixel is classified as forest to avoid the commission error; or if PALSAR-based non-forest = 0 and ndvimax > 0.72, then it is also classified as forest to avoid the omission error. Next, a median filter (window size 5 × 5) was adopted to solve speckle noise issues (e.g., salt-and-pepper noise) in the annual forest maps. Due to no long time-series PALSAR data, we used the PALSAR data in 2007 and 2015 to detect forest cover before 2007, and from 2011–2015, respectively (Figure 2). It was then deduced that the 2007 and 2015 PALSAR data produced the most accurate maximum forest area (8.27 × 106 ha, 9.06 × 106 ha, respectively) from the Chinese national forestry yearbook (1986–2007, 2011–2015, respectively) (Figure 2) [58]. The land cover maps from 1986–2006 (2011–2015) were substituted by the PALSAR-based land cover map in 2007 (2015), then the above rule was also applicable to other years of forest/non-forest mapping (Figure 2). 2.5.2. Evaluation of PALSAR/Landsat-Based Forest MapsA confusion matrix based on the validation plots was selected to assess the eventual forest maps. Half of the total plots for forests and non-forests were acquired based on data from Google Earth, NFI, and sub-compartment data from 2005 (520 polygons, 1641 polygons), 2010 (487 polygons, 1833 polygons), and 2016 (505 polygons, 1888 polygons) (Figure 2).", 2.

504,"In this study, a similar pixel-based approach was used as that by Shen et al. (2018) to generate annual forest maps (1986–2016). The difference was that the newly produced PALSAR-based FNF data in Section 2.4 were used to integrate with Landsat-based phenological variables to map the forest, because PALSAR-based forest is often confused with other categories, for example, the commission error between forest and crops and grasses because of their different phenological patterns [58], or having some omission error associated with urban (buildings) and other features (Figure 4) in the performance of the similar PALSAR backscatter coefficients. The NDVImax Gaussian kernel densities for training ROIs of the forest, other types, water, cropland, and urban were plotted (Figure 5). Figure 5 shows that forest has higher NDVImax values, follow by cropland, others, and urban, therefore, the highest Landsat-based NDVI vegetation greenness variables (NDVImax) can be derived to differentiate similar high backscatter coefficients and different phenological patterns between forest and other non-forest (Figure 5) based on the previous studies [36,64]. That is, statistical analysis based on the training ROIs among all of the types showed that the threshold value (greater than or equal to 0.72, a black dashed in Figure 5) of NDVImax was used to separate 80% of the forest pixels (>0.72) from 80% of the others’ pixels (<0.72), 85% of the forest pixels (>0.72) from 85% of the cropland pixels (<0.72), 95% of the forest pixels (>0.72) from 99% of the water pixels (<0.72), and 95% of the forest pixels (>0.72) from 99% of the urban pixels (<0.72) (Figure 5).

507,"Annual forest maps derived from the PALSAR/Landsat-based FNF were used to provide forest change data to map the spatial pattern of afforestation distribution from 1986–2016 (Figure 2). Persisting forest (non-forest) indicated that the cover type of a pixel remained the forest (non-forest) during the entire observation period of the annual forest maps. Annual afforestation (e.g., 2016) was generated as the intersection between persisting non-forest from the year before the current year (e.g., 2015) to the starting year (e.g., 1986) of the entire annual forest maps and forest in the current year (e.g., 2016) (Figure 6). Per five (or four, or six) years afforestation (e.g., 2011–2016) was generated as the intersection between persisting non-forest from the start year (e.g., 2010) of the per time interval (e.g., 2010–2016) to the start year (e.g., 1986) of the entire annual forest maps and forest in the end year (e.g., 2016) of the per time interval (Figure 6). The forest AGB time-series stack was produced using ICESat/GLAS measurements, historical inventory data, and time-series optical and radar imagery. Further information about the algorithm is available in Shen et al. (2018). The combined remotely sensed algorithm for mapping AGB yielded a good accuracy (R2adj = 0.86, n = 558, p < 0.001, RMSE = 11.35 t/ha). We estimated the forest cover area by afforestation and quantified AGB change depending on the “RF-based GLAS waveform—extrapolated footprint AGB model”. The AGB time series stack was intersected with the above annual map of forest cover (Figure 6). The final annual AGB map with forest cover change map was clipped by the study area boundary. The trend of forest cover area changed due to afforestation associated with forest AGB (""afforestation-AGB"") was counted based on individual year (e.g., 1990, 1995, 2000,..., 2010, 2016 ) or time intervals (e.g., 1987–1990, 1991–1995,..., 2006–2010, 2011–2016).", 2.

508,"The parallel processing technique used on a regular single desktop computer increased the image computation efficiency per scene (referring to the Landsat footprint) approximately 9–10 times and had a shorter waiting time of approximately 20 minutes than the traditional per scene processing (more than 3 hours) (Code S1), and this was conducive to enhancing the efficiency of the classifiers for the PALSAR-based classification.Table S1 shows the accuracy assessment of the PALSAR-based land cover classifications with ground-truth-based regions of interest (ROI) using four classifiers (SVM, RF, SGB, and C5.0). A total of 555 (546) ground truth forest polygon ROIs, 201 (186) water polygon ROIs, 467 (635) other polygon ROIs, 508 (588) cropland polygon ROIs, and 558 (631) urban polygon ROIs in 2007 (2016) were used for validation. The overall accuracy range of the four algorithms was 58.02–63.61% and 61.49–62.34% in 2007 and 2016, respectively. The Kappa coefficient range was 0.466–0.535 and 0.502–0.513 in 2007 and 2016, respectively. In regard to the over accuracy, the SGB (RF) classifier was superior to the other classifiers, followed by the SVM (SGB) in 2007 (2016), respectively. Due to the consideration of user accuracy, the SGB classification results were the most effective among the four algorithms, especially for forest classification. However, in terms of producer accuracy, SVM classification results for forest classification were superior to other algorithms. Overall, any index may not separately determine which algorithm (SGB, SVM) was the best, while the SGB-based results showed a good balance of these indexes.In the rendered plot (Figure 7), it can be observed that water and forest were identified as items belonging to all of the other classes in 2007 and 2016. The annual land cover maps with 30 m resolution from PALSAR were created using four classifiers. Figure 8 and Figure S2 show the land cover classification map in 2007 and 2016, respectively.

509,"The validation results of the PALSAR/Landsat-based forest maps with ROIs were demonstrated in Table 4 and Table S2. Ground truth forest polygon ROIs and non-forest ROIs were collected in 2005 (555, 1734), 2010 (518, 1968), and 2016 (546, 2043) for validation. The overall accuracy was over 75% (95% CI: 75.11–78.6% in 2005), and up to approximately 85% (95% CI: 83.28–86.2% in 2010). The Kappa coefficient was over 0.45, and up to approximately 0.58. In regard to the producer accuracy, the PALSAR/Landsat-based forest mapping (85.5%) was superior to the PALSAR-based SGB forest mapping (66.48%, Table S1) in 2016. Apart from the user accuracy, the final results presented that the integration of the PALSAR-based SGB classification and the maximum value of NDVI (“SGB-NDVI”)-based forest map had much better accuracy than that of the single PALSAR classification of FNF in Section 3.1.", 3.

510,"Originally, the overall accuracy of global land cover (GLC30) product for the year 2010 from Landsat TM/ETM+ and HJ-1 was 83.5% ± 0.18%, and the user accuracy of the forest classification was 89.00% [19]. Here, the differences between the overall accuracy of the forest classification from GLC30 (85.8%) and our results (SGB-NDVI-based FNF map) (84.8%) are less compared to the discrepancies between the JAXA PALSAR-FNF (80.7%) and our results for the entire Guangdong scale (Table 5 and Table S3). An assessment of forest and non-forest from the integrated forest z-score (IFZ)-based vegetation change tracker (VCT) product and our results in northern Guangdong (p122r043) was performed. This was used to show that the VCT-based forest product (90.3%) was superior to our results (86.1%) with regards to the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient at a small scale (Table 5 and Table S3).The total forest area from the SGB-NDVI-based forest map in 2010 was calculated to be 8.53 × 106 ha in Guangdong, which was close to the results of the national forestry yearbook of China (8.74 × 106 ha), but lower than the calculation from the GLC30 map (9.59 × 106 ha) and higher than the calculation from the JAXA PALSAR-FNF map (7.83 × 106 ha). The areas of the PALSAR-based forest maps in Section 3.1 were about 8.33 × 106 ha, 8.13 × 106 ha, 8.22 × 106 ha, and 8.30 × 106 ha by SGB, SVM, RF, and C5.0 classifiers in 2010, respectively, which were lower than that of the SGB-NDVI-based forest map and the national forestry yearbook.", 3.

511,"The annual forest cover change maps under afforestation (Figure 9) were created using the afforestation spatial pattern calculation based on the method in Figure 6. The trend of forest cover area changed due to afforestation associated with forest AGB was shown in Figure 10. Overall, the trend in afforestation area closely corresponded with the trend in forest AGB, except for a couple of notable anomalies. In Guangdong, the highest afforestation area and AGB value was observed during the period of 1991–1995, while the lowest was during the period from 2006–2010 (Figure 10a). In a single year, the afforestation area and forest AGB value tended to increase to the maximum, followed by a decrease up until 2010, then they continued to rise (Figure 10b). Northern Guangdong (p122r043/p121r043) (Figure 10c, d) was tested due to the highest forest AGB of the entirety of Guangdong Province [58]. The dramatic decline in the afforestation area was significant in 2000 (Figure 10d). Unlike Heyuan, Qingyuan City and Shaoguan City (p122r043) had no obvious fluctuation.", 3. Results, 3.4.

512," 4.1.1. Choice of Mapping AlgorithmsA variety of algorithms sensitive to land cover type classification were investigated. HH, HV, ratio, and difference contributed more in the separability evaluation of PALSAR-based classification, while a conclusion about the limited potential of the HV-based texture measures has been drawn (Figure 5), which was opposite to the well performance description in [21], because the training areas included pixels near from the edge, and texture measures are strongly influenced near edges due to the mixed pixels, especially in large analysis windows or multiscale analysis [65].The overall accuracy (Kappa coefficients) of PALSAR-based classifications using SVM, RF, SGB, and C5.0 were not higher than 65% (0.54), showing the defects of the PALSAR-based land cover type mapping results directly because of the low accuracy, which can be explained as due to the PALSAR data lacking some regions because of the strong ionospheric distortion, especially near the image edge [66]. Otherwise, there were color differences between two adjacent scenes in the mosaic images, which may have been caused by changes in the backscatter intensity induced by the freezing of trees in winter [67], which ultimately affected the PALSAR-based classification of forest and non-forest. However, the SGB classifier contributed more steadily, although there was a discrepancy from the previous study [68]. Also, the area of the SGB-based forest classification in 2010 (8.33 × 106 ha) was closest to the true survey data (8.74 × 106 ha) from the national forestry yearbook of China among all of the classifiers. Usually, although specific parameter tuning of four classifiers need to be adjusted, the basic and default parameters used in classification can satisfy needs; for example, the SGB model is quite sophisticated since changing any setting can affect the optimal values of other settings [69]. Moreover, high biomass crops were likely to be misclassified as forest, as the seamless PALSAR mosaic product was generated using the SAR image every summer from July to September, and the image data acquisition dates are equivalent to crop maturity dates with high biomass [70]. Some of the raw strips comprising each tile were acquired during the wet season, the dielectric constant of moisture or water can affect radar backscatter [71] and may influence the results of the analysis.After the integration of the Landsat-based NDVImax variable with PALSAR, the forest/non-forest classification led to accuracies (Kappa coefficients) ascension of up to 85% (0.6) in the current work. The area of the FNF in 2010 has gone up than that of the PALSAR-based FNF classification. Because the commission error and omission error between forest and non-forest has been improved, especially the urban (buildings) areas were included from the PALSAR/Landsat forest maps, while the croplands (or other types) were excluded led to the discrepancy of 0.2 × 106 ha between the true survey data and PALSAR/Landsat forest maps (SGB-NDVI-based forest map) (Figure 5 and Figure 6). It was a converse result with Qing et al. 2016, where after including Landsat NDVImax, about 10% (~ 4000 km2) of shrub, buildings, and rocky land were reduced in the area of the PALSAR/Landsat forest maps, and no obvious increase had been found. Moreover, Landsat observations during the vegetation growing season are limited. In the northern areas of Guangdong, the accumulated NDVI value during the dry season does not fully represent local phenological information because tree species are not completely evergreen, resulting in the underestimation of forest cover. So, when possible, wet season Landsat images were also included to produce the accumulated NDVI value for the full year. Generally, the number of dry season data that were used was more than the number of the wet season data. With sufficient quantity and superior quality without regard to the wet season, the maximum NDVI of dry season Landsat data can achieve good performance [58]. The accuracy of forest cover maps during the years without PALSAR data also had acceptable accuracy (Table 4 and Table S2). Actually, many other time-series of vegetation indices (EVI, GNDVI, and NDWI) have been used to estimate vegetation phenology; however, most of them were derived from coarse resolution imagery from MODIS [53,72,73] or AVHRR observations [74]. 4.1.2. Comparisons of Forest Cover Maps and the Existing ResultsIn view of the different definitions, data sources, and mapping methods that have been used to map forest cover [75], there are striking differences among land cover maps [36,76]. The forest area from GLC30 was obviously greater in extent than that found in the national forestry yearbook of China and in our results, which may have resulted from the fact that the sparse woodland was also regarded as forest [19]. The Landsat-based VCT algorithm is used to detect dense time-series forest changes and the VCT-based forest/non-forest product achieved outstanding performance; however, it must rely on images from the peak vegetation growing season [23], but these imageries cannot be guaranteed to be accurate in coastal or low-latitude regions. In a comparison of these results with forest maps created by an integration of the JAXA PALSAR global FNF map [21] and Landsat by Shen et al. (2018), we found the forest area of the latter was lower. The validation accuracy of the results generated using the “SGB-NDVI” algorithm was superior to that of the JAXA PALSAR FNF product [21]. This is because the JAXA PALSAR-based forest from the FNF map is defined as areas with canopy cover of natural forests over 10%, and the area must be larger than 0.5 ha (http://www. eorc.jaxa.jp/ALOS/en/palsar_fnf/DatasetDescription_PALSAR2_Mosaic_FNF_revE.pdf). However, in addition to natural forests, there are a wide range of planted forests in southern China. The evaluation indexes (overall accuracy, Kappa coefficient, user accuracy, producer accuracy, and area) of the findings from this study were acceptable when time-series forest classification maps were produced that were based on an active- and passive-based improved algorithm.", 4.

515,"We examined the forest cover change dynamics. The forest area consisting of planted forests from 2006–2010 increased by 0.63 × 106 ha in Guangdong based on the national forestry year book of China, while that of afforestation was 0.59 × 106 ha. This difference is because the definition of planted forests contains new afforestation [55]. The local government proposed a fast-growing eucalyptus plan in 1995 and the eucalyptus plan and slope improvement plans were discontinued in 2000. Furthermore, urban expansion possibly affected AGB changes under afforestation across Guangdong Province, which resulted in afforestation area combined with forest AGB increase and undulation, as Heyuan City in northern Guangdong (p121043) was the first to ban eucalyptus tree planting, and explains the sharp decline of afforestation area in 2000 (Figure 10d). Additionally, because the area covered by p121r043 is adjacent to the southwest area of Jiangxi Province, afforestation projects have increased in the past 20 years, so there is a large amount of afforestation area.", 4.

517,"In this study, a mapping method to detect changes in forest distribution under afforestation in Guangdong Province of China was developed using a combination of the PALSAR-based mosaic products and the dense time series Landsat-based phenology variable obtained from the Google Earth cloud platform. The final model was used to effectively construct an active- and passive-based forest cover detection framework. As validated by field measurements, the detection model generated reliable forest cover maps with some basic classification errors. By integrating spectral variables and phenology variables, the interannual and seasonal and spatio-temporal dynamics of changes in forest cover due to afforestation change were obtained. The combination of multiple sources and algorithms (advanced computing techniques, the optimal machine learning algorithms and remote sensing information) to develop models is a useful methodology, although inevitably there were some errors generated. This study shows that an integration of active and passive remote sensing data-based big data processing can fill in the lack of image data in low-latitude coastal areas and detect historical forest cover changes caused by afforestation. The findings from our study can improve the automatic identification of forest cover types. Future study could comprehensively incorporate multitemporal satellite observations and in situ measurements including lidar data, hyperspectral data, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), and forest structures (e.g., forest species, leaf area index, and forest age) to produce more accurate forest cover maps. This technique can provide a basis for understanding carbon dynamic related to forest biomass due to planted forests afforestation.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
518,"Wetland ecosystems cover only around 4% (depending on the definition from 2% to 6%) of land [1,2,3] but play an important role by providing ecosystem goods and services at various spatial scales. At the global scale, wetlands accumulate a significant amount of organic carbon [4,5,6] and regulate the regional climate [7]. At the watershed scale, wetlands fulfil an important hydrological function by controlling different components of the water balance such as snow retention [8], flood retention [9,10,11], evapotranspiration [12], and interception [13,14]. At the local scale, wetlands provide food, remove water pollution, retain water (hence, controlling floods), stop sediments, and much more [15]. Despite their importance, human activities, e.g., drainage for the farming and cultivation of crops, caused major changes in these vulnerable ecosystems [16]. Ongoing climate changes will make future efforts to restore or maintain valuable wetland functions more complex [17].One of the most serious threats to maintaining the wetlands services and functions is drought occurring more frequently and severely in recent years [18,19]. Various types of drought can be distinguished: Meteorological (defined in terms of the magnitude of a precipitation shortfall and the duration of this shortfall event), agricultural (defined as a deficit of soil moisture), hydrological (defined as the lowering of surface and subsurface water supply), and socioeconomic (defined in terms of socioeconomic losses caused by other types of drought) [20]. Agricultural drought, through the lowering of groundwater level on wetlands, leads to changes in the physical soil characteristics and mineralization of organic matter by enhanced rates of microbial decomposition [21]. These processes cause the reduction of peat porosity [22,23], which consequently results in the process of the disappearance of plant species, characteristic for wetland habitats (e.g., Valeriana simplicifolia, Epipactis palustris, Eleocharis quinqueflora, Limprichtia cossonii, and Campylium stellatum for studied alkaline fens—Natura 2000 habitat code 7230; and Scheuchzerietalia palustris order, Caricetalia nigrae order, Scheuchzerio-Caricetea class: Comarum palustre and Eriophorum angustifolium for studied transition mires and quaking bogs—Natura 2000 habitat code 7140) [24]. These processes also consequently result in the reduction in the wetland’s water capacity, the increase in air content in the soil and its temperature, and, finally, in higher CO2 emissions to the atmosphere [25,26]. Therefore, the monitoring of drought and its consequences are remarkably important in wetland areas. In agriculture, due to high market demands, a significant number of meteorological and remote sensing drought indicators were developed [27,28,29]. Unfortunately, due to the specificity of wetlands, their monitoring by both traditional and remote sensing techniques is challenging [30] and, therefore, they are less recognized in terms of water stress. In order to assess the occurrence and intensity of droughts in agricultural areas [31], the following indices are used, among others: Soil moisture index [32] or crop water stress index (CWSI) [33]. The CWSI found wide application possibilities [34], among others, in determining the needs of the irrigation of agricultural and horticultural crops [35,36]. The wide range of CWSI applications in addition to agricultural crops includes its use in assessing the water status of trees: Fruit orchards [37,38], olive [39], and almond trees [40]. The advantage of CWSI application is it requires only basic meteorological parameters (air temperature and relative humidity), canopy temperature, and limiting cases derived empirically [41] or theoretically [42]. Hence, this paper describes the potential use of the well-known and widely used health monitoring of agriculture crop CWSI for determining water stress for major European wetland habitats: Alkaline fen, transition mires, and quaking bogs. In order to achieve this goal, non-water-stressed baselines (NWSBs) for these habitats were developed based on field measurements (Section 2.2.2). The CWSI was calculated on two test areas (one for each habitat) based on the unmanned aerial system (UAS) thermal orthophotomosaic (Section 2.3), and field campaigns during UAS acquisitions were conducted. Soil moisture, a fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), and chlorophyll content index (CCI) were measured. Besides field measurements, two meteorological drought indicators (SPI—standardized precipitation index, and SCWB—standardized climatic water balance) were calculated. Finally, field measurement results and meteorological drought indicator values were compared to the CWSI to analyze whether the CWSI can be used as water stress or drought indicators in wetlands.", 1.

519,"The research was conducted on two semi-natural habitats of Natura 2000 (Figure 1). The research of habitat 7230 (alkaline fens) was carried out in the Biebrza National Park area located in north-eastern Poland during the growing season of 2016. The research of habitat 7140 (transition mires and quaking bogs) was carried out in the Janów Forest Landscape Park area in south-eastern Poland during the growing season of 2017. 2.1.1. The Biebrza National ParkResearch for habitat 7230 was carried out in the Upper Biebrza Valley in the area of the Biebrza National Park (Figure 1). The Upper Biebrza Valley is a north-eastern part of the Biebrza Proglacial Stream Valley, which, together with sandurs adjoining from the north, constitutes the largest lowering of north-eastern Poland with a length of approx. 150 km and an area exceeding 2600 km2. The Proglacial Stream Valley constitutes the largest complex of natural peatlands in Central Europe. In relation to the adjacent areas, it has different air thermal and humidity characteristics. This is due to the overlap of climate features associated with the vast areas of peatlands and the main features of north-eastern Poland’s climate, with an average annual temperature of 6–7 °C (1971–2000) [43]. The average annual precipitation from the multiannual term of 1971–2000 is 550–600 mm in this area [43], while the duration of snow cover lasts from 90 to 110 days. The research was carried out in the area near the Szuszalewo village characterized by extensively exploited alkaline peatlands, currently one of the most endangered natural habitats in Europe [44]. In the case of the alkaline peatlands, the groundwater level usually remains at or slightly above the ground surface in optimal conditions. The habitat is characterized by low fertility and a high content of calcium ions. The dominant vegetation is moss-sedge communities (Scheuchzerio-Caricetea nigrae community), characterized by a large floral richness with a large share of rare and protected species, such as Liparis loeselii, or plant species from Menyantho trifoliatae-Sphagnetum teretis, Caricion davallianae, Caricetum rostratae, and Caricetum paniceo-lepidocarpae communities. A very important group of plants within habitat 7230 are mosses, part of which are glacial relics. Changes in groundwater level, as well as the succession toward forest and shrub communities, pose the greatest threat to the habitat. 2.1.2. The Janów Forest Landscape ParkResearch for habitat 7140 was carried out in the Janów Forest Landscape Park, which, together with the neighboring Solska Wilderness, is one of the largest forest complexes in Poland (Figure 1). According to the physiographic division of Poland [45], this area is located in the mesoregion of the Biłgoraj Plain called Puszczańska, which is part of the Sandomierz Basin. The studied area lies in the Lublin district [46], which is relatively warm with an average annual air temperature of 7–8 °C (1971–2000). The average annual precipitation amounts to 550–600 mm (1971–2000) [43], while the time of snow cover lasts from 80 to 90 days. The area of the Janów Forest Landscape Park mainly consists of forest habitats, where the largest area is occupied by mixed wet coniferous forest and fresh coniferous forest. Aquatic-peat and aquatic communities are characterized by the greatest floristic richness. Habitat 7140 (transition mires and quaking bogs), within which the research was carried out, constitutes approximately 400 ha of the area of the Janów Forest Landscape Park. They are mainly peat-filled no-runoff land lowerings with a groundwater level arranged in optimal conditions at or slightly above the ground surface. Vegetation primarily consists of a moss and herbaceous layer, where the moss layer is composed mainly of Sphagnum moss and Bryopsida. Usually, one or two species of plants predominate in the habitat. In the Janów Forest Landscape Park, there are species of plants from Eriophoro angustifolli-Sphagnetum recurvii, Caricetum rostratae, Caricetum lasiocarpae, Eriophorum vaginatum-Sphagnum fallax, or Rhynchosporetum albae communities. Changes in hydrological conditions, as well as the encroachment of trees and shrubs into open wetland areas in the conditions of lowering the groundwater level, pose the greatest threat to habitat 7140.", 2.

522,"Calculation of the CWSI requires the NWSB for investigated habitats. In this section, the formula for CWSI calculation is first presented. Secondly, the methodology of the NWSB derivation is described. 2.2.1. FormulationThe CWSI was calculated according to the following equation [41,42]:

CWSI = (dTm − dTLL)/(dTUL − dTLL),


(1)


where dT is the temperature difference between canopy (Tc) and air (Ta), and the subscripts m, LL, and UL respectively refer to the measured difference and the lower (non-water-stressed) and upper limit of dT. The upper and lower limits of dT can be estimated based on the empirical [41] or theoretical approach [42]. In this study, an empirical approach was used. It is based on the assumption that dTLL is linearly related to the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) for a non-water-stressed habitat patch under specific climatic conditions—this relation is further referred to as the NWSB. Similarly, there is a linear relation between dTUL and the vapor pressure gradient (VPG) for the same habitat patch when its transpiration is halted due to severe water stress. The upper and lower limits were calculated according to the following equations:

dtLL = m∙VPD + b,


(2)



dtUL = m∙VPG + b,


(3)


where “m” and “b” respectively refer to slope and intercept of the NWSB. The VPG was estimated according to [47] based on the saturation vapor pressure (E) at the instantaneous air temperature and E at the instantaneous air temperature elevated by NWSB’s coefficient “b” as their difference: 

VPG = E(Ta) − E(Ta + b).

In this study, the CWSI was calculated based on UAS Tc acquisitions (Section 2.3) conducted simultaneously with the basic meteorological measurements (air temperature and relative humidity). Meteorological measurements were made using a HOBO U23 Pro v2 Temperature/Relative Humidity Data Logger sensor (Onset®, USA). 2.2.2. The NWSB derivationThe NWSB was developed for both investigated habitats based on field and laboratory measurements. In order to develop the NWSB Ta, Tc and VPD need to be measured or calculated. The measurements should be performed when a given habitat is in non-water-stressed conditions under clear sky conditions [47]. Hence, field measurements of canopy temperature, air temperature, and relative humidity (RH) were conducted on dates after a longer period of optimal water conditions (dates were selected based on groundwater level and precipitation monitoring). Based on Ta and RH, the VPD was calculated according to the following formula [48]:

E = 0.6108∙exp[(17.27∙Ta)/(Ta + 237.4)],

525,"The land surface temperature (LST) was recorded over research transects (Figure 1) using a thermal camera installed on the UAS. The research transects were selected based on their availability for UAS (enough space for take-off and landing) and plant coverage. In the selected areas in the growing season, plants are dense enough to assume that LST is equal to canopy temperature. The UAS acquisitions were conducted in 3 field campaigns in the Biebrza National Park and in 5 field campaigns in the Janów Landscape Park (Table 1). For the purposes of this research, the UAS was constructed based on the DJI S1000+ frame (DJI, China) equipped with PIXHAWK autopilot (3D Robotics, USA) with a built-in inertial measurement unit (IMU) system. GNSS navigation data were collected using the Tersus-GNSS Precis BX306 GNSS device (Tersus GNSS China, China), enabling dual-frequency signal recording in both GPS and GLONASS systems. The land surface temperature (LST) was recorded using an Optris PI640 radiometric camera (Optris GmbH, Germany) mounted on a two-axis stabilizing system. Additionally, in order to increase image interpretation possibilities, RGB images were recorded using a UAS DJI Phantom 3 Professional platform (DJI, China). For both, thermal and RGB dataset ground control points (GCPs) were recorded.Flights over the research transects were carried out autonomously along the planned routes, which ensured repeatability of the area extent range that was acquired during subsequent flights. The level of side lap coverage was maintained at a value of at least 75%. The fixed flight parameters allowed a terrain resolution not worse than 10 cm to be obtained. Air operations were carried out in possibly stable weather conditions (wind speed below 5 m/s, clear sky, and no rapid change in air temperature and humidity). When meteorological conditions allowed more flights to be conducted, up to 3 flights per transect were conducted.The coordinates of the projection centers of individual radiometric images were determined based on the GNSS on-board system recorded data. Then, the data set (the image–GPS position pair) was processed in Photoscan software (Agisoft LLC, Russia). The photogrammetric process consisted of generating a sparse point cloud, controlling the initially obtained model, creating a dense cloud of points, creating a digital surface model (DSM), and finally constructing an orthophotomosaic and exporting it to the TIFF format.For improving the geometrical accuracy of the thermal orthophotomosaic additional RGB UAS, reference data were captured and the GCP network was established. A color (RGB) orthophotomosaic was prepared for each of the research transects. The selected flight parameters allowed reference data to be obtained with a terrain resolution higher than 5 cm. The coordinates of each GCP were measured using the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) RTK (Real Time Kinematic) technique using GNSS receiver Topcon GRS-1 (Topcon, Japan) in real-time corrections from the TPI NetPRO network [49]. The GCPs were used during the photogrammetric process to increase the internal coherence and external accuracy of the resulting RGB orthophotomosaic. The obtained error of fitting on the matrix points did not exceed 3 pixels (regarding the resolution of the orthophotomosaic at the level of 5 cm).Next, the LST orthophotomosaic was subjected to final geometric rectification in the QGIS software based on characteristic points identifiable on the RGB orthophotomosaic. First, given that the characteristic point was identified on the LST image, it was then fitted into corresponding coordinates based on the RGB orthophotomosaic. At least 20 points per study area evenly distributed over the image were used. ", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.3. UAS Data Capture and Thermal Orthophotomosaic Preparation,2
526,"Apart from the CWSI, two meteorological drought indices, namely, SPI and SCWB, were calculated with meteorological data (air temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, wind speed) gathered by the Institute of Meteorology and Water Management, National Research Institute (IMGW-PIB) [50]. The SPI and SCWB were selected as the most valuable and reliable meteorological drought indices. Meteorological drought indices were calculated to test which type of drought can be monitored using the CWSI.The SPI was calculated according to the original methodology proposed by [51]. The SPI was calculated as the difference of precipitation from the mean for a specified time period divided by the standard deviation calculated from past records. For the calculation of SPI precipitation, data from the last 30 years were used.The SCWB is a standardized deviation of climatic water balance values in a given period by the mean long-term value of this period [52]. Climatic water balance is calculated as the difference between total precipitation and the reference evapotranspiration. For SCWB calculation, the reference evapotranspiration was calculated according to FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) [48]. Daily values of SCWB for a 30 year data series were calculated.Both indices were calculated for a period of 3 months as a moving average using a dedicated package in the R environment [53].Classifications of the SPI and SCWB values and adopted meteorological drought categories are presented in Table 2.", 2.

527,"The measurements of CCI and fAPAR, as well as the moisture content of the surface soil layer, took place on the dates of the acquisition of UAS data. These parameters describe the habitat condition and water stress of plants. A total of 45 in the Biebrza National Park and 23 in the Janów Forest Landscape Park plots (Figures 3 and 4) with dimensions of 1 x 1 m were established, in which the above-mentioned measurements were carried out. In all plots, plant composition was also noted. Before using these points in statistical analyses, each one was verified on an RGB orthophotomosaic, to exclude disrupted (e.g., by mowing, water, and shadow occurrence) points. In addition, points with the peculiar plant composition were excluded. Droughts affect the vegetation capacity of intercepting solar radiation, which can be described by the fAPAR. The fAPAR determines the fraction of solar radiation that has been absorbed by plants during the photosynthesis. It is expressed by the ratio values of photosynthetically active accumulated radiation to total radiation reaching the surface of plants. The parameter allows the condition of plants and their productivity and the effects of water deficit to be assessed, which are different according to the plant’s growth stage. However, a reduction in the intercepted radiation (and, therefore, in fAPAR) is always a consequence of droughts [54,55]. Measurements of the fAPAR were carried out using the SunScan Canopy Analysis System SS1 system (Delta-T Devices, Ltd., UK). Within each research plot, a total of 10 measurements of fAPAR were carried out and subsequently averaged. The chlorophyll content is one of the major factors influencing photosynthetic capacity. Due to that, changes in chlorophyll content in tissues in a plant under drought stress have been observed in different species. Its intensity depends on the stress rate and duration [56]. Many authors proved that the chlorophyll content of a leaf can be a reliable indicator of photosynthetic capability [57,58]. Fotovat et al. [59] found that by exerting severe drought stress on wheat, the chlorophyll content of a leaf significantly decreased. The CCI measurements were carried out using a CCM200 Chlorophyll Meter (Opti-Sciences, Inc., USA), which uses the transmittance measured in two wavelength ranges of 653 and 931 nm to estimate the relative chlorophyll content in leaves. The CCI value is directly proportional to the actual concentration of chlorophyll in the leaves. The index made it possible to observe changes in the physiological state of dominant plant species under the influence of changing soil moisture that may have caused water stress. CCI measurements were carried out for 10 individuals of each of the 1–3 dominant species found on the research plot in triplicate (on three different leaves), which were then averaged.Measurements of moisture in the surface soil layer (0–10 cm) were carried out at each research plot in triplicate using a time domain reflectometer (TDR) [60]. The obtained results representing dielectric constant (Ka) were averaged to a single value for each plot. The conversion of Ka values into the value of the soil moisture content requires a calibration equation. Authors used their own calibration equations developed in laboratory tests for the soils of 7230 and 7140 habitats in accordance with the methodology presented by [61,62].Additionally, in each study area, piezometers were installed (3 in the Biebrza National Park and 2 in the Janów Forest Landscape Park). Piezometers were equipped with automatic Levelogger® Edge (Solinst Canada Ltd.) sensors, which recorded data of the groundwater level every 3 h. Groundwater level data were averaged for 24 h for each study area.", 2. Materials and Methods ," 2.5. Biophysical Parameters, Soil Moisture, and Groundwater Level",2

Then, results were masked using habitat extent maps (only areas within selected habitats were analyzed). These results allowed the CWSI to be analyzed spatially and temporally (Section 3.2). In the second step, CWSI values were compared to precipitation, temperature, groundwater level, and meteorological drought indices (Section 3.3). In the last step, field measurements of biophysical parameters and soil moisture were used to analyze the correlation between them and CWSI values (Section 3.4).

Measurements for habitat 7140 were done during the day with VPD values ranging from 0.73 to 1.89 kPa and observed the temperature difference between the canopy and air ranging from 2.1 °C to 12.9 °C. To analyze the applicability to wider meteorological conditions, measurements were repeated in the laboratory on a representative habitat sample. For habitat 7230, VPD values ranged from 1.03 to 1.87 kPa and temperature differences ranged from –0.9 °C to 11.0 °C.

530,"The results of CWSI calculations are presented on maps within the flight extent (Figure 3 and Figure 4) and on boxplots for each research area and transect (Figure 5). The significance of median differences in CWSI values between particular field campaigns in both areas was checked using the Kruskal–Wallis test in the R environment [63]. For both areas, differences in CWSI values were significant at the level of p < 0.05.The CWSI calculation results for the Biebrza National Park (Figure 3 and Figure 5) showed the lowest values (median equal to −0.012) during the first measurement campaign (24.07.2016). In the next campaign on 07.09.2016, the median value increased to −0.008. In this campaign, the range of CWSI values was higher than in the first one. Further (in the last campaign), the CWSI achieved the highest values (median equal to 0.034). The spatial distribution of CWSI values in the second and third campaign showed higher CWSI values in the northern part of the two studied transects and the western part of the west transect. This part of the transect was mowed just before the second field campaign. Hence, the results showed a visible spatial pattern of CWSI and the consequent likelihood that vegetation is subject to water stress in this area. The calculation results for the area of Janów Forest Landscape Park (Figure 4 and Figure 5) show low values (median equal to 0.018) of CWSI during the first measurement campaign (14.07.2017). Then, the CWSI reaches its maximum (median equal to 0.165) during the second measurement campaign (1.08.2017). Further, the values of the CWSI gradually decrease, reaching a minimum (median equal to −0.046) during the last measurement campaign (09.09.2017). The spatial distribution of CWSI values in the first four campaigns showed the lowest values of CWSI in the southern part of the flight area (Figure 5). In the fifth campaign, nearly all of the research area was characterized by CWSI values below 0 and the southern part did not stand out significantly. Apart from the temporal pattern of water stress, the CWSI also showed spatial variability and indicated parts of natural habitats that were less vulnerable to water stress caused by droughts. The field assessment confirmed the better overall condition of plants in locations where small ponds were present.", 3. Results, 3.2. CWSI,3
531,"The course of hydrometeorological data in the Biebrza National Park (Figure 6A) corresponds to temporal changes in the CWSI observed within the flight extent (Figure 5A). In the first field campaign (24.07.2016), in the major part of the research area, CWSI values were below 0 (indicating the occurrence of the appropriate habitat conditions through the research period). During this campaign, the groundwater level (determining the availability of water for plants) was the highest (−10 cm), due to the earlier long period with precipitation, and remained higher than −15 cm until the end of August, where it started to decrease until the end of the growing season in September. However, we observed a slight increase at the beginning of September, which was caused by two days with high precipitation. The fluctuation of the CWSI values showed increases in the second (07.09.2016) and third (18.09.2016) campaign, representing less water availability.The values of hydrometeorological parameters in the Janów Forest Landscape Park (Figure 6B) correspond to the temporal change in the CWSI in a flight extent (Figure 5B) as it was observed in the Biebrza National Park. In the first field campaign (14.07.2017), the CWSI values were above 0 in the major part of the research area (indicating the occurrence of average hydrological conditions through the research period). During this campaign, the groundwater level was equal to −21 cm. In the second field campaign (01.08.2017), groundwater level decreased to −30 cm and the CWSI reached its maximum. In the third field campaign (19.08.2017), the CWSI indicated the occurrence of better habitat conditions than in the second one (01.08.2017), although the groundwater level reached the lowest value (−58 cm). The cause was higher air temperature (hence, vapor pressure deficit as well) in the second campaign, and this parameter plays a crucial role in CWSI determination. After the third field campaign (19.08.2017), the groundwater level started to rise and the CWSI values correspond to this change (air temperature in the last three campaigns was similar). In the fourth field campaign (30.08.2017), the groundwater level was equal to −33 cm and the CWSI was slightly higher than in the first field campaign. In the last field campaign (09.09.2017), when the groundwater level reached −13 cm, the CWSI values were the lowest (in major part lower than 0) through the whole research period. The SPI values for the Biebrza National Park (Figure 7A) in all campaigns were slightly above 0, indicating non-meteorological drought conditions. The SPI values were equal to 0.062, 0.039, and 0.085 for the first, second, and third campaigns, respectively. The SCWB values for the Biebrza National Park (Figure 7A) in all campaigns indicated mild drought with values equal to −0.484, −0.346, and −0.086 for the first, second, and third campaign, respectively.In the Janów Forest Landscape Park in all campaigns (besides the third one), the SPI had low positive values (Figure 7B), indicating non-meteorological drought conditions. In the third campaign, the SPI value increased significantly and was equal to 2.275. The SCWB in the first, fourth, and fifth campaigns was equal to −0.285, −0.579, and −0.844 respectively. These values indicate mild drought conditions. In the second campaign, the SCWB value dropped significantly and was equal to −1.989, indicating severe drought. Similar to the SPI, in the third campaign, the SCWB increased significantly and was equal to 2.293. The lowest values of both indices were observed in the second campaign (01.08) when the highest values of CWSI (Figure 5B) were observed. In the third campaign, high values of CWSI (Figure 5B) were observed, but both meteorological drought indices had the highest values and did not correspond to CWSI indications. The precipitation that occurred on the 19th and 20th of August was 37.6 mm and affected the SPI and SCWB results in the third campaign. It should be noted that the CWSI in this campaign (19.08.2017) was calculated based on the flight done a few hours before precipitation in more water-stressed conditions.", 3. Results, 3.3.

532,"All CWSI values from all research plots were plotted against field measurements of soil moisture (Figure 8A), CCI (Figure 8B), and fAPAR (Figure 8C). The number of points used for analysis, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and its p-value for the plotted correlation are presented in Table 4.As expected, CWSI is inversely proportional for biophysical parameters values. The absolute value of correlation coefficients for soil moisture and fAPAR (Table 4) is higher than 0.5, showing a strong correlation between this parameter and CWSI. The CCI correlation coefficient (Table 4) shows a weaker correlation than the two other parameters. All three relations are statistically significant. Observed values of Pearson’s correlation coefficient indicate that the CWSI can be used as a water stress indicator for wetland ecosystems. High CWSI values (indicating water stress) correspond to low values of the measured parameters (also indicating water stress).", 3. Results, 3.4. Correlation of CWSI and Field Measurements ,3
533,"This study attempted to use the well-known crop water stress index in two selected wetland habitats (namely, alkaline fens, transition mires, and quaking bogs). Calculation of the CWSI requires the NWSB, which can be estimated based on a theoretical approach [41] or empirical [42] approach. Previously conducted research analyzed CWSI mainly for monitoring the health status of crops [34,41,42,47,64], fruit orchards [37,65], olive trees [39], and almond trees [40]. The authors did not find studies on CWSI on wetland habitats, especially in a temperate climate. Therefore, for the investigated habitats, the NWSB was developed (Section 3.1). The parameters (m and b) of the NWSB for both habitats are significantly different from each other, and so are values found in the literature for different vegetation types. This is a reflection of differences between these two habitats. Habitat 7140 in the Janów Forest Landscape Park was developed in no-runoff land lowerings and is fed by rainwater, while habitat 7230 in the Biebrza National Park is fed mainly by water from upland and the Biebrza River. In addition, different plant compositions for these habitats have an impact on the NWSB parameters. NWSB parameters (m and b) elaborated for the studied habitats differ significantly from those found in the literature for different vegetation types. These differences might be caused by different soil types (this research was conducted on organic soils) and its moisture.The NWSB was developed based on one-day measurements in conditions described by [36]. UAS flights conducted in the scope of this research were done in similar meteorological conditions (Ta and VPD) as measurements for NWSB development. However, the variation in VPD (one of the main drivers of CWSI) was small for habitat 7230 (from 1.03 kPa to 1.87 kPA); for that reason, this obtained NWSB should be applied carefully. The field variation of VPD for habitat 7140 was also small (from 0.73 to 1.89 kPa), but measurements in the laboratory allowed the response of the habitat to be checked in a wider range of conditions (VPD from 0.38 to 2.13 kPa).", 4. Discussion, 4.1. The NWSB for Wetland Habitats,4
534,"Meteorological drought is the first step of drought caused by a lack of atmospheric precipitation. Longer periods without precipitations (duration depends on habitat specification) lead to a shortage of water availability and plant stress. Comparison of the CWSI and two meteorological drought indices (Section 3.3) shows that the CWSI is not an effective meteorological drought indicator for wetland habitats.In the Biebrza National Park (habitat 7230), both investigated meteorological indices had similar values during UAS flights (SPI slightly above 0 in all campaigns and SCWB value ranging from –0.5 to 0) (Figure 7A); in the same time, the CWSI values between campaigns were significantly different (Figure 5A). This shows that the meteorological parameters used for SPI and SCWB calculations do not fully describe physiological drought in this habitat. Water availability is crucial for plant condition. A good indicator of water availability is groundwater level. In our research area, groundwater level changes (Figure 6A) do not correspond to meteorological drought indicators. This is due to the fact that this area is fed not only by rainwater, but also by groundwater from upland and river water.In the Janów Forest Landscape Park (habitat 7140), meteorological indicators (SPI and SCWB) correspond better to the UAS-based CWSI (Section 3.3). Besides one campaign, higher values of CWSI agree with lower values of SPI and SCWB. Disagreement in the third campaign is a result of the short but intensive precipitation in the day of UAS acquisition and the day after. Both indices were calculated based on the moving average. By contrast, the CWSI was calculated based on the thermal orthophotomosaic prepared for one point in time (after a long period without precipitation and/or just before intensive precipitation). For this habitat (similarly to habitat 7230), the CWSI matches the changes in groundwater level. However, due to the way of habitat water supply (mainly by precipitation), the CWSI values correspond better to drought indices than in the case of habitat 7230.Besides the disagreement of CWSI and meteorological drought indices indications, disagreements between both meteorological indices were found. The SCWB values more often indicated drought than the SPI values. For the SPI calculation, only precipitation was used, whereas for the SCWB, evapotranspiration data were also used. The evapotranspiration is an important part of water balance in the wetland, hence the high affected indices results obtained. ", 4. Discussion, 4.2. CWSI as Drought Indicator in Wetland Habitats,4
535,"Plant water stress is connected to a limited amount of water in the rhizosphere. Water stress is causing simultaneous changes in physiological and morphological characteristics in all plant organisms. Analysis of pigment concentrations in leaves is important in plant ecophysiological studies, providing significant information about physiological responses to environmental factors such as drought [66]. Measurements of relative chlorophyll content allow information to be obtained on vegetation condition in a given area. On the other hand, because water deficit leads to a reduction in biomass accumulation, the criteria of plant productivity should also be used [67]. Therefore, in this research, as an indicator of water stress, groundwater level, soil moisture, fAPAR, and CCI were used. For all selected water stress indicators, their relation (strong in the case of soil moisture and fAPAR or weak but still significant for CCI) with CWSI can be observed. Lowering of the groundwater levels in both research areas (Figure 6) correspond to the increase in observed CWSI values (Figure 5). A significant Pearson’s correlation coefficient above 0.6 for the relation between the CWSI and soil moisture (Figure 8A) confirms the dependence of CWSI and water availability for plants. In wetland habitats, the optimal soil moisture is above 90%. Negative values of the CWSI for soil moisture in this range indicate no stress conditions. However, the majority of CWSI values have positive values, indicating the occurrence of water stress conditions.It can be found in the literature that values of fAPAR and CCI correspond to changes in plant condition related to its water stress [66,67]. Its intensity depends on the stress rate and duration [56]. Fotovat et al. [59] found that by exerting severe drought stress on wheat, the chlorophyll content of a leaf significantly decreased. The chlorophyll content is one of the major factors influencing photosynthetic capacity [54,57,58], proving that it can be its reliable indicator. Droughts also affect the vegetation’s capacity of intercepting solar radiation, which can be described by fAPAR. Effects of water deficit are different according to the plant’s growth stage. However, a reduction in the intercepted radiation (and, therefore, in fAPAR) is always a consequence of drought [54,55].Therefore, the correlation of measured biophysical parameters and CWSI (Figure 8B,C) supports the hypothesis that the CWSI can be used in wetland habitats as a water stress indicator. However, in this research, weak CWSI correlation with CCI was due to the fact that the measurements were performed not for each plant or species present in the research plot but for the dominant species only. CCI values differ not only between species but also between individuals. Despite the measurements performed for each research plot, 10 individuals for each dominant in triplicate (on three different leaves) obtained CCI values (even averaged) do not correspond accurately to the averaged CWSI values obtained from UAS data, as they do not represent the whole variability occurring in a given plot. The reason is also the inability to perform CCI measurements for bryophytes, whose percentage in the analyzed area was quite large (80–100%). However, CCI measurements performed in this study on dominant plant species and other field observations were used to monitor condition changes in time, allowing us to also expect changes in CWSI values.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. CWSI as Water Stress Indicator in Wetland Habitats,4
536,"In the scope of this research, new NWSBs for two non-forest Natura 2000 habitats (code 7140 and 7230) were developed. Obtained NWSB parameters for both habitats were different. This is a reflection of the high diversity of wetland habitats. The further application of CWSI should be supported with ground truth data collection and, in the case of different wetland habitats types, preceded by the NWSB derivation.The results of the analysis clearly show that CWSI cannot be used as a meteorological drought indicator. It results in the fact that these indices are calculated based on precipitation and evapotranspiration. The wetland areas are fed not only by rainwater; hence, the lack of precipitation does not have to lead to water stress. Moreover, evapotranspiration plays an important role in the wetlands, but its direct measurements are still challenging and all estimations are biased. Hence, simple metrological drought indicators might describe wetland conditions incorrectly. Biophysical parameters describing plant condition related to its water stress (fAPAR and CCI) significantly correlated with the CWSI values. The correlation of CCI was not as strong as for fAPAR, but it was a result of the used measurement methodology. Further analyses should include bryophytes for habitats that are characterized by their high coverage. However, due to their morphology, this requires specialized sensors, and measurement in the field becomes even more time-consuming. Together with CWSI correlation with soil moisture and the correspondence of CWSI values to fluctuations in the groundwater level, it shows that the CWSI can be used in the wetland habitat as a water stress indicator.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
537,"Tree growth is influenced by several factors, including climate patterns, site conditions, and competition processes [1,2,3,4] Among them, tree competition measures are the main predictors of individual trees’ growth [5]. Competition among trees is defined as the negative effects that neighboring trees have on a subject tree. These negative effects depend on the interactions between trees in acquiring limited resources, such as light, water, and nutrients [6,7]. Quantifying the competitive effect of neighboring trees is difficult due to the co-occurring effects of various environmental factors on trees.Many indices have been developed in numerous studies in order to quantify the level of competition that individual trees experience, and to assess how competition affects growth rates (e.g., [8,9,10,11,12]). Competition models, based on competition indices of single trees, can be classified into two main groups: distance-independent and distance-dependent models [13,14,15,16]. Distance-independent models use only non-spatial competition indices. These indices are based on the size distribution of competitor trees within a given area, without considering their spatial distribution. Differently, distance-dependent models are based on spatial competition indices that incorporate both the size and the spatial distribution of competitors [17]. Distance-dependent indices may offer more reliable forecasts of the growth of single trees [18,19], as tree size, species composition, and stand structure vary within a stand and, consequently, the availability of resources [20]. In forests with a spatially inhomogeneous distribution of trees, and in particular in unmanaged mountainous areas, there is usually stronger growth competition between neighboring trees and thus biomass growth can be more easily influenced by the available light intensity and site quality.Several studies (e.g., [16,21]) found that the canopy neighborhood plays a key role in understanding tree competition. Therefore, the availability of light is probably a determining factor for the growth of individual trees [22,23,24,25]. However, species-specific differences in crown characteristics may influence light capture differently in different canopy classes [26]. Yet, the co-occurrence of species that differ in their root architecture may improve the uptake of nutrients and water [27,28]. Below-ground competition does not only consider the interactions between dominant and/or subdominant trees with the subject tree but also those trees whose roots occupy the root distribution area of the subject tree [29]. These differences in functional traits for the capture and assimilation of resources (such as light, water, and nutrients) may lead to changes in biomass partitioning and, therefore, change the productivity of forests. According to Fox et al. [30], the productive potential of forest stands can be greatly increased by competition. Competition is linked to the acquisition of environmental resources by species in close spatial proximity, so changes in biomass partitioning may affect the productivity of forests [31,32]. Many studies (e.g., [33,34]) have investigated the relationship between biomass partitioning and plant competition. For example, Lin et al. [34] showed that the allocation of biomass can vary due to different types of competition, above and below ground. Increased competition among trees due to the limitation of underground resources can lead to changes in roots’ biomass [35]. Furthermore, according to Petersen et al. [36], removal of the effects of competition in a controlled environment led to an increase in the above ground biomass of Douglas fir. These studies suggest that competition is closely related to biomass partitioning, and biomass distribution directly affects forest productivity. Furthermore, according to Zhou et al. [33], biomass distribution directly affects forest productivity, and productivity is closely related to forest competition.Obtaining information regarding the spatial distribution of individual trees, and their height, diameter, crown projection, and biomass requires methods based on field measurements. Although these conventional techniques provide reasonably accurate estimates, they often require labor-intensive and time-consuming measurements and inspections. Moreover, the measurements are always limited to small areas while in many cases, it is necessary to have measurements over large areas. Therefore, the use of remote sensing, in particular of light detection and ranging (lidar) remote sensing technology, partially overcomes these limitations. Several methods have been developed using airborne lidar metrics (e.g., [37,38,39]) for the estimation of forest biomass and volume (e.g., [40]), and other forest characteristics (e.g., [41]). The majority of the studies in the literature have focused on the prediction of volume and biomass, many on forest structure, and few on competition. As an example, Lo et al. [42] predicted volume, DBH, and a height-based competition index using lidar metrics at the individual tree level. Relating volume and DBH to the competition index, they showed that they are negatively related. Similarly, Lin et al. [43] showed that by using a lidar-based height competition index it is possible to predict the aboveground carbon density of individual trees. Ma et al. [44] predicted tree growth in terms of an increase in height crown area and crown volume using bi-temporal airborne lidar data and they related this to some competition indices.The objective of this study was to use lidar metrics to predict competition indices and to show how they relate with tree aboveground biomass (AGB). In particular, we focused on two competition indices, one related to height and one to the diameter at breast height (DBH). To the best of our knowledge, no study has explored the possibility of predicting DBH and height competition indices for individual trees detected on lidar data, using lidar metrics extracted both at the plot and ITC level.", 1.

538," 2.1.1. Study AreaThis study was conducted in the Autonomous Province of Trento (Italy), in the municipality of Lavarone (45°57′30.09”N, 11°16′25.17′’E). The study area of approximately 4 km2 (Figure 2) presents an altitude between 1200 and 1600 m above sea level, and it is composed of an uneven-aged forest with patches of mixed-species and pure-forest stands. The average number of trees per hectare is 839.4. In particular, dominant tree species are Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) H. Karst.), about 47% of the total stem volume, and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), about 36% of the total stem volume. Other tree species are present in the study area, although with a low percentage of the total stem volume: European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.) with about 13%, and European larch (Larix decidua Mill.) and Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) with an overall percentage of about 4%. 2.1.2. Lidar DataLidar data were acquired in 2015 by an Optech ALTM 3100EA sensor with a maximum scan angle of 21 degrees. The mean point density was 21.5 points per square meter for the first return. Up to four returns per pulse were measured. A digital terrain model (DTM) was generated from the lidar points by the vendor using the TerraScan software with a grid size of 0.5 m. The lidar point cloud was normalized to create a canopy height model (CHM) by subtracting the DTM from the z values of the lidar pulses. This operation was carried out using the software lasground of the package LAStools (https://rapidlasso.com/).

542,"Competition dynamics were analyzed using distance-dependent individual competition indices (CIs). These indices provide spatial information of the competitive status of an individual tree [49]. In this study, we used the indices proposed by Hegyi [50] in order to represent different combinations of tree characteristics (i.e., DBH and height).The first step to calculate individual-based competition indices for a tree (called the subject tree) is the identification of the trees actively competing with it. A search radius around the subject tree needs to be defined: The radius influences the number of competitors to consider and thus the indices. A too small or too large radius may lead to underestimates or overestimates of the competitive effects between the subject tree and its real competitors [49]. In the literature, different methods to define the neighborhood area are presented. In our case, to evaluate the level of competition for each tree, we considered only the competitors located within a certain radius from the subject tree. Previous studies showed that a search radius of 10 m is sufficiently wide to capture all the competitive effects of neighboring trees [51,52]. In particular Szwagrzyk et al. [53] used a radius of 10 m in an area with similar structural parameters to the area in this study. Thus, we decided to use such a value. Moreover, to avoid edge effects, the competition indices were calculated only for trees positioned less than 10 m from any of the plot borders.Two competition indices were considered in this study, one related to stem DBH and one to tree height. The two indices were calculated using the following formulas [50]:

543,"The delineation of the ITCs was carried out on the lidar data using the delineation algorithm of the R package itcSegment [54]. In particular, we used the function itcLiDAR. A detailed description of the method adopted can be found in [55]. This approach takes as input the canopy height model (CHM) on which local maxima (i.e., treetops) are located, and around them the crowns of the trees are delineated. The approach included three phases: (1) Smoothing of the canopy height model for which a Gaussian low-pass filter is applied to the rasterized CHM to smooth the surface and to reduce the number of potential local maxima; (2) local maxima extraction: A circular moving window of variable size is applied to the smoothed CHM to find a set of potential treetops (local maxima). A pixel of the CHM is identified as a local maximum when its value is greater than the other values contained in the moving window. The window size is defined according to the height of its central pixel and it spans in a range of odd values defined by the user (e.g., 3,5,7,9). If the height of the central pixel is low, a small value of the window size is used and vice versa; and 3) crown region growing: The crown of a tree is identified by the algorithm through the proximity of the pixels to that particular local maximum. A pixel is considered to belong to a specific region when its vertical distance is less than a percentage of a default difference given by the height of the local maximum. This process is repeated until no pixel is added to a region. Once the region is fully grown, a 2D convex hull is applied, resulting in polygons that represent individual trees (ITCs). The algorithm assigns to each delineated ITC a value of height (i.e., the value of the maximum elevation value of the lidar points inside the ITC) and a value of the crown area derived from the convex hull. The input parameters of the function itcLiDAR used in this study were: Resolution 0.5, MinSearchFilSize 3, MaxSearchFilSize 9, TRESHSeed 0.55, TRESHCrown 0.6, minDIST 5, maxDIST 40, HeightThreshold 2, and cw 1. For each ITC, DBH and AGB were predicted using the equations of Jucker et al. [56] implemented in the R package itcSegment considering the temperate coniferous forest as the biome.To generate the ITCs dataset to use in the modelling part, a matching process between delineated ITCs and reference ground observations was done. The matching procedure followed two steps: (1) Candidate search: all ground reference trees falling inside an ITC were considered as matching candidates; (2) candidate vote: selected candidates were ranked by their difference in height with the delineated ITCs and their Euclidean distance to the treetop. A distance metric, D, was estimated by considering both parameters to select the best candidate as follows:

Thus, for each ITC, two sets of metrics were defined: (i) plot metrics: 93 elevation and intensity metrics (see Figure 3) extracted from the first and last return of the lidar point cloud data. For each ITC, we considered lidar points located in an area of radius of 10 m from the ITC location. These metrics were extracted from the entire set of points in the 10-m radius from the ITC location, and they did not depend on the ITCs characteristics. Each metric was extracted from the first return points only (_F), and last return points only (_L); and (ii) ITC metrics: 23 metrics computed on the basis of the ITCs located in a radius of 10 m around the considered ITC (see Figure 4). These metrics were computed combining the characteristics (height, crown area, location, DBH) of the ITCs located in a radius of 10 m from the reference ITC.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Lidar Metrics Extraction,2
545,"To evaluate the efficiency of lidar metrics in modelling the competition indices, ordinary least square (OLS) models were built, in which the dependent variables were the competition indices estimated in the field and the independent variables were the lidar metrics. We developed three models for each competition index: One model using all the ITCs matched with the field data, one using only the ones of silver fir, and one using only the ones of Norway spruce. Before building the regression models, the presence of multicollinearity between the independent variables (the lidar metrics) was evaluated with the function findCorrelation of the R package caret [58]. In order to reduce the number of lidar metrics and to remove the ones most correlated among each other, we set the correlation threshold to 0.9. After this, the OLS models were built using the stepAIC function of the R package MASS. A natural logarithmic transformation of the original independent variables (the competition indices) was performed in order to avoid non-normality. The stepAIC function was restricted in order to reduce/avoid overfitting of the models. In particular, the selection was restricted in order to have at least 10 field samples for each metric selected and to have a value of the accuracy indices,

 model.Among the ITC metrics, five of them were used in the models: CI_H_ITC, CI_DBH_ITC, DBHsumITC, CAmeanITC, and DsdITC. CI_H_ITC is the height competition index (Equation (3)) computed using only the detected ITCs in the 10-m radius from the subject tree and the lidar-predicted heights; CI_DBH_ITC is the DBH competition index (Equation (2)) computed using only the detected ITCs in the 10-m radius from the subject tree and the lidar-predicted DBH; DBHsumITC is the sum of the predicted DBH values of the delineated ITCs in the 10-m radius around the subject tree; CAmeanITC is the mean value of the crown areas of the delineated ITCs in the 10-m radius around the subject tree; and DsdITC is the standard deviation of the distances among the delineated ITCs in the 10-m radius around the subject tree. Among the elevation plot metrics, two percentile metrics were used (Zq20_F, and Zq95_L) and three cumulative percentage of points metrics (Zpcum1_F, Zpcum2_F, and Zpcum2_L). Six intensity plot metrics were used: Iskew_L, Iskew_F, Isd_L, Imean_F, Ipcumzq50_L, and Ipcumzq90_F.The accuracy statistics of the models obtained with the leave-one-out cross-validation are shown in Table 6.

All models experienced quite high values of MAD% (over 25%) and RMSD% (over 36%), and all had a negative bias (negative value of MD). Regarding the overfitting statistics (R2R and SSR), it can be seen that only the generic models have values below 1.1 while for the other models, these values can be higher even if (except for the one for

The results showed that no real improvement is gained in using a species-specific model with respect to a general model. It is worth noting that for the species-specific models, we had quite a low number of samples (especially for Norway spruce) and this could have influenced the results. In terms of overfitting, all models showed reasonable values of R2R and SSR; in particular, only the model for

 of Norway spruce showed values much above 1.1, which was suggested by Lipovetsky [60] as a desirable limit in order to not have overfitting.Analysis of the five ITC metrics selected indicated that they are all related to the competition indices. Some of them are clearly related, like the

 indices computed using the ITCs (CI_DBH_ITC, and CI_H_ITC), while the others are representative of a part of the competition index equations (DBHsumITC, and CAmeanITC) and of the density of the forest (DsdITC), which is related to competition. Regarding the plot metrics, it was slightly harder to find a direct relation to the competition indices. Metrics based on the distribution of Z are likely related to competition even if not directly. The Zq20_F, Zq95_L, Zpcum1_F, Zpcum2_F, and Zpcum2_L metrics describe the vertical distribution of the lidar points, and the vertical distribution of the points is related to the forest structure and density, which are related to competition. In contrast, the intensity metrics could be related to the species. As an example, Imean_F has a quite different distribution of values for the two species: It has a mean value of 23.47 (standard deviation of 3.63) for silver fir compared to 20.15 (standard deviation of 3.82) for Norway spruce.The effectiveness of lidar metrics in predicting both AGB and competition indices was also found in the study conducted by Lin et al. [43]. In particular, Lin et al. [43] showed that the height competition index estimated by lidar, especially when combined with other lidar metrics (crown radius and height) of the trees, is capable of effectively estimating above-ground carbon (AGC) at both the stand and tree level. In our case, the competition indices were used to assess the influence that high or low competition values have on biomass. The results showed that high competition values led to a decrease in biomass. Therefore, the competitive pressure of neighboring trees is probably an important factor influencing tree growth and biomass partitioning, especially for small trees. Indeed, according to Litton et al. [61] and Poorter et al. [62], biomass partitioning may vary with soil resource availability and with the ability of plants to withstand competition for light. Furthermore, according to the theory of biomass allocation, high competition may increase or reduce biomass allocation in plants [63,64]. Zhou et al. [33] found that the biomass ratio of roots and stems decreased with increasing intensity of competition from neighboring trees, while biomass at the level of branches and leaves increased.Few previous studies were found in the literature that combined lidar and competition indices. Among the ones present in the literature, the ones of Lo et al. [42], Lin et al. [43], and Ma et al. [44] are the only ones slightly related to this work. In all these studies, competition indices were computed using ITCs automatically delineated on lidar data, in a similar way to our computation of the lidar metrics CI_DBH_ITC and CI_H_ITC. None of these studies analyzed the accuracy of the prediction of competition indices using lidar metrics or validated the predictions using field data. In contrast to the present study, these studies used lidar-predicted competition indices as metrics to predict trees attributes, such as DBH, volume, and carbon density.Several studies have shown the relationship between radial growth and height growth of trees [65,66] and that the crown:height ratio may quantify competition among trees [67,68]. Therefore, the diameter and height of a tree are not only closely linked to light capture but also to the effects of water, nutrients, and soil conditions [33]. Moreover, according to the results of Zhou et al. [33], during growth, plants change how they are affected by the competition of neighboring plants, and their competitive effect on other plants. This suggests a close relationship between individual competition and tree growth.In the workflow proposed in this study, some parameters were fixed in a way that could have influenced the final results. The main one was the search radius used to compute the competition indices. Many studies in the literature focusing just on the computation of indices using field data used a different radius for each area analyzed. This is possible if all the tree crowns are measured on the ground; however, that was not our case. Moreover, as we wanted to relate the indices to the lidar data in order to have the possibility of also predicting competition indices in areas not covered by field data, we needed to have a fixed value of the search radius. We chose 10 m as it was used before in other studies investigating forests with similar characteristics [53]. It is worth noting that we also carried out the same analyses using other values, computed in other ways, but the used radius was quite close to 10 m and the final results were very similar or the same.The ITCs delineation could also have had an effect on the final results. Indeed, the higher the accuracy of the delineation, the more valuable ITC metrics are, and the more trees can be considered as subject trees in the area. The algorithm selected is a simple method when compared with the many algorithms in the literature [69], and has been used successfully in many other studies on forests with similar characteristics (e.g., [47,55]). It was effective for different forest scenarios in a previous study conducted on various forest sites in the Alps [70].Despite the high potential of lidar technology for the estimation of vegetation parameters, it must be considered that lidar also has limitations. According to Rosette et al. [71], the ability to estimate vegetation parameters (tree height and DTM) decreases in the presence of high terrain slopes and high canopy coverage. Moreover, in very dense forests, it is only able to identify dominant trees, as in our study. Values of competition indices calculated using metrics derived from lidar can be biased due to the fact that small trees are not detected.", 4. Discussion,None,4
551,"Our results showed that lidar metrics have a good capacity to predict competition indices. We developed a system that, after detecting individual tree crowns (ITCs) in the forest, on the basis of lidar metrics extracted in the neighborhood of the detected ITC, predicts two competition indices related to height and diameter at breast height (DBH). From the analyses, it emerged that the use of lidar metrics based on ITCs is important in prediction models. Moreover, we showed that all the information that can be extracted from lidar data should be used, as both plots and ITCs metrics were used in our models. Regarding the relationship between AGB and competition indices, it was observed that the AGB value decreases, increasing competition at both the DBH and height level. These results are probably related to the variation in the availability of soil-level resources and the ability of plants to withstand competition for light. The possibility of predicting competition indices in large areas opens interesting perspectives for forest management practices aimed at regulating species mixture, in particular for forests managed extensively with selective logging, typical of many mountain areas.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
552," BackgroundHistory of making fired clay-bricks in the Indian subcontinent is almost 4000 years old. Several brick structures have been excavated in the Indus Valley civilization archaeological sites where bricks were used for granaries, sewer system and other historic civic infrastructures. In most South Asia even today bricks are used as ‘building blocks’ in construction. In contrast to the reinforced concrete construction based civil engineering practices in the industrialized countries, the South Asian masonry constructed structures mostly use fired clay-bricks. A primitive brick production technology is commonly employed where heat by fuel combustion is passed through dry clay-brick cakes. Facilities where such bricks are produced are called brick kilns and they tend to be concentrated near large urban agglomerations to supply bricks for construction.The most common type of brick kiln design used in the Indo-Gangetic plains is Bull Trench Kiln (BTK). Production of bricks depends on BTK size and varies with region while the number of brick kilns themselves may correspond to the demand for the bricks. A brick kiln may use a wide variety of fuels such as coal, biomass, agricultural residue rubber tyres, and industrial byproducts [1] depending on availability of the fuel and economic incentives. For reference, an average BTK brick kiln in the Uttar Pradesh state of the Indo-Gangetic plains can produce about 4 million bricks per year by consuming 12,000 tonne soil and approximately 600 tonne coal per year (personal communication with brick operator). In other regions, production capacity varies from 2.5 million bricks per year to 8 million bricks per year [2]. This causes large emissions of PM

Even though fine aerosol concentrations are significantly higher in South Asian cities than elsewhere [4], few studies have investigated the role of brick kilns to urban air pollution.

 (66.2 Gg). Significant impact of brick kilns on urban air pollution has also been established in Dhaka [8,9,10,11], Kathmandu [12], Delhi [13,14], and few other Indian cities [1,7,15,16,17,18,19]. Not only is the brick kiln industry fuelled by demand for bricks but there also exists a nexus between rural poverty and brick kilns. Farmers may seasonally lease out their land to sell its soil during periods of unproductive agricultural activity [20] or to stave off their debts [21]. Often this leads to the farmers turning into laborers for the brick kilns [22]. Such excavation of the previously fertile agricultural top-soil for making bricks ends up having adverse implications for food security [23]. Examples of smoke emission and soil excavation are shown in Figure 1 based on the authors’ field visit to brick kiln sites in Uttar Pradesh. Exposure to smoke emitted from brick kiln also has severe effect on human health, as identified by vision and pulmonary disorders in the female site workers in Chennai [24], and emission of carcinogenic dioxins in Pakistan [25]. A recent study estimated that pollution from brick kilns ended up causing about 6100, 55,000, and 600 deaths in 2015 in Bangladesh, India, and Nepal respectively [26]. In addition to their severe environmental and human health impacts, brick kilns sites are also strongly associated with promoting modern-day slavery [27,28].Despite such multi-dimensional environmental impacts of brick kilns, there is no publicly available database of brick kiln locations or an official estimate of the number of brick kilns. It is assumed that India alone has more than 100,000 brick kilns [2]. It may be noted that the above-mentioned environmental impact studies utilized field visits, manually tagging brick kilns with satellite datasets or statistical estimation of brick kiln counts (except [28]). For example, Ref. [17] statistically determined the number of brick kilns in each Indian district by using the district population as an independent variable to predict brick kiln counts. It is possible that brick kiln locations remain unmapped due to the unregulated nature of brick kiln operations. The central pollution controlling body in India recently stated that more than 70% brick kilns were operating without consent [29], hence possibly remain unmapped. Such lack of data prevents assessing the full scale of regional environmental impacts of brick kiln operations. For example, contribution of brick kilns to urban emission and concentrations could not be included in an earlier regional air pollutant emission inventory for Asia (REAS v2, [30]) due to lack of sufficient information. The latest version of REAS v3 [31] employs statistical estimates of brick production to infer their emission. Such assumptions in the emission inventory lead to uncertainties in simulating pollutant concentrations when using chemical transport models. For example, Zhong et al. [32] found simulated elemental carbon and SO


2

 concentrations in the Kathmandu valley were underestimated compared to observations due to under-representation of brick kilns in the commonly used global emission inventories. A brick kiln location inventory is thus, beneficial for reducing emission uncertainties in South Asia and leading to accountability of their environmental impacts.The research related to mapping brick locations itself is limited and recent [33]. In high spatial resolution (<3 m) satellite imagery brick kilns can be identified through three features: brick kiln chimney, bricks pile and slabs pile [20,33]. Furthermore, in nadir orthometric view these features are laid out in a ellipsoidal shape (or a circular shape depending on the type of brick kiln). Shadow of a brick kiln’s chimney for imagery acquired at low sun elevation can be a useful visual indicator of a kiln in visible satellite bands. These features are shown in Figure 1d. Another reason that prevents identification of brick kiln through remote sensing is the prohibitive monetary cost associated with procuring high resolution imagery over a large area, specially where brick kilns are spread sparse. So far, Foody et al. [28] and Nazir et al. [34] have developed deep learning based methodology for brick kiln identification by using high resolution images available in Google Earth. However Google Earth’s high resolution imagery suffers from the drawback that its satellite imagery is infrequently and non-uniformly updated, spanning intervals of several months over megacities to several years over rural areas. This is consequential for brick kiln detection due to the semi-permanent nature of brick kiln operations. New brick kilns are built to meet the brick demand or old ones are dismantled if fine soil becomes unavailable. Brick kiln operations are dynamic, responding to demand of bricks as well as availability of fine alluvial soil.Thus a key challenge remains how can brick kiln be monitored regularly. Specifically, is it possible to use frequently updated publicly available dataset for detecting brick kilns. The objective of this study is investigate the use of Sentinel-2 imagery for detecting brick-kilns around Delhi. The originality of this paper is to demonstrate the use of open imagery for mapping brick kilns.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
553,"Sentinel-2: Surface reflectance of European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 Level 2 bands (B4: red, B3: green, B2: blue, B8: near-infrared, B11: shortwave infrared-1 and B12: shortwave infrared-2) was used. Sentinel-2 images acquired between 1 January 2018 and 1 June 2018 with cloud pixel percentage lower than 20% were cloud-masked and median-composited. The period of January to June was chosen for compositing images as brick kilns operate during these dry months. Due to the operation and preparation of fired red bricks, brick kilns visibly stand apart from the surrounding land-cover. In other months, due to seasonal suspension of operation, kilns are sometimes covered under small grass. The visible bands (red, green and blue) each have 10 m resolution making them suitable for delineating the shape of brick kilns from space and were used for object detection. The other bands (shortwave infrared-1 and shortwave infrared-2) have coarser resolution of 20 m and were used (along with visible bands and near-infrared band) for pixel classification. The images were composited over Google Earth Engine (GEE) [35] platform, where atmospheric and geometrically corrected Sentinel-2 dataset is available, and downloaded for further processing.Landsat 7, Landsat 8: Since most of the brick kilns locations were originally agricultural fields prior to their conversion to brick kiln, a time-series of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI = (nearinfrared − red/nearinfrared + red)) over brick kiln location can indicate when the agricultural field was transformed to brick kiln. Due to availability of a long time-series of USGS’s Landsat 7 imagery since 1999, they were used for estimating NDVI at brick kiln locations (further discussed in Section 3.3) after atmospheric correction and cloud-masking. To discuss the relationship of brick kilns with urban growth of built-up areas in and around Delhi, imagery from 2001 and 2017 was classified using surface reflectance from Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 respectively. These datasets were prepared over Google Earth Engine (GEE) [35] platform.Vertical construction: Digital building height (DBH) data was prepared by extracting the normalized digital surface model from publicly available Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s 30 m resolution ALOS World 3D digital surface model (AW3D30) [36]. Misra et al. [37] have already demonstrated the possibility of extracting digital building heights with a root mean square error of 6.92 m. The DBH represents the building heights for structures built upto 2010, since the AW3D30 digital surface model is a composite of the images acquired between 2005 to 2010.GIS thematic layers: Road and river network vector shapefiles were obtained from Hijmans [38] to explore drivers for the location of brick kilns.", 2.

554,"The location for this research was the region peripheral to the Delhi state in Indo-Gangetic plains of India. This region lies in the floodplains of the river Yamuna and its tributary river Hindon. The floodplains are covered with rich alluvial top soil. The land-use of the peri-urban area varies from sub-urban to rural settlement and agricultural lands. The last two decades have seen rapid construction activity in the region surrounding Delhi and its satellite cities. This makes it a suitable region for setting up of brick kilns due to abundance of raw material (fine top soil) and close proximity to the market (building construction sites). Additionally this region experiences severe air pollution episodes during the dry winter season coinciding with the period of brick kiln operations. Fine particulate matter (PM

555,"Deep learning based object detection approaches have risen in popularity due to significantly better performance than conventional approaches such as hierarchical segmentation or multi-resolution segmentation. However deep learning methods require huge training dataset to learn weights and biases for the artificial neurons. Concurrently, lack of a sufficient annotated training data is a common concern for application of deep learning based object detection to remote sensing. Transfer learning is a promising approach for those applications which are constrained by small training dataset. Transfer learning facilitates application of weights learned on a general domain dataset to be fine-tuned for a specific domain dataset. Domain adaptation involves two steps, (1) freezing the layers of a pre-trained model (trained on a general domain) and adding new trainable layers on top of the frozen layers and training them over the target domain dataset; (2) partially unfreezing the higher layers and fine-tuning the unfrozen layers by training them at a very low learning rate. Here freezing a layer refers to not updating the layer parameters while training. Imagenet [40] is a repository of over 14 million natural color images with more than 20,000 human labeled categories. Several convolutional neural network architectures pre-trained on the Imagenet are available such as VGG-16 [41], ResNet-50 [42] and others. Due to the ability of transferring weights learned from a general repository like Imagenet, transfer learning is becoming popular within remote sensing space for object detection tasks such as ship detection in synthetic aperture radar imagery [43,44], airplane detection in very high resolution imagery [45] and slum detection in medium resolution imagery [46,47].Training data preparation: For the present study, first the training dataset was prepared over which transfer learning was performed. Brick kilns locations were identified visually with Google Earth Pro desktop software, to prepare an inventory of the locations. Unaided identification of brick kilns in the Sentinel-2 imagery is difficult due to the relative coarse pixel size with respect to the size of the kilns. Care was taken to ensure that a co-located brick kiln is humanly identifiable in both the Google Earth as well as the Sentinel-2 image. For example, as can be seen in Figure 3b, a single brick kiln can have 4 to 10 Sentinel-2 pixels along its one dimension. Brick kiln dimensions also vary at different locations. After determining the locations of the brick kilns, 200 64 × 64 pixel-sized RGB (natural color composite) training patches from Sentinel-2 were extracted for each of the 4 classes—brick kilns, fallow land, built-up and vegetation. 80 additional patches for each class were prepared for validation and testing. The patches were selected in the RGB bands for transfer learning as these bands have the highest resolution among other Sentinel-2 bands and because the existing models are pre-trained on the Imagenet which only has RGB images. Band reflectance of the patches was scaled from 0 to 1 using a ‘min-max’ scaler. Mean of 1 and 99 percentile reflectance of the brick kiln patches was used for scaling the respective bands (red: 0.227 to 0.074 sr

) of the training dataset. Examples of scaled patches for the 4 classes are shown in Figure 4. To enhance training sample size data and prevent overfitting, an augmentation procedure was performed randomly on 40% training patches. Data augmentation included following transformations: translation, rotation by 50o and vertical and horizontal flipping.Transfer learning and prediction: Keras Python library [48] with Tensorflow [49] backend was used for transfer learning. VGG-16 network was used due to the ease of training the model (due to less number of hyperparameters) and early convergence of training. VGG-16 has 16 layers in total, 12 convolutional layers with 3 × 3 kernel-sized filters and 4 four fully-connected layers. VGG-16 weights pre-trained on the Imagenet dataset is also available as part of the Keras package. The network takes in a 224 × 224 RGB patch as input and outputs the probability of that patch belonging to each of the 1000 classes on which the VGG-16 network was trained. Transfer learning of brick kilns patches using the pre-trained VGG-16 network was performed in the two steps mentioned earlier: adding layers to VGG-16 and training added layers, and fine-tuning the network. Firstly, the output layer of the VGG-16 network was replaced by two successive fully connected layers with the penultimate layer having 512 nodes with a ReLU (rectified linear) activation and the final layer having 4 nodes with a ‘softmax’ activation. The 4 nodes of the final layer output the classification probability of the target 4 classes (that is, brick kiln, fallow-land, built-up, and vegetation). The modified architecture is shown in the Table S1. The weights and bias of the fully connected layers were trained for 300 epochs with a batch size of 64 with the ‘Adam’ (Adaptive Moment Estimation) optimizer using a moderate learning rate (0.001) and ‘categorical cross entropy’ loss function. The goal of the optimizer is to minimize the loss function. Categorical cross entropy loss is used for multi-class classification tasks. Secondly, fine tuning was performed wherein the initial 12 convolutional layers were frozen. Unfreezing more initial layers always runs the risk of overfitting. This is because the initial layers learn general features (such as edges or lines) while the layers near the output learn features specialized for the target domain. The weights of the unfrozen layers were fine-tuned for 1000 epochs with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer using a smaller learning rate (0.0001) with momentum (0.9) and a ‘categorical cross entropy’ loss function. Providing a momentum prevents the SGD optimizer from getting stuck in local minima despite a low learning rate. Finally, by giving a RGB patch as an input, this network outputs the probabilities of that patch belonging to each of the classes, brick kiln, fallow-land, built-up, and vegetation.As VGG-16 itself is not a localization algorithm, brick kiln location within the patch was further identified using a sliding-windows approach. The 64 × 64 pixel sized patch window was slid with a 75% overlap with its neighbors in each directions. Thus any given patch partially overlapped with 15 other patches (excluding itself). In presence of a ground truth brick kiln, all the partially overlapping patches containing that brick kiln must identify the brick kiln with the highest probability. Consequently when at least 5 partially overlapping patches detected brick kiln with the highest probability, the overlapping region was assigned to contain a brick kiln.", 2. Methodology, 2.3. Transfer Learning Based Object Identification,2
556,"Although deep learning methods are quite adept at object identification, the relative coarse resolution of Sentinel-2 imagery with respect to the brick kiln features (such as chimney or presence of bricks) gives rise to several false positive identification. False positives occur due to those land-use objects which share geometric features similar to brick kilns in coarse resolution imagery such as red rooftops of round-shaped buildings or playgrounds. To remove such false positive detections, pixel-wise spectral classification was performed for the same target area using random forest classification. Random forest algorithm was chosen as it is non-parametric, not prone to over-fitting and good at dealing with any outliers in training data [50]. Sentinel-2 bands (red, green, blue, near-infrared, shortwave infrared-1, and shortwave infrared-2) and derived NDVI was used for random forest based classification (with 100 decision trees) to the class brick kiln soil, fallow-land, built-up, vegetation and water.If a region that was proposed by the transfer learning algorithm as containing a brick kiln also contained at least 5 pixels classified as brick kilns by random forest classifier, then that region was accepted as the brick kiln location. Regions of brick kiln locations overlapping more than 70% were removed during post-processing through ‘faster non-max suppression’ algorithm [51].", 2. Methodology, 2.4. Random Forest Based Pixel Classification,2
557,"Initial transfer learning was able to achieve a training and validation accuracy as 65.42% and 66.33%, and the categorical cross entropy loss as 0.84 and 0.86. After fine tuning, there was further improvement to training and validation accuracy as 85.12% and 86.67%, and the categorical cross entropy loss as 0.36 and 0.52. The fine tuning learning is shown in Figure 5. This was further enhanced by taking intersections of the identified regions with the spectrally classified pixels. Figure 6 shows the brick kilns identified by the current methodology in the north-eastern portion of Delhi. It can also be seen that patches of bare-land are located near brick kilns. These patches are used for drying molded clay bricks before firing them in the kilns. The final confusion matrix is shown in Table 1. Precision (true positive/(true positive + false positive)) and Recall (true positive/(true positive + false negative)) of brick kiln detections in the north-eastern portion of the study domain was 0.99 and 0.72 respectively. This signifies that underestimation of brick kiln counts by about 28%. In all 1564 brick kilns were detected around Delhi. If we account for 28% underestimation, the true count of brick kilns would be about 2172 brick kilns.The overall F1 score (2 × (Recall × Precision)/(Recall + Precision)) of our hybrid object detection and pixel classification approach is 0.83. This score is considerably lower than that obtained by using very high resolution imagery. For example using Google Earth imagery for brick kiln detection Nazir et al. [34] and Foody et al. [28] obtained F1 score of 1 and 0.94 respectively. Possible reasons for a lower F1 score for detections using a coarser resolution Sentinel-2 imagery were explored. Brick kilns operate in the dry season from November to July as mentioned earlier. Brick kilns are detected with high accuracy if the kilns are surrounded by vegetation or soil such that the geometric shape of the kiln is discernible. However accuracy of the detection is low when the soil is spectrally similar to the brick kilns. This is true for kilns operating in arid soils lacking any vegetation such that the kilns are not discernable to the object detection algorithm. An example of one such false negative is shown in Figure 7 where the brick kilns could not be identified in the Sentinel-2 imagery. On the other hand, some temporarily inactive brick kilns had grass growing on them, leading to difference in spectral properties compared to other active brick kilns and causing their pixels not being classified as brick kilns. Brick kilns that were located completely adjacent to each other in the ground truth, were not detected as it was impossible to segregate or identify them as two distinct brick kilns in the Sentinel-2 imagery. Our count of 1564 kilns (as shown in Figure 8a) is almost 1.5 times the number of brick kilns discussed earlier by Guttikunda and Calori [13] over the same area in 2013. Although their data collection was performed 5 years prior to the Sentinel-2 data used in the present study, several brick kilns locations in the south-western portion of the study domain (around the city of Gurgaon as shown in Figure 8c) were missed by their manual tagging approach. This suggests that the calculated contribution of brick kiln emission to Delhi’s urban air pollution (PM



2.5


) was underestimated by the authors of [13].", 3. Result and Discussion, 3.1. Brick Kiln Identification,3
558,"Brick kilns around Delhi are located in clusters situated between urban agglomeration of satellite towns (Figure 8a). The brick kilns are located along the flood-plains (river Yamuna) and along secondary roads (Figure 8b). Flood-plains provide access to the raw materials such as fine alluvial clayey soil and water, for producing bricks. Network of secondary roads is used for transporting bricks, possibly due to the current guideline of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) that bars brick kilns from being located next to highways. Construction of buildings requires bricks, and brick kilns are located close to wherever dense horizontal expansion has taken place (Figure 8c). Brick kilns exist at the built-up edge of city or in the rural-urban zone where urban growth is taking place. Similarly, brick kilns are also located less than 10 km from multi-storey residential buildings (Figure 8d).", 3. Result and Discussion, 3.2. Drivers of Brick Kiln Locations,3
559,"Based on field surveys, it was noticed that active brick kiln sites were covered with soil and red dust whereas abandoned brick kilns were covered under vegetation of grass and shrubs. This can provide additional information about a brick-kiln’s operational status from satellite. Figure 9 shows an abandoned brick kiln and newly constructed brick kilns between 2006 and 2018 in northern Delhi. Time series of NDVI, an index of vegetation greenness, was calculated using cloud-free Landsat 7 imagery over brick kilns to determine their period of activity. NDVI varies between −1 to 1, with agricultural vegetation showing NDVI higher than 0.4 while sparse vegetation has NDVI between 0.2 to 0.4. NDVI of bare soil is lower than 0.2. NDVI over sample brick kiln locations are shown in Figure 10. An agriculture land is identifiable by its crop calendar of seasonal planting and harvesting of the crops. This is reflected as periodic variation of NDVI values. On the other hand if a low NDVI persists for a duration longer than the usual crop calendar, then that suggests the onset of brick kiln construction at that location. Figure 10a shows NDVI over a brick kiln whose operations have continued since prior to 1999 until present. Figure 10b shows NDVI over a crop field that was converted to brick kiln in 2008. Some brick kilns were also abandoned as shown by Figure 10c, where the location was undergoing agricultural activity until 2008, followed by brick kiln construction and then possible abandonment in 2017. The sharp increase of NDVI post 2017 suggests that brick kiln operation was suspended at that location.", 3. Result and Discussion, 3.3. Age of Brick Kiln Operations,3
560,"Future directions involve preparing a comprehensive regional dataset of brick kiln locations as well as their operational characteristics. Our methodology demonstrates the utility of publicly available Sentinel-2 imagery for brick kiln detection. This shall be further useful for mapping brick kilns over the whole South Asian region. Such a dataset would be useful for assessing drivers and impacts of brick kiln in different cities. As demonstrated in this paper, sudden and persisting shift in NDVI could indicate the duration of brick kiln operation. This could be further employed for assessing the net historical coal consumption and emission of trace gases from each brick kiln. However brick kilns do not operate all year round and not all brick kiln start or stop their operations at the same time. To accurately assess the contribution of brick kiln emission to air quality, exact operation months are needed. Such brick kiln dynamics cannot be inferred from NDVI trends. Availability of high spatio-temporal resolution imagery, for example Planet’s daily 3 m spatial resolution imagery, can help in identifying the operation duration each year by tracking presence or absence of molded clay bricks outside the brick kiln (shown in Figure S1). Such an information will be useful for inferring activity status of individual brick kilns. Recent guidelines from India’s CPCB have instructed kiln operators to upgrade to the relatively less polluting ‘zig-zag’ type brick kilns, having a rectangular shape and a taller chimney stack height for better dispersal of pollutant plume. The methodology proposed in the present work cannot distinguish between kiln types due to the limited resolution of the Sentinel-2 imagery. However changes in time series of surface backscatter from synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery, such as Sentinel-1, over the brick kiln locations may be used for inferring whether any upgradation of the brick kilns took place. Thus, information of brick kiln location identified in Sentinel-2 optical imagery can be combined with their SAR backscatter to assess which operators are complying with emission guidelines.", 3. Result and Discussion, 3.4. Future Work,3
561,"Brick kilns are known to be major emitters of black carbon, sulfur dioxide and other fine particulate matter, yet their spatial distribution remains largely unknown. We successfully demonstrated the first use of publicly available dataset, Sentinel 2, with deep learning methodology to detect brick kiln locations on a large spatial scale with a recall of 0.72, precision of 0.99 and F1 score of 0.83. 1564 brick kilns were detected around Delhi, higher than previously reported. Brick-kilns lie at urban-rural interface and are usually less than 10 km away from urban boundaries. The location of brick kiln is dependent on resource availability, such as fine clay from river-beds and access to road network. Brick kiln clusters were located near urban areas with tall buildings or areas where outward urban expansion has take place in last 16 years. Brick kilns are non-permanent structures whose duration of operation were estimated by a time-series of NDVI values over their location. As several current emission inventories under-represent the contribution of brick kilns to air pollution in South Asian cities, this dataset and methodology will be useful to adequately reveal their impact on air quality.", 4. Conclusions,None,4
562,"Tropical forests are often located in remote and difficult-to-access areas. Therefore, field data collection costs are high, which forces compromises in the measurements collected or the number of locations sampled. As a consequence, high-quality forest structure information is difficult and expensive to obtain by traditional ground surveys in these areas. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) data have been widely used to produce structural parameter estimates of both temperate and tropical forests and to monitor native and commercial forests [1,2,3,4,5].This technology provides a quick and complete assessment of forest structure, which allows the calculation of metrics such as canopy height, wood volume, biomass, and carbon stocks [4,6]. In addition, LiDAR also has multiple applications in the planning and monitoring of activities related to forest management through the assessment of digital elevation and surface models with sub-meter accuracy [7,8,9,10,11], enabling surveying of areas difficult to access at relatively low cost. Forest monitoring, particularly of areas undergoing forest management, require repeat LiDAR estimates of damages produced by logging, changes in the canopy cover [12], and biomass stock dynamics [5,13]. The benefits for scientists and forest companies of LiDAR data are immense. However, despite the great usefulness of this technology, its acquisition is still expensive [14] and limited to large, contiguous areas. Challenges in obtaining data are considerable for regions that are furthest away from population centers where the companies providing these services are usually located (e.g., [7]), which limits the use of LiDAR surveys—notably those that require repeated flights over the same area or that do not have large budgets for data acquisition.In the last few years, we have observed an increase in the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for forest use [15,16,17] and as a complementary tool to aircraft-borne LiDAR for forest studies [18]. For example, UAV-borne visual sensors have provided 3D products through photogrammetric analyses and high-resolution orthomosaics, creating a revolution in landscape mapping through its combined low-cost hardware and high-resolution outputs [17,19,20]. This approach is limited, however, to mapping areas visible from multiple perspectives, and as such, visibility is typically unable to penetrate most forest canopies to the ground and therefore has significantly limited products [19,21]; for example, it is unable to produce digital elevation models, which require ground points, and therefore tree height models—which are critical for most studies of aboveground biomass. In the search for alternatives, LiDAR sensors have very recently become sufficiently small to be mounted on UAVs and have been used to generate models similar to those produced by standard aircraft-borne LiDAR systems, substantially extending the usefulness of UAVs [21,22,23,24]. UAV-borne LiDAR—which usually employs a flight above ground level (AGL), below 100 m, at a low (10–40 km/h) speed, with wider scanning angles, and high pulse frequency—are capable of producing very high-density point clouds, which largely exceed the ones produced by aircraft-borne LiDAR. The development of allometric models to estimate aboveground dry biomass stored in dominant and co-dominant individual trees in tropical forests is feasible with the typical 5–10 pts/m2 LiDAR data obtained from aircraft-borne LiDAR sensors [25]. However, the much higher point-density clouds produced by UAV-borne LiDAR enable more extensive and varied uses, including assessing interior forest structure with higher precision and accuracy [21,26], digital terrain model with very high resolution [27], direct diameter-at-breast height (DBH) estimates [24], and individual tree detection and detailed crown segmentation [28].The objective of this study was to compare LiDAR data and its products obtained from two different platforms: aircraft and UAV. Specifically, we compared: (a) LiDAR point clouds and metrics; (b) digital terrain, surface and canopy models, and (c) aboveground biomass (AGB) models for a group of forest inventory plots located in an Amazonian tropical forest in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve in Acre, Brazil.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
563,"Seringal Filipinas is a small rural community located in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve (locally known as Resex Chico Mendes), which is an International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) category VI Protected Area with sustainable use of natural resources, located about 30 km from Brasileia city (Figure 1). The community has little structure for agricultural production and storage, and the primary economic income is from non-timber product extraction. The forest is predominantly open with a transition to a dense forest with a relatively high occurrence of the species Hevea brasiliensis L. and Bertholletia excelsa Bonpl. The climate is classified as Awi (Köppen) with annual precipitation of around 2000 mm and an average temperature of 24 °C, with a dry season between the months of June and September. The area has gentle topography with a maximum elevation range of around 75 m. Because it is contained in an extractive reserve, the forest is typically well conserved with only small areas of secondary forest, pasture, and crops, not exceeding 5% of the total area. However, there have been indications of increased deforestation and selective logging in this area in the last decade [29,30].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Site,2
564,"A forest inventory was conducted in March 2017. During the inventory, 10 randomly distributed 1 ha (100 × 100 m) permanent sample plots (PSP) were established. The plot boundaries were defined using a handheld compass for azimuths and a measuring tape for length. GPS coordinates of all plot corners were calculated using a differentially corrected GPS with at least 30 minutes of acquisition per point. All woody stems greater than 10 cm in diameter at breast height (DBH) were labeled, measured, and identified. For each tree, oven-dried AGB was estimated with Equation (1), which was developed for a similar forest in the southern Amazon [31]. Ground measurement data were summarized to the plot level for further analysis (Table 1).

565,"Aircraft-borne LiDAR: Discrete return LiDAR data were collected in September 2015 using a Trimble Harrier 68i sensor set to 300 kHz, installed in a Cessna 206 aircraft, flying at 600 m above ground level (AGL) with an average speed of 198 km/h. This system employs full-waveform digitization, and each waveform is then analyzed by Trimble software to identify return peaks, allowing for a theoretically unlimited number of discrete returns per waveform, but typically 3–6. In our landscape dataset (which covers all PSPs), we identified a maximum of 6 returns being present. LiDAR sidelap was 50%, resulting in a point cloud with a minimum (average) density of 5 (14) pts m−2, covering an area of 1000 ha (Table 2). Estimated point absolute spatial accuracy is < 0.25 m horizontal and < 0.15 m vertical (Trimble provided specifications sheet). UAV-borne LiDAR: Discrete dual return (strongest and last) LiDAR data was collected in August 2017 using the GatorEye Unmanned Flying Laboratory (www.GatorEye.org). The complete sensor suite includes radiometric thermal, high-resolution visual, dual hyperspectral sensors, and LiDAR. The flight platform is a DJI Matrice 600 Pro hexacopter capable of vertical takeoff and landing, with 16 minute flight autonomy for smaller areas and a five km telemetry/control range. In this study, we used only data from the LiDAR sensor. The GatorEye Generation 1 used in this study (the system is now on Gen 3 with a higher-power LiDAR sensor) features a Phoenix Scout integration, including a Velodyne VLP-16 puck lite sensor with dual returns, capable of 600,000 returns per second (Table 2). The system has an L1/L2 dual-frequency Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receiver, and the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is a tactical grade STIM 300. UAV trajectories are obtained through post-process fusion of the IMU and GNSS data in Novatel Inertial Explorer software, differentially corrected to a mobile base station (X900-OPUS) set within 500 m of each launch location. The location of the base station itself was determined using the online Trimble CenterPoint RTX post-processing website. GatorEye flights were conducted at 60 m AGL and an average speed of 30 km/h. LiDAR sidelap was approximately 90%. Point absolute spatial accuracy has been estimated to be <5 cm [32].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. LiDAR Data Acquisition,2
566,"The FUSION LiDAR processing package [33] was used for processing the LiDAR all-returns data (first, intermediates, and last returns per pulse) for both GatorEye and aircraft data. LiDAR returns that occurred within each of the ten ground plot polygons were extracted from the acquisition datasets to create an all-returns point cloud file for each plot (Appendix 1). The ground surface elevation (interpolated from the LiDAR digital terrain model) was then subtracted from each return to remove topographic variation within the plot. Descriptive statistics of the LiDAR point cloud vertical structure, using all returns above 1 m, were computed for each plot. The one-meter minimum height above ground was used to reduce noise within the near-ground point cloud caused by low vegetation and imperfections in the ground point filtering. First, the following layers were produced at a 1 × 1 m spatial resolution: (1) a reference image which serves as a background image for data exploration and display, and which provides sufficient resolution to clearly recognize overstory tree crowns as well as areas of agricultural crops and pastures; (2) digital terrain (DTM) (e.g., elevation-ground), surface (DSM) (top-of-canopy), and canopy height (CHM) models (CHM = DSM − DTM). Second, we computed a suite of forest structural metrics at different spatial resolutions. A list of all computed metrics is provided in Table 3, and a detailed description of each metric is provided in [33]. In overview, the metrics provide information on the vertical distribution of LiDAR points across the forest profile and the shape and heterogeneity of this distribution.For canopy cover metrics, we used a canopy overstory threshold height of 2 m. Plot-level LiDAR metrics were merged with the summarized field plot data for regression modeling. Raster layers of forest canopy metrics were created using FUSION, following the same methodology used by [7]. All rasters produced were automatically aligned [34]. We then created from the LiDAR point clouds, at a 100 × 100 m resolution, raster layers for the forest structure metrics selected as predictor variables to the AGB models at a raster cell resolution equal to the nominal ground plot size over the entire 1000 ha study area.", 2.

The PROC MIXED (SAS 9.2) procedure was used to test the equivalency of slopes for the adjusted equations between the predicted values.

The variance inflation factor (VIF) statistics and a Pearson correlation test were used to eliminate highly collinear predictor variables [35,36]. If VIF exceeded 5.0 or ρ above 0.7 for a candidate predictor variable, it was dropped from the regression model.

569,"The GatorEye produced about 35 times greater density point clouds than the aircraft system, averaging 381.2 ± 58.2 returns m−2 versus 11.0 ± 1.8 returns m−2, respectively (Table 4, Figure 2A,B). Although in much greater number, the GatorEye LiDAR sensor produces only two returns per pulse (Table 4, Figure 2D), while the aircraft one multiple (4–6 per pulse, Table 4, Figure 2C). The points density profile of the returns reflects the studied area canopy structure with a peak of return numbers around 22 m for both cases. Looking to the point distribution percentage height profile, we observed a higher proportion of aircraft returns below 20 m height produced by the larger LiDAR footprint and the higher number of returns per pulse (Figure 2D). The GatorEye’s higher point cloud number and density resulted in its point clouds producing visibly higher resolution delineation of tree branches and leaf area distribution (Figure 3). The GatorEye’s filtered ground points remained about 1.5 times greater than the aircraft system, with point densities averaging 0.42 ± 0.09 and 0.29 ± 0.09 returns m−2, respectively (Table 4).", 3.

The metrics for the height mode and 95th percentile height above ground for aircraft-borne LiDAR provided the most parsimonious multivariate model (Adj. R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 19.3 Mg·ha−1). For the GatorEye, the best fit was obtained with the 90th percentile height above ground (Adj. R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 24.8 Mg·ha−1).

As, during this time, only limited natural changes in the forest canopy occurred, we were able to robustly compare vegetation metrics and models produced by the two systems, similar to as if they had happened synchronously [37].The GatorEye sensor pulse frequency was only twice the Harrier 68i Trimble, but, in part due to having 16 lasers versus the one used in the Harrier system, it produced a point cloud almost 35 times denser. The main differences between the point clouds generated by these sensors were due to the GatorEye lower flight height and speed (60 m AGL at 12 m/s) when compared with the aircraft (600 m at 55 m/s), and due to the number of lasers. Low-altitude flight at relatively slow speeds can produce point densities much higher than traditional aircraft LiDAR approaches [38]. The dense point cloud generated by GatorEye in this study was similar to or higher than that of other UAV-borne LiDAR systems [28,39], which allowed the identification of individual tree and branch structure with results similar, in the overstory, to terrestrial laser scanners. That allows a broader use of these data for applications such as individual canopy tree detection, stem segmentation, tree height, and estimation of understory leaf area index [21,24]. The differences in point cloud density were possibly responsible for the main differences observed among the extracted LiDAR metrics. Even when the density of the points is not as high as in this study, they can significantly improve CHM-based metrics derived from vegetation in both temperate and tropical forests [40].Some UAV-borne LiDAR sensors are capable of producing multi-return per pulse (e.g., RIEGL VUX series); however, the GatorEye’s Velodyne VLP-16 sensor returns the strongest and last returns. When we compared the ground-filtered clouds of both sensors, we observed that even when flying at a higher altitude and speed, the Harrier 68i was capable of producing up to five useful returns per pulse. The second and particularly third pulse echoes mostly exist beneath trees [22]; thus analyzing the Harrier 68i ground filtered point cloud, we observe more second and third returns than first. The cloud density of the ground returns of the GatorEye’s cloud was still higher than that from the aircraft system but had a higher standard deviation in the number of ground returns per area, indicating the GatorEye ground points were not as uniformly distributed across the ground as the returns produced by the aircraft system. We attribute this difference to the GatorEye acquiring very dense point in areas of lower leaf area index (LAI), with more limited returns in areas of dense coverage, while the aircraft-system more fully penetrated across the entire forest floor.The differences highlighted above did not affect the correlation of the high-resolution (1 × 1 m) digital terrain models (DTM) produced by both systems within the PSPs. Typically, at high resolutions, the relatively low-density point clouds of both systems would force estimation of ground location and forest structure through statistical interpolation approaches [14]. However, we found an almost total agreement between the DTMs from both systems, indicating that the ground returns from both systems were sufficient to fully and accurately represent the forest ground surface—a critical aspect for post-process work such as AGB calculation. Different from the DTM, although highly correlated, the much higher GatorEye point cloud density, and the time interval between the flights, did produce some noticeable differences between the DSM and CHM models. Changes observed in the forest structure, through natural tree falls and growth canopy trees as well as within previously existing gap areas in the PSP, produced height differences. Thus, some negative height differences (CHM 2017–CHM2015) can be attributed to tree- and branch-fall gap creation and positive height differences made by pioneer species rapidly growing in the previously existing forest gaps. However, due to the large dispersion observed between CHM models, other factors such as i. crown delineation inconsistencies created by individual tree growth or absence of returns to computed tree height in a cell (in particular for the lower density aircraft data); ii. differences in flight and LiDAR sensors specifications (e.g., with a much higher number of returns per area, the GatorEye data resulted in a higher number of heights in the cells, generating a better chance to identify the highest part of the treetop); iii. phenological phases differences (e.g., flowering or leaves fall); and iv. crown movement by wind [14] also contributed to the observed differences between models.The AGB model produced by the aircraft system presented a higher R2 value and lower RMSE. In similar studies, despite technical differences in the LiDAR data acquisition, the AGB models produced by UAV-borne LiDAR (e.g., [41]) had similar accuracy to those produced by aircraft systems (e.g., [8,12]). Other factors, such as the quality of fieldwork on the establishment, measurement, and geolocation of the ground plots, also can strongly affect the accuracy of the models. Still, in this study, the models were developed from the same PSP data and geolocation. All AGB models produced presented high accuracy, and the uncertainty at 1 ha resolution was lower or comparable with values previously reported in other tropical forests for both aircraft and UAV-based LiDAR systems [5,13,41]. The inclusion of more LiDAR independent variables produced models with higher R2 statistics. The use of more than two independent variables to compose a LiDAR AGB model is considered acceptable (e.g., [42]); however, to avoid highly collinear LiDAR metrics that would limit the model’s predictive usefulness over the range of forest structure condition in the study site [7], we only accepted models with VIF below 5 and Pearson correlation test below 0.7. In our study, the best model to the aircraft was a combination of two LiDAR metrics representing the forest higher stratum (Elev P95) and the elevation mode (Elev mode) [43] and to GatorEye an univariate model based only in the 90th percentile above ground height. Correlation coefficients above 0.8 are not typical in tropical forests, but we found a study [37] where, in similar conditions, the authors found a very high accuracy in a model built with three independent variables. In our study, we built models for both GatorEye and Aircraft with Adj. R2 > 0.9 with acceptable VIF (below 5), but we discarded these models because they present Pearson correlation > 0.7.The AGB models produced by both systems were highly correlated; however, there was no 1:1 statistical correspondence. Therefore, both systems proved to be equally efficient for estimating ABG, but the models of both systems were not statistically equal. Although the average biomass estimated at the landscape scale was very similar, the reduced statistical correspondence was likely due to the canopy structure changing during the two-year difference between LiDAR data collections. We believe that studies using data collected in the same period may achieve the statistical correspondence match between the models from the two systems.One current use of the AGB models produced by LiDAR is through the use of satellite images to upscale AGB estimates to a regional scale. Usually, when large LiDAR samples are available, a first upscale is performed from the field plot scale to LiDAR sampled area [44,45]. Here, we tested the possibility to upscale the AGB model produced by GatorEye. AGB LiDAR models can be, when functioning correctly, generalized [46] or applied in different regions [42]. In our extrapolation of both models to the entire area covered by the 2015 LiDAR flight, the AGB maps produced presented a surprisingly high correlation, as both models used the same LiDAR metrics as independent variables, and these metrics were unaffected by the difference in cloud point density (see Figure 3). When the same procedure was performed with the GatorEye univariate regression model, although the model correlation was still high, there was a tendency for the model to slightly underestimate AGB values.", 4. Discussion,None,4
575,"The aircraft and GatorEye systems produced highly correlated LiDAR products, including DTMs, DSMs and CHMs, forest structural metrics, and AGB models. In general, the main differences were a result of the GatorEye providing a much higher point cloud density, resulting from a lower and slower flight pattern with a higher return per time period and a complete 360-degree horizontal and 30-degrees vertical scan angle field-of-view (FOV) sensor incorporating 16x the number of lasers. A small number of natural disturbances that occurred during the two years between flights was visible by comparing the DSMs. Ground returns of the GatorEye were still higher but less so than the overall point cloud due to the aircraft system’s multiple returns. The LiDAR AGB models produced by both systems presented similar accuracy and AGB estimation at the plot level, as well as when upscaled across the entire 1000 ha landscape scale flown by the aircraft system in 2015. Our results highlight the advantages of and recommend the use of UAV-borne LiDAR sensors as an effective approach for monitoring forest AGB stock dynamics in areas where previously only aircraft-borne LiDAR could be considered. We also highlight new possibilities feasible with these uniquely high-density point clouds, including multi-temporal 3D monitoring and analyses of detailed crown structure and interior forest leaf area density distribution, which can be indicators of forest structure and AGB stocks and dynamics.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
576,"The signature of the Kyoto Protocol has renewed interest in the study of forests. Forests act as potential carbon sinks for the mitigation of climate change impacts, but in turn, they are also affected by climate. Specifically, Mediterranean forests are very sensitive to climate change effects. According to [1], an increment of annual mean air temperature of 3–4 °C and a reduction of annual precipitation of 20% would lead to a decrease in photosynthesis and a decline of biomass accumulation during the current century. In this context, the net primary production (NPP) of terrestrial ecosystems is a variable that can reflect these changes, and its monitoring becomes key to apply the needed adaptation and mitigation actions. NPP is a function of gross primary production (GPP), the flux of carbon fixed by plants through photosynthesis, minus plant autotrophic respiration (RA), the flux of carbon released back to atmosphere due to internal plant metabolism. Therefore, NPP quantifies the flux of carbon stored by plants in their structure.Three main methods used for the estimation of vegetation carbon fluxes and storage are (1) field measurements, (2) remote sensing, and (3) bio-geochemical modeling, which are all briefly described below.(1) Field measurements are the most accurate and are usually considered as the reference. The eddy covariance (EC) technique allows the estimation of net ecosystem carbon exchange (defined as NPP minus heterotrophic respiration) and total respiration from spectral and micrometeorological continuous measurements [2]. However, it is a site-specific method that only accounts for several hundreds of squared meters around the measurement site. For its best functioning, the required local conditions include flat upwind terrain and lack of horizontal air mass movements. Thus, it is not particularly useful for the study of spatial patterns. Forest inventories (both at regional and national scales) provide periodic estimates of forest attributes such as volume and biomass [3], from which carbon storage can be estimated and categorized by forest type, species, and for different administrative units (e.g., province, region, and state). This methodology can be applied at large scales, but it is expensive to implement in terms of invested resources and time [4]. For example, in the particular case of the study area (peninsular Spain, see Section 3), only one national inventory is performed every 10 years [5].(2) Remote sensing data derived from measurements of radiation reflected or emitted by the Earth’s surface, which are available over extensive areas, allow carbon fluxes and storage to be estimated [6,7]. Several efforts to estimate GPP have recently been made in the study area [8,9,10] using the Monteith approach [11], but the estimation of NPP is more problematic due to the difficulty in the estimation of RA [12,13]. Optical data for the estimation of carbon storage are available at a suitable frequency and globally, but they suffer from saturation of the signal and the conditions of the atmosphere [4]. Radar data are not affected by atmospheric conditions but also suffer from signal saturation, and the complex processing needed for their use is problematic in topographically rugged areas [14].(3) Bio-geochemical models such as Biome-BGC [15,16] can simulate vegetation processes (including carbon fluxes and storage) and have been recently applied in Mediterranean regions with success [17,18,19]. These models, however, require a large amount of input data, which can be classified into ecophysiological parameters and drivers (site physical data and meteorological time series). Moreover, Biome-BGC assumes that the considered ecosystem is in equilibrium with its surroundings, and its outputs must be corrected to account for actual ecosystem conditions. Such correction can be carried out by the use of growing stock volume (GSV) [20], which is the volume over bark of all living trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) ≥ 75 mm [21].Previous studies have produced the data needed to use bio-geochemical models in the study area despite the difficulty of obtaining them at a spatially distributed level. The methodology for the production of the principal daily meteorological series (minimum and maximum air temperature, precipitation, and incoming solar radiation) by means of ordinary kriging and artificial neural networks (ANN) was developed in [22,23]. Uncertainties of 0.93 °C, 1.94 mm, and 3.16 MJ m-2 d-1 were respectively obtained for air temperature, precipitation, and incoming solar radiation. Other required meteorological daily series (day length, daylight air temperature, humidity) can be obtained through the use of microclimate simulation models, such as MT-CLIM [24]. Ecophysiological parameters for the main vegetation types in Mediterranean areas were set by [17] taking into account the typical water stress effect. Soil texture maps (with standard deviation generally below 4%, although it can rise to ~100% in mountainous terrain) [25], land cover maps (with geometrical error ≤ 3 m) [26], and digital elevation models [27] are also available for the study area. A rooting depth map was obtained as a result of a calibration of Biome-BGC in the study area [19]. The rooting depth is the depth at which plants are able to grow roots [15] and is a crucial input in Biome-BGC for the simulation of the site water balance. A GSV map with RMSE = 64 m3 ha-1 was produced for the study area from a combination of remote sensing and forest inventory data [28].Following the previous research efforts described above, and based on the capacity of NPP to track the changes in vegetation due to the climate change, the objectives of the present study were: (1) to apply a modeling strategy to assess forest annual NPP at the peninsular Spain scale using remote sensing and ancillary data and (2) to simulate forest annual NPP in future climate conditions (increases in air temperature and reductions in precipitation). The modeling strategy consisted of the combination of remote sensing and bio-geochemical modeling (Monteith approach and Biome-BGC) driven by information layers currently available over peninsular Spain and mostly derived from remote sensing data. It was applied to the five main forest ecosystems in the study area and validated against forest inventory observations. The simulation of future NPP was based on Biome-BGC simulations using meteorological time series modified on the basis of future climate scenarios.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
577,"To assess forest NPP, a modeling strategy (schematically summarized in Figure 1) that combines two models was applied (for the description of the data involved in the calculation of the different variables, see Section 3.3). The first model was a Monteith-like production efficiency model optimized for the study area [8], which was used to calculate annual forest GPP at 1-km spatial resolution from daily estimates. The model was driven by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), the fraction of PAR absorbed by the vegetation canopy (fAPAR), precipitation, and air temperature:

where the subindex i refers to the day of year, while N is the number of days in the year. The maximum light use efficiency εmax was set as 1.2 g MJ−1. PAR was calculated as 46% of incident global solar radiation [29]. fAPAR was computed according to the Roujean and Bréon algorithm [30]. Red (ρRED) and near-infrared (ρNIR) reflectances were first calculated from bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) parameters k0, k1, and k2 for an optimal angular geometry in the solar principal plane. fAPAR was calculated as a linear function of the renormalized difference vegetation index


RDVI = (ρNIR − ρRED)/(ρNIR + ρRED)1/2

εW is the water stress coefficient (CWS) as used in [31] that accounts for short-term water stress


CWS = (PRE/PET + 1)/2


(3)


where precipitation (PRE) and potential evapotranspiration (PET, calculated from air temperature and incoming global solar radiation through the Jensen-Haise equation [32]) are accumulated for 60 days. εT is the TMIN_scalar used in the MOD17 algorithm [33] to account for thermal stress caused by low temperatures: a linear ramp function of daily minimum air temperature with thresholds depending on the vegetation type.The second model was Biome-BGC [15,16], a bio-geochemical model that, based on daily meteorological data, site information (i.e., soil, vegetation, and site conditions) and parameters describing the ecophysiological features of the vegetation, is able to simulate fluxes and storage of water, carbon, and nitrogen at different spatial scales in terrestrial ecosystems. In particular, Biome-BGC identifies a quasi-equilibrium condition (the so-called climax) with the local ecoclimatic situation, thus quantifying the initial amounts of all carbon and nitrogen pools. Version 4.2 is available at the Numerical Terradynamic Simulation Group (NTSG) website (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/biome-bgc.php) and was used together with a set of ecophysiological parameters calibrated for the considered forest types [17]. More information on the use and setup of Biome-BGC in the study area can be found in [19].NPP is the difference between GPP and RA, with RA equal to the sum of growth (RG) and maintenance (RM) respirations. Since Biome-BGC assumes that the considered ecosystem is in equilibrium with its surroundings, its outputs must be corrected to account for actual ecosystem conditions. Note that Equation (1) estimates the GPP of all vegetation growing in each pixel. Therefore, it also must be corrected to account only for forest GPP. The correction applied in the present study was based on the distance to climax of the ecosystems concept [34], from which it is deduced that ratios of actual to potential tree cover or GSV are representative of the ecosystem development status or, in other words, its distance to climax [20]. The correction to the simulated carbon fluxes was carried out following the methodology explained in [20]:

NPP = f (GPP − RG) − v RM

where GPP is estimated by Equation (1), while f and v are, respectively, the ratios of actual to potential tree cover and GSV and are calculated as follows:

f = (1 − e−v LAI)/(1 − e−LAI)

578,"Peninsular Spain, located between −10° and 3° longitude and between 36° and 40° latitude, is a heterogeneous and large region of Southwestern Europe. The climate ranges from Atlantic to semiarid following a NW−SE gradient. Annual precipitation ranges from more than 2000 mm to less than 200 mm following the same gradient. The elevation ranges from sea level to 3479 m. These features favor the existence of a great range of different ecosystems [35,36].Human activity has also had an impact in the study area [37], resulting in a great heterogeneity in Spanish forest types and characteristics. Of the total area, 55% is covered by wooded lands, while 37% is covered by tree species [38]. Spanish forests can be grouped into five main types, i.e., evergreen broadleaved forest (EBF), low-altitude deciduous broadleaved forest (LDBF), high-altitude deciduous broadleaved forest (HDBF), low-altitude evergreen needleleaved forest (LENF), and high-altitude evergreen needleleaved forest (HENF) [19]. Quercus ilex is the most widespread broadleaved tree species (total broadleaves occupy 46% of the tree-covered area), while Pinus halepensis is the most widespread needleleaved one (total needleleaves occupy 34% of the tree-covered area).", 3.

579,"Spanish forests’ field data were derived from the third Spanish Forest Inventory (NFI3), performed during 1997–2007 [38]. A total of 92,340 plots distributed in a regular 1 km × 1 km grid were surveyed in the study area. Each plot consists of four concentric circular subplots with 5 m, 10 m, 15 m, and 25 m radii. Trees with 75 mm ≤ DBH < 125 mm, 125 mm ≤ DBH < 225 mm, 225 mm ≤ DBH < 425 mm, and DBH ≥ 425 mm were measured respectively in each subplot at a breast height of 130 cm. For each of the five forest types considered in the present study, a subset of NFI3 plots was selected considering the spatial and species homogeneity and the availability of site information. Specifically, only NFI3 plots with Quercus ilex, Quercus robur, Fagus sylvatica, Pinus pinea, and Pinus nigra were selected for EBF, LDBF, HDBF, LENF, and HENF, respectively. In addition, it was imposed that the 9 pixels in a 3 × 3-pixel window of a forest type map (see Section 3.3) centered in each plot presented the same forest type (except for LDBF—at least 3 of 9—and LENF—at least 8 of 9—due to plot availability). For each plot, GSV and current annual increment (CAI) observations of the four subplots were added to obtain values representative of the whole plot. Table 1 summarizes the data used per forest type.", 3. Study Area and Data, 3.2. Reference Forest Observations,3
580,"Most datasets used for the current NPP modeling were produced during previous research exercises. The SIOSE (Land Cover and Use Information System of Spain) land cover database was provided by ©Instituto Geográfico Nacional through http://www.siose.es/web/guest/descargar. It consists of a cartographic scale 1:25000 polygon database generated by photointerpreting and digitalizing reference data, which included SPOT5 and Landsat-5 TM images together with local ground ancillary data [26,39]. The land cover data contains the percentage of surface occupied by each of the present classes in each polygon. With the help of the global 3 arc second digital elevation model from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission [27] (downloaded from http://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/data), the original legend of the land cover data was regrouped into the five forest types mentioned in Table 1 using an 800-m threshold to separate low- and high-altitude classes [19]. The resulting forest type map is shown in Figure 2a.Daily ground measurements of precipitation, and minimum and maximum air temperature were provided by the Spanish Meteorological Agency (www.aemet.es) from ~400 meteorological stations distributed throughout the study area. Ordinary kriging was used to interpolate these data and obtain daily 1-km spatial resolution maps during the 2005–2012 period. These maps were used as inputs in MT-CLIM [24] to simulate daylength, daylight average partial pressure of water vapor, and daily average air temperature. Version 4.3 of the code was used and is available at the NTSG website (http://www.ntsg.umt.edu/project/mt-clim.php).SEVIRI products LSA-201 (downward surface shortwave flux estimated every 30 min, MDSSF) and LSA-203 (daily downward surface shortwave flux, DIDSSF) [40] for the period 2007–2012 were acquired from the LSA-SAF server (http://landsaf.meteo.pt). The images were reprojected to a regular longitude/latitude 1-km spatial resolution grid. MDSSF was used to calculate DIDSSF when it was unavailable. Incoming global solar radiation was obtained by applying ANN to the abovementioned air temperature and precipitation maps [22] and was used to fill DIDSSF gaps and to calculate DIDSSF for the years 2005 and 2006. To apply the gap-filling procedure, a relationship was used between the two datasets, which were previously validated [22,23].The main ecoclimatic features of the five Spanish forest types derived from the datasets exposed above are summarized in Table 2.MODIS products MCD43A1 and MCD43A2 [41] for the period 2005–2012 were retrieved from the online Reverb, courtesy of the NASA EOSDIS Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center, USGS/Earth Resources Observation and Science Center, Sioux Falls, South Dakota (reverb.echo.nasa.gov). MCD43A1 is a 500-m spatial resolution 8-day composite containing the BRDF parameters k0, k1, and k2. fAPAR was computed through the methodology reported in [30] from the BRDF parameters contained in MCD43A1 images (see Section 2), which were previously reprojected to a regular latitude/longitude 1-km spatial resolution grid. A noise-reduction and gap-filling method dependent on the quality of the measurements [42] was applied, and the 8-day fAPAR was linearly interpolated to obtain daily images.Soil texture (clay, sand, and silt content) maps [25] were downloaded from the European Soil Database (http://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu/resource-type/european-soil-database-soil-properties) and reprojected to regular longitude/latitude 1-km spatial resolution grids comprising the study area.A 1-km spatial resolution rooting depth map was obtained from a calibration of Biome-BGC in the study area. Daily GPP was first calculated using a production efficiency model optimized for the study area [8] in four sites where EC towers were placed. Several daily GPP series were also simulated using Biome-BGC for the same sites and varying the rooting depth. Both series were compared, and the optimum rooting depth was chosen as the one that resulted in the minimum root mean square error between them. After ascertaining that this methodology improved the accuracy of GPP simulated using Biome-BGC by comparing to EC-derived GPP, the methodology was extended to the whole study area and the rooting depth map was obtained. Detailed methods on its production can be found in [19]. Note that rooting depth used by Biome-BGC does not indicate depth to bedrock. Instead, it refers to an effective soil depth defined as the depth at which plants are able to grow roots [15].A 30-m spatial resolution GSV map was obtained from the combination of around 50000 NFI3 plot-level GSV estimations and a multitemporal Landsat dataset (~8000 Landsat-5 TM and Landsat-7 ETM+ scenes covering the study area and the NFI3 period, 1997–2007). A total of 805 predictors were calculated from Landsat spectral reflectances including time metrics, texture metrics, and vegetation indices. The most important predictors were identified by means of a guided regularized random forests algorithm (e.g., [43,44]) and used to generate the GSV map. Google Earth Engine [45] was used for data management. Detailed methods on the production of this map can be found in [28]. The 30-m spatial resolution GSV map was aggregated to 1-km spatial resolution (Figure 2c) for coherence with the other datasets used in the present study.", 3. Study Area and Data, 3.3.

581,"The NPP modeling strategy described in Section 2 was applied at a spatial resolution of 1 km and a daily temporal scale for the study period (2005–2012) using the inputs described in Section 3. In Equation (4), two GPPs were used: the one estimated by the production efficiency model (GPPPEM, Figure 2b) and the one simulated by Biome-BGC (GPPBGC) [19], which also simulated RG and RM. In Equation (6), the GSV map and the data reported in Table 3 [46] were used.The NPP estimated by the two methods was assessed for the pixels containing the NFI3 plots indicated in Table 1. For each of these pixels, a reference annual NPP was calculated from NFI3 CAI as


NPPNFI3 = 50 CAI ρ C/D


(7)

D being the stem carbon allocation ratio (Table 3), and the 50 factor accounting for both the unit conversion to m3 ha−1 and the transformation from carbon mass to dry mass (2 kg kg−1). Annual NPP was calculated for the same locations following the methodology reported in Section 2, but GSV from NFI3 was used instead of the GSV map to test the modeling strategy in the best possible conditions. The calculated NPP was compared to NPPNFI3 by means of the following statistics calculated by forest type: coefficient of determination (R2), mean bias error (MBE), and root mean square error (RMSE).", 4. Data Processing, 4.1. Simulation of Forest NPP in Current Condition,4
582,"The simulation of GPP, RG, and RM through the use of Biome-BGC (as indicated in Section 4.1) was driven by different daily precipitation and minimum and maximum air temperature datasets, which led to different daylight average partial pressure of water vapor, and daily average air temperature through the use of MT-CLIM.A large dataset of future climate projections over the study area is available through https://www.adaptecca.es. It contains, among others, projections of daily maximum and minimum air temperature and precipitation for different climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) at both spatial and station levels. However, they are obtained from different models resulting in big differences among the produced datasets. Moreover, the spatial resolution of the spatialized projections (11 km) is too coarse compared to the one used in the present study (1 km), while projections at station-level are restricted to the locations where meteorological stations from the Spanish Meteorological Agency are placed. Furthermore, climatic projections generally present great uncertainties [47], especially for precipitation. Therefore, to address the range of variation of the climate projections corresponding to the different climate change scenarios (e.g., no mitigation, soft mitigation, and hard mitigation) that can be found in the literature, a simplified dataset of possible future changes in meteorological variables (i.e., daily precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperature) was generated for use in the present study.The original 2005–2012 series were taken as reference and the same variation was applied to each value in each series. In the case of air temperature, absolute increments (ΔT) of 1 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C, and 4 °C were applied to both minimum and maximum series. In the case of precipitation, relative variations were applied in the form of reductions (δPRE) of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% of its reference value. These variations were chosen to take into account climatic projections over the study area from both global and regional climatic models for different CO2 emission scenarios [47]. The four modified air temperature series, the four modified precipitation series, and the reference series were combined to obtain 24 new 8-year sets of simulated daily GPP, RG, and RM through Biome-BGC. Finally, the corresponding NPP series were calculated for each set using Equation (4) fed with the same GSV as in the current condition, i.e., from the GSV map.", 4. Data Processing, 4.2. Simulation of Forest NPP in Future Condition,4
583,"The assessment of estimated NPP per forest type is illustrated by the scatterplots in Figure 3. The largest NPPNFI3 explained variance amongst forest types was obtained for EBF with almost 70% (R2 = 0.69); ~60% (R2 = 0.60, R2 = 0.62, and R2 = 0.59 respectively) was obtained for LDBF, HDBF, and LENF; and slightly less than 50% (R2 = 0.46) for HENF. Small scattering was observed for EBF except for a great NPPNFI3 plot, which was heavily underestimated. A general overestimation, more notable for great NPP values, was also observed. LDBF and HDBF exhibited similar behavior: estimates generally followed the 1:1 line until around 300 g m−2 a−1, where scattering appeared (more for LDBF), and they saturated at around 700 g m−2 a−1. LENF presented a constant underestimation, but with small scattering. HENF exhibited more scattering than LENF, but estimates followed the 1:1 line until around 200 g m−2 a−1, where saturation appeared.The accuracy statistics resulting from the NPP assessment are reported in Table 4. The greatest difference between the two NPPEST to explain the NPPNFI3 variance was found for LENF with 10 percentage points (pp) (from R2 = 0.59 with GPPPEM to R2 = 0.49 with GPPBGC). Around half this difference was found for EBF, LDBF, and HENF (respectively from R2 = 0.69, R2 = 0.60, and R2 = 0.46 with GPPPEM to R2 = 0.74, R2 = 0.56, and R2 = 0.51 with GPPBGC), while only 2 pp were found for HDBF (from R2 = 0.62 with GPPPEM to R2 = 0.60 with GPPBGC). More of the NPPNFI3 variance was explained for broadleaved forests than for needleleaved forests independently of the used GPP. According to the calculated MBE, NPP was overestimated in broadleaved forests but underestimated in needleleaved forests. In addition, the MBE obtained for HDBF and LENF was an order of magnitude greater than for the rest of the forest types. RMSE was high for all forest types compared to their corresponding mean NPPNFI3 values (114 g m−2 a−1, 418 g m−2 a−1, 421 g m−2 a−1, 287 g m−2 a−1, 209 g m−2 a−1 respectively for EBF, LDBF, HDBF, LENF, and HENF).Figure 4a,b show, respectively, the average annual forest NPP calculated using Equation (4) with GPPPEM and with GPPBGC. The spatial pattern was the same in both cases: NPP was larger in the NW and decreases towards the SE, except in the most southern and the most eastern (this one located in the north too) regions, where NPP was also great. NPP calculated with GPPBGC was generally smaller than NPP calculated with GPPPEM. Table 5 summarizes the basic statistics of the mentioned GPPs and their corresponding NPPs per forest type. GPPPEM maxima are greater than GPPBGC maxima for broadleaved forest, but the opposite relationship occurred for needleleaved forests. GPPPEM means were greater than GPPBGC ones for all forest types. NPP maxima and means exhibited a similar behavior. However, these differences do not seem very relevant, especially the differences in the mean values.", 5. Results, 5.1. NPP in Current Condition,5
584,"Simulated annual forest NPP in possible future scenarios of climate change presents a spatial pattern similar to that exhibited during 2005–2012 (Figure 4a,b). This is shown in Figure 4c, where the average annual forest NPP calculated using Equation (4) with GPPBGC, ΔT = +2 °C, and δPRE = –20% for the corresponding 8-year period is represented. However, it can be appreciated how the regions that already presented great (or small) NPP in Figure 4a,b present even greater (or smaller) NPP in Figure 4c. The basic statistics of Figure 4c are summarized in Table 6. A comparison of Table 6 with NPP with GPPBGC in Table 5 illustrates that minima are all practically the same; maxima are greater in Table 6 for all forest types; means are greater in Table 6 except for HENF, for which it is smaller; and standard deviations are greater in Table 6 for EBF, LDBF, and LENF, while they are nearly equal for HDBF and HENF.Figure 5 shows the variation of annual forest NPP with air temperature increments (ΔT) and precipitation reductions (δPRE) for a single pixel of each forest type. The main eco-climatic features of the selected pixels together with their geographic coordinates are summarized in Table 7. The pixels were selected for the sake of homogeneity and representativeness: at least a 5 × 5-pixel window (7 × 7 for HENF) with the same forest type surrounding each pixel was imposed, and they are also representative of the main eco-climatic features of each forest type (Table 1). In the case of EBF, the surface is nearly flat and only slight decreases in NPP due to increases in air temperature were found. NPP in LDBF was strongly reduced when both an increment of air temperature of at least 2 °C and a reduction of precipitation of at least 30% were combined, but a softer reduction in NPP was also observed when precipitation was reduced by 40% independently of the variation in air temperature. NPP in HDBF did not present any significant change due to increments in air temperature nor to reductions in precipitation. NPP in LENF was slightly but consistently decreased as precipitation was reduced. HENF presented a dependence of NPP with precipitation too, but the reduction in NPP due to reductions in precipitation was stronger than in the case of LENF.", 5. Results, 5.2. NPP in Future Condition,5
585,"The present study focuses on the use of a modeling strategy for the simulation of annual forest NPP over peninsular Spain through the combination of a production efficiency model, which was used for the estimation of annual forest GPP, and the bio-geochemical model Biome-BGC, which was used to simulate GPP, RG, and RM. Both models were previously optimized for their application in the study area [8,19] and were driven by a combination of remote sensing observations and ground meteorological data. The modeling strategy described in [20] was developed to overcome one of Biome-BGC’s limitations, i.e., the assumption of the considered ecosystem to be in equilibrium with its surroundings (climax conditions), through the correction of Biome-BGC’s outputs to account for actual conditions of the considered ecosystem and through the use of a production efficiency model for the estimation of GPP. However, other limitations of Biome-BGC and the production efficiency model must be taken into account to evaluate the obtained results. The space where the models are applied is divided into cells and the simulations take place individually in each cell without interaction with other cells during the functioning of the models. Therefore, the spatial relationships and variations observed in the outputs of the models are provided by the ones already present in their inputs. This is important when interpreting the spatial patterns presented in Figure 4. Furthermore, both models assign a single ecosystem functional type (in the case of the present study, a forest type) to each cell and assume that it is homogeneous independently of the spatial resolution at which the models work and that it does not change through time. This affects light use efficiency in the production efficiency model and the ecophysiological parameters in Biome-BGC, but it is also relevant to interpret the results of NPP simulation in future condition because the possibility of the current forest type being replaced by another ecosystem is not contemplated. Only the current forest type reactions to possible variations in air temperature and precipitation due to climate change were therefore analyzed.The two different GPP sources, i.e., the one estimated through the production efficiency model (GPPPEM) and the one simulated using Biome-BGC (GPPBGC), that are involved in the calculation of NPP were validated against daily EC-derived GPP from different ecosystems (forest included) in a previous study [19]. Coefficients of correlation between 0.64 and 0.86 and between 0.52 and 0.75 were respectively obtained for GPPPEM and GPPBGC, while RMSE ranged from 0.7 g m−2 d−1 to 1.7 g m−2 d−1 and from 0.9 g m−2 d−1 to 1.8 g m−2 d−1. In the present study, new datasets (e.g., the respirations simulated using Biome-BGC and the GSV map) with their own uncertainty were incorporated into the calculation of NPP, which was assessed through an indirect validation against a reference NPP (NPPNFI3) calculated from CAI observations derived from forest inventory measurements.The strength of this approach is to combine the directly derived GPPPEM with all respirations and allocations simulated by the bio-geochemical model Biome-BGC. However, actual NPP is difficult to predict due to the numerous factors and human-induced disturbances affecting it [48]. In the current case, i.e., in all applications over large areas, the modeling approach must be based on easily collectable and available information otherwise its applicability is missed. Additionally, the accuracy of the NPP estimates is also strictly dependent on the quality of the drivers utilized, among which GSV is one of the most important [49].GSV from NFI3 was currently used instead of the GSV map to evaluate the modeling strategy in the best possible conditions. As expected, greater relative errors were obtained for NPP than for GPP. Some differences in the results obtained among the five forest types can be appreciated. The greatest R2 and smallest errors were obtained for EBF, while the smallest R2 and greatest errors were obtained for HENF. This is in agreement with the results obtained in Italy by [49], who tested a similar NPP modeling approach against reference CAI data collected by the Italian National Forest Inventory. They also found a clear NPP underestimation for Mediterranean pines, which can be partly attributed to a suboptimal parameterization of the coefficients reported in Table 3. However, there is no conclusive indication that one GPP should be preferred over the other. Therefore, the use of GPPBGC in the calculation of NPP in future condition is justified.", 6. Discussion, 6.1. NPP in Current Condition,6
586,"Some tests were firstly performed using the scenarios from AdapteCCa (https://www.adaptecca.es) data as inputs in Biome-BGC for some sites where station-level AdapteCCa data obtained with the same model were available. Daily GPP and respirations were simulated for 2006–2100. However, unexpected extreme (i.e., both very high and very low) carbon fluxes values were obtained. This, together with the abundance of different models that provide different climate projections and their high uncertainty, led to the decision of generating a simplified dataset of possible future changes in meteorological variables trying to cover most of the climatic projections (both from different models and for different scenarios). This simplified dataset was elaborated by applying variations to a reference dataset that was previously used in the simulation of GPP by both the production efficiency model and Biome-BGC [19], the daily precipitation and maximum and minimum air temperature for the 2005–2012 period, so different sets of 8-year periods were produced instead of a long time series as in the case of AdapteCCa. Thus, the results presented in Section 5.2 might approximately correspond to different 8-year periods over the present century depending on whether any actions are taken to mitigate climate change and how intense their application is.Still, the generation of the abovementioned 8-year datasets presents some important limitations. First, there are some limitations regarding the direction of the modifications applied to the reference period. Both global and regional climatic models predict increment in air temperature in the study area for the different emission scenarios. Therefore, only increments in temperature were considered. Whereas in the case of precipitation, an increase is also expected globally, but regional models predict reductions in annual precipitation over the study area. Therefore, only reductions in precipitation were considered. Second, there are limitations regarding the temporal variation of the applied modifications. While climatic models usually provide, for example, different variations for winter and summer within the same year, the datasets generated in the present study were produced by applying the same modification to each value in the series, that is, a regular variation. Regarding the spatial variation, which is especially relevant in the case of precipitation, it is provided by the spatial variation of the reference series itself.Other limitations of the current approach are due to the use of a bio-geochemical model, which can be suboptimal for the simulation of future climatic conditions. Biome-BGC respirations are actually simulated using a Q10 function of air temperature [50], which however does not account for the possible response and adaptation of vegetation to high air temperature [51]. The consideration of stable GSV for driving the NPP modeling strategy in future condition is also disputable but can be justified by the unpredictable dependence of this forest attribute on human activities (tree cutting and thinning operations, wildfires of arson origin, etc.).When comparing the annual forest NPP shown in Figure 4b (reference period 2005–2012) and Figure 4c (ΔT = +2 °C and δPRE = –20%), it can be appreciated how NPP is greater in Figure 4c in the regions where it was already great in Figure 4b and smaller in Figure 4c in the regions where it was already small in Figure 4b, that is, it presents a more extreme variation in Figure 4c. This is supported by the statistics reported in Table 5 and Table 6: maxima and standard deviations of NPP are greater in Table 6 (corresponding to Figure 4c, ΔT = +2 °C, and δPRE = –20%). The increment of NPP in already very productive regions (mostly the north of the study area) may be caused by the increment in air temperature and the water not being a limiting factor. On the other hand, the reduction of NPP in already scant productive regions (mainly the SE of the study area) may be caused by the reduction in precipitation and water already being a limiting factor during 2005–2012. From Figure 5 it can be appreciated how, although no significant changes are found in annual NPP for EBF nor HDBF, precipitation is the main factor responsible for NPP reductions in the rest of the forest types (LDBF, LENF, and HENF).", 6. Discussion, 6.2. NPP in Future Condition,6
587,"The current research was aimed at investigating the NPP dynamics of Spanish forests both in the current and expected climate conditions. The analysis was conducted using an integrated modeling approach applied at high spatial and temporal resolutions (i.e., 1 km2 and daily) in order to grasp the most relevant variations that characterize this highly heterogeneous Mediterranean country.The main conclusions that can be drawn from the experiment are:When applied in current climate conditions, the integrated modeling approach is capable of reproducing the general NPP variability of broadleaved forests in Spain (R2 > 0.60) but underestimates the NPP of needleleaf forests.When applied in future climate conditions, the approach produces results that can be explained considering the ecoclimatic features of the present forest types. NPP increases are predicted for more temperate-humid forests, while decreases are predicted for forest already subject to water limitation.All these results contribute to the understanding of the behavior and the risks of Mediterranean ecosystems in the context of expected climate variability. However, they are affected by the limitations in model functioning and the datasets used. Therefore, future research will focus on improving the model capacity to simulate NPP in warmer and drier climate conditions and identifying more plausible future scenarios.", 7. Conclusions,None,7
588,"Global oceans are an important sink of atmospheric CO2 and uptake approximately 30% of the global anthropogenic CO2 emissions [1]. As the global ocean uptake of CO2 increases by a rate proportional to the atmospheric CO2, substantial differences exist between oceans and marginal seas [1,2]. The changing air-sea exchange of CO2 in marginal seas, particularly those at high-latitude, is found to be the major source of uncertainties in the estimate of ocean CO2 uptake [3,4]. As the atmospheric CO2 is as rather globally homogenous, sea surface partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) in the marginal sea is the key component for precisely determining the direction of the air-sea exchange of CO2. Therefore, deriving maps of the changing pCO2 for marginal seas over time is critical for precise estimate of global air-sea exchange and ocean uptake of CO2 [2,3,5].Generally, sea surface pCO2 is jointly determined by biogeochemical processes, vertical and horizontal mixing of sea water, and the air-sea exchange of CO2 [6,7]. Many sea surface variables related to these processes are can be retrieved from remote sensing images. Given their vast spatial coverages, remotely sensed sea surface variables have increasingly been used in sea surface pCO2 estimation. Remotely sensed Chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) is commonly used as an indicator of biological activities in water [8]. Sea surface temperature (SST) largely determines the solubility of CO2 in sea water and has been frequently used to estimate pCO2 from remote sensing [9,10,11,12,13]. In addition, bacteria respiration produces CO2 by decomposing dissolved organic matter (DOM) [14,15]. Therefore, absorption of colored dissolved organic matter (aCDOM) retrieved from remote sensing images was used in sea surface pCO2 estimation [16,17]. Furthermore, after [18] found from in-situ measurements that sea surface salinity (SSS) was highly related to sea surface pCO2, SSS derived directly from remote sensing images or remotely sensed aCDOM were adopted to support sea surface pCO2 estimate [16,19]. Kd_490nm, a proxy of water transparency, was derived from remote sensing and included in sea surface pCO2 estimation to indicate the effect of biological activities [16]. Mixed layer depth (MLD) determines thermal stratification between different water masses and, however, is not retrievable with remote sensing approaches. Therefore, some studies used the MLD obtained from ocean models to support the derivation of sea surface pCO2 maps [9,12]. Similarly, model-yield gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP) were also included to support pCO2 estimation by approximating the biological control on pCO2 in sea water [9,12].Sea surface pCO2 in many global marginal seas have been estimated with various remote sensing supported approaches [9,12,16,17,20,21,22,23]. Most of the studies chose the variables based on empirical knowledge and focused on deriving pCO2 maps with small estimate errors (e.g., RMSE). However, few studies have investigated the spatiotemporal variabilities of the variable’s relevance to sea surface pCO2 in marginal seas. Considering the high spatial variabilities in the controlling forces of sea surface pCO2 in marginal seas, some studies divided the targeted seas into sub-basins/subsets and separately constructed models for pCO2 retrieval in each of the sub-basins/subset [12,22,24]. Though this strategy produced maps of good quality in the sub-basins/subsets, it provided little knowledge on the variables’ relevance to pCO2 distribution. Furthermore, Reference [25] regarded the sea surface pCO2 in the targeted area as a mixture of the pCO2 controlled by different processes (e.g., vertical mixing and biological uptake) and determined each of the processes separately from different sets of variables. Despite the successfully applications in multiple marginal seas [10,25,26], their method was often limited to pCO2 estimation in summer time and thus fails to provide information for other seasons. Overall, large space remains for investigation on variables’ relevance (importance) in sea surface pCO2 estimate across different time and space.The Baltic Sea is a semi-enclosed marginal sea located in northern Europe. The carbon budget of the Baltic Sea displays considerable seasonal and interannual variabilities. To date, the few studies attempting to estimate sea surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea using remote sensing approaches, e.g., [12]., have barely provided information on the variables’ relevance/importance to the pCO2 estimate for this marginal sea. In this study, we aimed to analyze the importance of different variables for pCO2 estimation and derive improved monthly pCO2 maps for the Baltic Sea from 2002 to 2011. We conducted the following: (1) filtering the in-situ pCO2 data for the model training and validation; (2) assessing the relative importance of the input variables for the pCO2 estimation on different spatial and seasonal scales; and (3) deriving pCO2 maps for the Baltic Sea.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
589,"The Baltic Sea is located at high latitudes (55–60° N) in Europe. As the sun illumination and temperature there exhibit significant seasonal changes, the Baltic Sea and adjacent terrestrial ecosystems also undergo high seasonality. In addition, the wide span of the Baltic Sea in latitude forms a large spatial gradient in sun illumination and the corresponding environment condition, like SST. The Baltic Sea has restricted water exchange with the open North Atlantic Ocean via the Danish straits and is a semi-enclosed marginal sea. More than 600 rivers drain the catchment of total 1.7 million km2 and export to the Baltic Sea substantial freshwater and terrigenous substances, including organic carbon [27,28,29,30]. Therefore, the Baltic Sea is characterized with a high concentration of CDOM, and most part of the sea presents as “brown water”. With varying inputs from different rivers, the sub-basins of the Baltic Sea create highly heterogeneous biogeochemical conditions in this marginal sea. Consequently, the pCO2 distribution in the Baltic Sea displays evident seasonality and spatial heterogeneity [31]. Upwelling characterized with evident seasonality and spatiality occurs frequently in the Baltic Sea and brings up deep water of high pCO2 up to 2000 µatm to the sea surface [32,33]. The high concentration of nutrients brought up together with the deep water leads to cyanobacteria and phytoplankton blooms after the upwelling event, which further complicates the pCO2 distribution in the Baltic Sea [34].Till now, nearly all the pCO2 related studies in the Baltic Sea were based on in-situ measurements from ship and/or buoys, and the findings are often valid for limited sites of the sea. Therefore, analyzing variables’ relevance and obtaining reliable pCO2 maps is critical for better understanding the carbon cycle and the air-sea exchange in the Baltic Sea [35].", 2. Study Area,None,2
590,"The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board Aqua satellite was designed for ocean surface investigations. The sensor maps the earth every two days from July 2002 on. A MODIS image consists of 36 spectral bands covering the spectrum of wavelength from 0.63 to 14.38 µm. Images from MODIS Aqua have been successfully used to detect coastal water clarity [36], survey red tides [37], map lake suspended matter [38], and retrieve coastal dissolved organic carbon [39]. Variables, like Chl-a and SST retrieved from MODIS-Aqua images with already mature algorithms, have been widely used to estimate sea surface pCO2 or simulate sea surface CO2 flux in different oceans and marginal seas [11,16,17,40,41]. From the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/), we obtained the level-3 monthly mean MODIS products of PAR, Kd_490 nm and SST covering the period of August 2002–October 2020. All data have a spatial resolution equivalent to 4×4 km at the equator (Table 1).The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) on board Envisat satellite was designed for ocean color observation. During its life span from 2002 to 2011, MERIS mapped the earth every 1–3 days and measured water surface radiances in 15 spectral bands from visible to infrared spectrum. Up to now, MERIS data have been frequently used to investigate water related issues in global ocean and marginal seas, including mapping sea algae coverage [42], detecting phytoplankton bloom [43] and cyanobacterial bloom [44], and estimating Chl-a, aCDOM, and suspended matter [45,46,47,48,49]. Most of these studies targeted at European lakes and seas and demonstrated the great potential of MERIS data for investigating these waters. Specifically, [45] found that Chl-a retrieved from MERIS for the Baltic Sea had similar distributions to that of in-situ measurements.The MERIS data from the MERCI data base (https://merisrr-merci-ds.eo.esa.int/merci) were used to retrieve Chl-a and aCDOM for the Baltic Sea with the Free University of Berlin (FUB) processor which were especially developed for European coastal waters. Invalid pixels (i.e., land, mixture of land and water, various cloud types, and cloud shadow) were masked out from MERIS images before the Chl-a and aCDOM retrieval. The performance of Chl-a and aCDOM retrieved from MERIS with FUB processor in the Baltic Sea were assessed to be excellent [49,50]. In this study, the daily Chl-a and aCDOM derived from MERIS images were aggregated monthly and resampled to 4×4 km. The Chl-a and aCDOM derived from the full MERIS archive spans from July 2002 to December 2011. Comparison of the contributions of the Chl-a products from MODIS and MERIS to pCO2 estimation in the method employed here did not show significant differences (Figure S2).", 3. Data, 3.1. Remote Sensing Products,3
591,"MLD and SSS are important variables for pCO2 estimates. However, remotely sensed SSS have much coarser resolutions than other variables, such as Chl-a, and MLD is not yet obtainable from remote sensing. Alternatively, modeled MLD and SSS have been applied in many studies on sea surface pCO2 estimation [9,12,20,51,52]. Therefore, we employed the monthly MLD and SSS produced by the NEMO-NORDIC model which is a a Baltic and North Sea model based on the NEMO ocean engine and a local singular evolutive interpolated Kalman (LSEIK)filter data assimilation with a spatial resolution of 4 × 4 km [53] (Table 1). Validation of the modeled SSS against the station observation demonstrated a bias smaller than 0.5 ppt and a RMSE of 0.5 ppt [53].", 3. Data, 3.2. Modeled Data,3
592,"We used all the in-situ sea surface pCO2 measurements available in the Baltic sea during August 2002–November 2011 (Table 2 and Figure 1). They included the data from the Surface Ocean CO₂ Atlas (SOCAT) (2nd Version) [54], the measurements from a moored buoy at Östergarnsholm site [55], and data from [56].All the data in SOCAT have undergone quality control and were of error < 10 µatm [54,57]. We used pCO2 measurements acquired from 2002 to 2011 to match the remotely sensed variables. The data from SOCAT for this period were obtained from the Finnpartner vessels which travelled between Lübeck and Helsinki every second day [58]. The pCO2 measurements are available every 1–2 min and appear as a series of points distributed along the ship tracks (Figure 1A).At the Östergarnsholm site, the sea surface pCO2 is measured by a submersible autonomous moored instrument (SAMI) mounted on a buoy mooring one kilometer east off the island Östergarnsholm in the central Baltic Sea (Figure 1A). The SAMI sensor was installed four meters below the water surface and has recorded the pCO2 there every 30 or 60 min from 2005 May to the present [55]. The pCO2 measurement from Östergarnsholm site also fulfills the accuracy criterion of <10 µatm.The pCO2 data used by [56] filled the data gap left by the previous two data sources in the Gulf of Bothnia. The data set consisted of both manual bottle measurements from discrete stations and continuous ferry box measurements obtained with the same method as the vessel data in SOCAT (Figure 1A). The measurements were mainly from the year of 2006, 2009, and 2010. More details about the data are available from [56]).", 3. Data, 3.3. In-Situ Data,3
593,"Random forest is a tree-assembled model where the trees are constructed based on a set training samples [59]. Random forest has shown excellent performance in classification and regression [60,61]. Therefore, it has been used in various fields. For example, it has been used to estimate gross primary production of vegetation from remote sensing images [62], downscaling the soil moisture data and chlorophyll fluorescence of coarse resolutions etc. [63,64]. With respect to pCO2 estimation from remote sensing data [17] derived pCO2 maps for the Gulf of Mexico with an RMSE of 31.7 µatm using a similar tree-based algorithm. In addition, [16] compared random forest with other commonly used approaches (e.g., multiple linear regression) and proved that random forest was a robust algorithm for sea surface pCO2 estimation from remote sensing data in the Gulf of Mexico [16].In this study, random forest models were trained to express the relationship between the in-situ pCO2 measurements and spatially and temporally co-located variables (i.e., Chl-a, aCDOM, SST, PAR, Kd490nm, SSS, and MLD). Each random forest model contained a number of tree (known as Ntree) with each node splitting to a number of leaves (known as Mtry). At each node, a bootstrapped subset of randomly selected training samples was used to construct the relationship between the Mtry variables (e.g., Chl- and SST) and the dependent variable (i.e., pCO2) in the form of split leaves [65]. The tree grew as the nodes were produced and connected in a cascade manner. Each decision tree was independently produced. The forest construction was finished as the trees grew to Ntree, a user-defined number of trees [59]. The final random forest is a set of trees with best performance in expressing the relationship between variables in the training samples. Further details on the random forest model are to be found in Breiman (2001). Each random forest model contained 500 trees (N tree = 500) of the leaf size of three (Mtry = 3). We used the random forest algorithm implemented in the package randomForest [66] for the open access software R [67].Subsequently, the importance of each variable in the random forest model was also extracted and analyzed. The importance of a variable

 in a random forest model indicates its contributions/relevance to the model and the response of corresponding variable to the pCO2 variation in the training data set. For each variable, the importance was derived independently. The variables are not complementary to each other in pCO2 estimate, Therefore, the sum of the variables’ importance cannot stay as constant value, like 100%, across different time and spatial scale.", 4. Methods, 4.1. Random Forest,4
594,"The diurnal differences of sea surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea can reach up to 40 µatm [68], and using only the data from day time or night time would introduce 8% to 36% error on monthly air–sea CO2 fluxes [69]. Pre-analysis also found that using in-situ pCO2 measurements from 24 h for sea surface pCO2 estimation would increase the uncertainty of results by 30–60 µatm (Supplementary Materials Figure S2). Therefore, we only used the in-situ pCO2 measurements obtained during the exact period of the two satellites (i.e., MODIS Aqua and MERIS) passes over the Baltic Sea, i.e., 9:00–14:00 UTC 00. Subsequently, the in-situ data were aggregated monthly to match the frequency of the remotely sensed and modelled variables. The variables exactly co-located to the in-situ pCO2 measurements were extracted and used for random forest model construction and validation.Using the variables (e.g., SST) derived for the months characterized with frequent upwelling occurrences can significantly affect the monthly pCO2 estimates by introducing large biases (Figure S3). Therefore, the upwelling effect should be eliminated to the largest possible extent. To achieve this, we constructed a random forest model using in-situ data from each month as validation data and the rest as training data. All the models with the alternative absence of in-situ data from each month were constructed with identical settings. Inspection on the mean absolute errors (MAE) and RMSE of these models showed that the following monthly data were dominated by upwelling (i.e., large bias): 2003–09, 2006–09, 2006–08, 2009–07, 2009–09, 2009–10, 2011–04, 2011–08, 2011–09, 2011–10 (Figure S4). Nearly all of them were in fall when upwelling prevails in the Baltic Sea [32]. In-situ pCO2 measurements from these months were eliminated from training and validating the model. Sea surface pCO2 maps in these months were not predicted as it would produce misestimation for these months.After narrowing the time window of in-situ pCO2 measurements down to 9:00–14:00, aggregating these in-situ pCO2 measurements monthly, and filtering out the data from the upwelling dominated months, 10,769 in-situ pCO2 measurements with matching variables remained, as shown in Figure S1.", 4. Methods, 4.2. Filtering In-Situ Data,4
595,"We derived the variables’ importance to the pCO2 estimation on two scales: spatially and temporally. On the spatial scale, the random forest models were constructed both for the overall Baltic Sea and its sub-basins indicated in Figure 1B. In each sub-basin, a random forest model was trained with the in-situ in the sub-basin from 2/3 of the months from random selection. Each model was then validated with the in-situ data in the sub-basin from the rest 1/3 months. We constructed 50 random forest models in each sub-basin with the training and validation data selected in such way. In the temporal analysis of the variables’ importance to the pCO2 estimates, the in-situ measurements were divided into different seasons. Specifically, February–April was spring, May–July was summer, and August–October was fall. The limited availability of satellite data due to frequent and extensive cloud coverage in November, December, and January did not allow for such analysis during these months. Like the spatial analysis, in-situ data from 2/3 of the months from random selection were used for training and the rest 1/3 for validation. Fifty random forest models were constructed in each season with the training data selected in the same manner and validated with the corresponding complementary data.", 4. Methods, 4.3. Analyzing Variables’ Importance for pCO2 Estimation,4
596,"We constructed a final random forest model for pCO2 estimation in the entire Baltic Sea. This model was trained with the in-situ pCO2 measurements in odd months of even years (e.g., March 2002) and even months of odd years (e.g., April 2003) and validated with the remaining data. By doing this, both the training and validation data covered each of the 12 months in a year and the pCO2 relevant processes from each month. Exchanging the training data and validation data yielded models with nearly the same performance (Figure S7). The monthly mean pCO2 distribution in the entire Baltic Sea were predicted with this model.The Pearson correlations of the pCO2 estimated with above model to each of the variables were analyzed. In order to speed up the processing, the correlation was analyzed on a 0.5° × 0.5° grid form. In each month, the mean of pCO2 and the means of each targeted variables (e.g., Chl-a) in the same grid cell was derived. The Pearson correlations between pCO2 and each of the variables in each grid cell were obtained across the study period of 2002–2011.", 4. Methods, 4.4. Constructing the Fnal Model for pCO2 Estimation in the Baltic Sea,4
597,"SOM is an artificial neuronal network algorithm which classifies the input samples into a number of classes, based on their Euclidian distance from each other in the space determined by the variables of the input data [20,70]. Often, the number of classes (neuron) are given a priori in a grid format (e.g., 2 × 5). Each class corresponds to a neuron which contains the coefficients determining the relationship between the variables and the dependent variable in the same class, which is also called labelling the class with the dependent variable (output). In the case of sea surface pCO2 estimation with SOM, the remotely sensed variables, like Chl-a and SST, in the training data, are used to calculate the distance between the input samples for classification. In the pCO2 prediction with such a SOM model, the samples will be attributed with the pCO2 of a class to whom the sample show the closest distance to. Detailed description of a SOM application for sea surface pCO2 estimation by remote sensing data is available in Telszewski et al. (2009). SOM and its variants have been widely used to estimate sea surface pCO2 with support of remote sensing products [11,12,20,71,72,73,74]. In this study, we used the SOM algorithm implemented in the R packages of kohonen [75]. We set the size neurons (class) grid to be 25 × 20, in order to have the total number of classes same to the number of trees in the random forest models constructed in this study.Furthermore, multiple linear regression (MLR) has been used in many studies for estimating sea surface pCO2 in marginal seas and performed good results [9,16]. Therefore, we compared the performance of SOM, MLR, and random forest in the sea surface pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea. During the comparison, the same variables were used in the three algorithms without any preselection. Random forest, SOM, and MLR models were trained with the identical data and validated likewise.Two schemes of training data selection were adopted, one with in-situ pCO2 measurements from 2/3 of the months from random selection (scheme Number 1, same as in Section 4.3) and the other one using 2/3 of in-situ pCO2 measurements from random selection as training data (scheme Number 2). Scheme Number 2 was similar to the training data selection by [12]. In both schemes, the validation data were the complementary of the training data.", 4. Methods, 4.5. Comparing the Random Forest to Self-Organized Map (SOM) and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) for pCO2 Estimation in the Baltic Sea,4
598,"On the entire Baltic Sea scale, PAR was the most important variable (mean importance of 66%) for the sea surface pCO2 estimate during 2002–2011. It meant that the errors of the random forest model constructed without PAR would be by 66% higher than that constructed with PAR. PAR was followed by SST, MLD, aCDOM, and SSS with mean importance of 21%, 20%, 15%, and 14%, respectively. Chl-a and Kd_490nm showed the lowest importance of 12% and 10% (Figure 2A).The variables importance differed among the sub-basins of the Baltic Sea. Compare to the pCO2 estimate in the entire Baltic Sea (Figure 2A), the importance of PAR, SST, aCDOM, SSS, and MLD for pCO2 estimation in the Gulf of Finland (i.e., sub-basin No.2) increased by 26%, 13 %, 15%, 5%, and 1% (Figure 2B). For pCO2 estimation in this sub-basin, PAR was still the most importance variable. With the mean importance of 25%, aCDOM and SST are the next most importance variables, followed by SSS and MLD with respective importance of 18% and 16% (Figure 2B). The importance of Chl-a and aCDOM to the pCO2 estimation in the southern Baltic Sea (i.e., sub-basins No.3–4) were similar to that for the overall Baltic Sea, with slightly lower importance of SSS in sub-basin No.3 (Figure 2A). The filtering and time window narrowing down left the Gulf of Bothnia (i.e., sub-basin No.1, Figure 1) with the in-situ data from March 2006 and September 2009. It hampered the construction of random forest model for pCO2 estimate in this sub-basin, due to the strategy of data from 2/3 months for model training. The 50 random forest models constructed in the Baltic Sea, sub-basin No.2, sub-basin No.3, and sub-basin No.4 had the means of 49 µatm, 72 µatm, 50 µatm, and 43 µatm, respectively.The variables’ importance for pCO2 estimation also varied on seasonal scales. For the sea surface pCO2 estimate in the entire Baltic Sea during February–April, PAR was the most important variable with mean importance of 56%, followed by MLD (20%), SSS (15%), SST (15%), and aCDOM (10%). Chl-a and Kd_490nm showed mean importance of 8% (Figure 3B). From May to July, all the variables displayed a similar importance (12–14%), with Kd_490nm (7%) and MLD (5%) (Figure 3C). The low importance of all the variables in May-July means that during this period the alternative absence of the variables in the models constructed did not significantly change the accuracies of the respective models. In another word, during May-July, the combination of any six out of the seven variables used in the study can well cover the variations of pCO2 in the Baltic Sea. For pCO2 estimation in the entire Baltic Sea in the period of August-October, PAR and SST were the first two most important variables with respective importance of 38% and 31% (Figure 3D), followed by MLD (16%) and SSS (12%) and the rest variables with importance of 10%. Chl-a and Kd_490nm showed overall low importance for the pCO2 estimate across Baltic Sea, regardless of the season. From November to the following January, the dense cloud cover over the Baltic Sea region barely allowed any optical images qualified for the retrieval of remote sensed variables. The RMSEs of the 50 models were in the range of 30–80 µatm. The models trained with data from May–July showed the smaller RMSEs (41 µatm) than those trained with in-situ data from February–April and August–October (52 µatm and 55 µatm) (Figure 3D).Overall, PAR showed the highest importance for pCO2 estimate in the Baltic Sea across different seasons and locations. SST was the second most important variable. aCDOM is important for pCO2 estimate in the Gulf of Finland. MLD is important for pCO2 estimate in all the sub-basins of the Baltic Sea but varied seasonally. SSS is important for pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea both spatially and temporally. Chl-a, which has been commonly considered as the determining variable for pCO2, showed low importance to the pCO2 estimate over the entire Baltic Sea and its sub-basins. Kd_490nm showed low importance for pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea across different seasons and sub-basins.", 5. Results, 5.1. Spatiotemporal Characteristics of Variable Importance to pCO2 Estimation,5
599,"The final random forest model for sea surface pCO2 estimation for the entire Baltic Sea engaged all the variables, namely, PAR, Chl-a, aCDOM, SST, Kd_490nm, SSS, and MLD. Its RMSE was 47.8 µatm and its coefficient of determination (i.e., R2) was 0.63 (Figure 4A). The mean absolute error (MAE) of the model was -3.26 µatm, implying a slight overall underestimate of pCO2. The pCO2 predicted with this model exhibited minor overestimates for pCO2 larger than 450 µatm and slight overestimates for pCO2 around 200 µatm (Figure 4A). Both the estimated and observed pCO2 values were mainly in the range of 100–500 µatm, with a few pCO2 observations between 500 µatm and 600 µatm (Figure 4A).The variable importance in the final model was similar to that in Figure 2A. Specifically, PAR was the most important variable, followed by SST, MLD, and aCDOM. Ch-a and Kd_490nm showed the lowest importance (Figure 4B).For the period of August 2002–October 2011, pCO2 maps covering the entire Baltic Sea were retrieved for each month except November, December, January, and February, when the remotely sensed variables were not available due to frequent cloud coverage. Taking the year of 2005 as example (Figure 5), the sea surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea were in the range of 100–500 µatm. On the spatial scale, the pCO2 maps exhibited reasonable transitions in the Baltic Sea (Figure 5). In addition, detailed features of the pCO2 variation were also displayed in those maps. For example, in April 2005, much lower pCO2 was present at the river mouths in the southern Baltic Sea compared to other areas. In May 2005, a strip of low pCO2 was present in the central Baltic Proper. In September 2005, an area of pCO2 higher than both August and October was displayed in the southern Baltic Sea (Figure 5).The sea surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea exhibited significant seasonal variations (Figure 5). Generally, low (undersaturated) pCO2 conditions of 100–300 µatm prevailed during summer months (e.g., July) and the winter months (e.g., October) were characterized by oversaturated pCO2 conditions of up to 500 µatm (Figure 5). The pCO2 variation at different sites in the Baltic Sea also exhibited these characteristics (Figure 6).The sea surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea also showed significant spatial gradient and variation along the months, particularly between April and September (Figure 5). In April, July, and August, the southern central Baltic Sea (excluding the sub-basin No.4 in Figure 1B) often displayed pCO2 approximately 100–150 µatm lower than the northern sub-basins (Figure 5). In May, the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga (Sub-basin No.2 in Figure 1B) showed the lowest pCO2 of 100 µatm in the Baltic Sea. In June, sea surface pCO2 in the two narrow gulfs increased slightly, while the Gulf of Bothnia exhibits its lowest seas surface pCO2 in a year. In September, the sea surface pCO2 in the southern Baltic Sea increased rapidly and displayed a reversed the gradient to that in August. In October, the pCO2 in the entire Baltic Sea was in the range of 380–420 µatm, rather homogenous in comparison to other months (Figure 5 and Figure 6). On the other hand, different areas in the Baltic Sea showed their minimum pCO2 at different time. While the Gulf of Finland (No.42 in Figure 6A) and the Baltic Proper (i.e., No.61 in Figure 6A) had two seasonal minima in May and July, respectively, the Bothnia Sea (i.e., No.8 in Figure 6A) and the Bothnia Bay (No.28 in Figure 6A) showed their only seasonal minima of 180–250 µatm in June. Thirdly, the seasonal change points of pCO2 int the Baltic Sea varied spatially. The pCO2 in the Bothnia Bay and Bothnia Sea started decreasing in May (Figure 6B,C), but the pCO2 in the Baltic Proper and Gulf of Finland in the south showed this change already in April, one month earlier (Figure 6D,E). The pCO2 in the Gulf of Bothnia (i.e., No.8 and 28 in Figure 6A) increased already in July, but such changes in the pCO2 in the southern Baltic Sea were delayed by one month to August. Consequently, in August, when pCO2 in the northern Baltic displayed are almost equal to the values in winter months (Figure 6B,C), pCO2 in the Baltic Proper and Gulf of Finland remained on the level of its summer value (Figure 6D,E). Furthermore, in the Gulf of Finland (i.e., No.42 in Figure 6A), significant inter-annual pCO2 differences were present in April and August (Figure 6D), but, in the Baltic Proper (i.e., No.62, Figure 6A), this occurred in May, July, and August (Figure 6E).Across the period of 2002–2011, the estimated pCO2 were correlated to the variables in the Baltic Sea to different degrees in different directions, varying spatially (Figure 7). The Chl-a-pCO2 correlation varied between −0.5 and 0.5, with general positive correlation in the northern Baltic Sea and negative correlation in the south. The estimated pCO2 were generally negatively correlated to the co-located aCDOM in the Baltic Sea with correlation coefficients ranging from −1 to 0, and the correlation exhibited larger absolute coefficients than Chl-a-pCO2 correlation, particularly in the southern Baltic Sea. SST-pCO2 correlation mostly exhibited negative coefficients (i.e., from −0.5 to 0) in the Baltic Sea, with larger absolute values in the south than in the north. Exceptionally high positive SST-pCO2 correlation, up to 0.8, was present in the very west part of the Baltic Sea. The PAR-pCO2 correlation in the Baltic presented the largest absolute coefficients and pCO2 was mostly negatively correlated to PAR in the entire Baltic Sea (i.e., from −1 to −0.6), showing the same pattern to the SST-pCO2 correlation. Kd_490nm-pCO2 correlation showed the similar pattern as Chl-a-pCO2, with slightly higher absolute coefficients in the southeastern coasts. SSS exhibited high positive correlation to the co-located pCO2 at the coastal waters with values ranging from 0 to 0.8, mostly at 0. MLD was positively correlated to pCO2 in the entire Baltic Sea with large absolute coefficients (0.5–1), except in the very north and west part of the sea.", 5. Results, 5.2. pCO2 Maps from Final Random Forest Model,5
600,"In the both schemes of training and validation data selection described in Section 4.5, majority of validation data were in the range of 100–500 µatm. The pCO2 estimated with random forest were in the same range as the validation data (Figure 8A,C). In contrast, the SOM model constrained the pCO2 estimate into the range of 230–430 µatm (Figure 8A,C), particularly in the scheme No.2 where the training data were the randomly selected pCO2 measurements (Figure 8C). In addition, often one pCO2 value estimated from SOM responded to a large range of observed pCO2, forming evident horizontal features in the cross-validation (Figure 8A,D), particularly when the prediction covers multiple months. However, such patterns were not notable in the pCO2 estimated with random forest or MLR (Figure 8B,E).In an example of 50 experiments where the training data were selected with scheme No.1 (Figure 8A,B), the coefficient of determination of the random forest model prediction was 0.68, much larger than 0.58 and 0.6, the coefficient of determination of the prediction with the SOM and MLR trained with the identical pCO2 measurements. The mean RMSE of the 50 random forest models trained with training data selected with scheme No.1 was 49 µatm, while the mean RMSE of their SOM and MLR counterparts were 55 and 62 µatm (Figure 8C). In the case of training data selected with scheme No.2, the mean RMSE of the 50 random forest models was 24 µatm, significantly lower than 30 and 48 µatm, the respective means of RMSEs of the 50 SOM models and MLR models trained with the same sets of training data (Figure 8F). This indicated random forest outperformed SOM in the pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea.", 5. Results, 5.3. Comparison of Random Forest and SOM,5
601,"We analyzed the importance of different variables to the pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea using random forest on different spatial and temporal scales. It was evident that the spatiotemporal variability in the variable’s importance was high, but some general patterns were visible.Chl-a displayed overall low importance (small contribution) to the pCO2 estimate across different spatial and temporal scales in the Baltic Sea (Figure 2 and Figure 3). The Chl-a-pCO2 correlation in the Baltic Sea was also relatively low, compared to the other variables’ correlation to pCO2 (Figure 7). This was in contrast to previous findings that Chl-a was closely related to pCO2 in global oceans [13] and marginal seas, like the Gulf of Mexico [10]. The limited importance of Chl-a is probably due to: (1) In addition to Chl-a, PAR, and SST are also fundamental factors for the photosynthesis induced biological fixation of carbon; (2) The studies that established or confirmed correlations between Chl-a and pCO2 did not include aCDOM [13,76]. But high correlation (r > 0.9) was found between remotely sensed Chl-a and aCDOM in the Gulf of Mexico [17] and West Florida Shelf [41]. Chl-a and aCDOM also displayed similar spatiotemporal patterns in the Baltic Sea (Figure S8). In the analysis of variables’ importance, aCDOM exhibited a more pronounced response to pCO2 variation than Chl-a (Figure 2A), as it showed higher correlation to pCO2 than Chl-a did (Figure 7). Similarly, sea surface pCO2 in the Gulf of Mexico is more closely related to aCDOM than to Chl-a [41]. However, despite its low importance for sea sur face pCO2 estimate in the Baltic Sea at all the spatial and temporal scales and its general low correlation to pCO2 (Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 7), we still regarded Chl-a as an important variable for the pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea. This is particularly the case during summer (i.e., May–July), when the cyanobacteria and phytoplankton blooms takes place often, uptakes CO2 and reduces the sea surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea [58]. The low importance of Chl-a in May–Jul (summer in this study) (Figure 3B) is very likely that, during this time, the effect of absent Chl-a in the model was compensated by variables highly correlated to Chl- a during in this time (e.g., CDOM and SST). Likewise, the other variables also exhibited low importance for pCO2 estimate in May–July (Figure 3B). Yet, this was the case for the Baltic Sea, as for its applicability in other marginal seas, and the situation should be treated carefully.Overall, PAR exhibited the highest importance for the pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea across different sub-basin and nearly in every season, except summer. In addition, the PAR-pCO2 correlation coefficients were of the largest absolute values among all the variable-pCO2 correlations (Figure 7). The high importance of PAR for pCO2 in the Baltic Sea and its sub-basins and the high correlation of this variable to sea surface pCO2 are attributed to the high seasonality of the sun illumination. Located at the high latitude of the Baltic Sea 54–66°N (Figure 1), the sun illumination in the central Baltic Sea, for example, varies from 6 h in winter to 18 h in summer. As phytoplankton photosynthesis is largely determined by the available sun illumination, it is reasonable that seasonality of pCO2 aligns with that of PAR. In addition, river discharge loaded with CDOM, etc. is also characterized with high seasonality and, to large extent, synchronized to PAR [30], so is the bacteria respiration dependent on the available organic matter. Therefore, it is reasonable that PAR exhibited high importance for sea surface pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea and its sub-basins. The importance of PAR in the pCO2 estimate in the Baltic Sea in different seasons can be attributed to the wide span of the Baltic Sea (12°) in latitude (Figure 1) and the resultant large gradient in sun illumination. On a day in spring, the sun illumination in the southern Baltic Sea is 2–3 h longer than that in the north, same for fall. The gradients in PAR largely impose differences in the intensities of phytoplankton photosynthesis, SST distribution, and ultimately to CO2 uptake of sea water via primary production. As for in summer when PAR and other variables displayed similar but low importance, sun illumination in the northern Baltic Sea is up to 6 h longer than in the southern Baltic Sea, displaying an even larger spatial gradient across the Baltic Sea than in other seasons. However, owing to snowmelt, the co-current freshwater discharge and the nutrients it loads are all very high in the Baltic Sea in late spring and early summer [30], create a high spatiality in the nutrient and DOM etc. Yet, the spatial pattern of cDOM etc. are likely different from that of PAR, depending on the sizes of catchment and land cover types. When all the processes determining pCO2 take place with similarly high intensities, none of the variables exhibit prominent importance, but all of them jointly determined the pCO2 in the Baltic Sea in summertime with similar degree (importance).Concerning the determination of the seasonality in sea surface pCO2, the Julian day of the year (DOY) has been frequently in previous studies [12,16]. However, in this study, PAR holds two advantages over DOY. Firstly, PAR is a direct measure of sun radiation available for photosynthesis, and it has physical meaning, while DOY is a proxy of the seasonality. Secondly, a trigonometric conversion is often applied on DOY to correctly proximate the seasonality. Specifically, the minus cosine of DOY was used for pCO2 estimate in waters in the northern hemisphere and cosine of DOY for waters in the southern hemisphere [16,18]. Consequently, a trigonometric conversion of DOY attributes a spatially constant value in the entire hemisphere and overlook the effect spatial gradient of sun illumination. In contrast, PAR captures well the spatial gradient of sun illumination along the longitude and express its effect on photosynthesis in the water. Therefore, we suggest that future sea surface pCO2 estimation consider the participation of PAR instead of DOY (Figure 1).The SST holds the same position in the pattern of variables’ importance for pCO2 estimate in the Baltic Sea and its sub-basin (Figure 2). This was probably because the seasonality magnitudes of SST in each sub-basin are on the same order, particularly when the sub-basins are relatively small and well mixed horizontally. In many cases, despite its correlation to pCO2 being on the same order as the Chl-a-pCO2 and Kd_490nm-pCO2 correlations, SST showed a larger importance than Chl-a, which aligned with the prediction error produced by alternatively omitting the variables by [17]. In the pCO2 estimates for the Baltic Sea in different seasons, SST was more important in August–October than in other seasons (Figure 3). This was probably because, in fall, the large spatial gradient in SST in the Baltic Sea responded more to the pCO2 distribution at a similar degree as the PAR does, but more than other variables. For example, the sea surface in the Gulf of Bothnia starts freezing already in October and lower down the primary production, whereas the southern Baltic Sea remains open water at time and allow the biological CO2 uptake [77].Despite its low importance for the pCO2 estimate for the entire Baltic Sea, aCDOM exhibited more important for the pCO2 estimate in the Gulf of Finland than in other sub-basins (Figure 2B). The aCDOM -pCO2 correlation in the Baltic Sea is also relatively large, particularly at the coast and in the Gulf of Finland (Figure 7). As mentioned previously, bacteria respiration produces CO2 by decomposing organic carbons, like DOM [14,15]. The relatively narrow waters of the Gulf of Finland receive a large terrestrial input of DOM from the rivers, including the Neva, which drains the largest sub-catchment of the Baltic Sea, approximately 1/6 of the total Baltic Sea catchment [30]. The changes of sea surface pCO2 in the Gulf of Finland largely responded to the changes in CDOM there. Therefore, aCDOM is important for pCO2 estimation in the Gulf of Finland (Figure 2B) and thus in the Baltic Sea, as well. Similar mechanism very likely applies at coastal waters receiving river discharges. Moreover, this study used the aCDOM derived from MERIS images. The MERIS sensor was succeeded by the Ocean and Land Color Instrument (OLCI) sensors on Sentinel-3 satellites in 2016. Therefore, aCDOM derived from OLCI images will likely play an equivalent role in the pCO2 estimate in the Baltic Sea and other similar waters.Though less than PAR and sometimes slightly less than SST, MLD was important for the pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea and all its sub-basins (Figure 2B). pCO2 in the Baltic Sea is largely and positively correlated to MLD (Figure 7). This is probably resulted from the seasonally varying amount of fresh water discharged by the many rivers and lay above the relatively saline and heavy water [78]. In addition, seasonal winds in the Baltic Sea might have jointly determined the high variation of MLD [32] and, consequently, the vertical mixing of sea water and pCO2, as well.In this study, Kd_490 nm showed low importance to the pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea, regardless of season or sub-basin (Figure 2 and Figure 3) and a relatively weaker correlations to pCO2 (i.e., from −0.7 to 0), compared to variables, like PAR and aCDOM. This aligns with the previously found negatively correlation between Kd_490 nm and pCO2 in the Gulf of Mexico [16]. Here, we argue that the reasons behind the low contribution of Chl-a to pCO2 estimation very likely also applied to Kd_490nm. This argument is well supported by previous studies. It is found that Kd_490nm in the Baltic Sea was a function of inherent optical properties, i.e., absorption and scattering of phytoplankton, and effects of illumination and viewing angle [79,80]. Furthermore, [81] observed a strong positive correlation between Kd_490nm and river discharge into the Baltic Sea and the latter is rich of CDOM. In addition, a positive correlation of Kd_490nm to Chl-a and aCDOM were noticed in the Baltic Sea (S9), and the Kd_490nm-pCO2 and aCDOM-pCO2 correlations also exhibited similar patterns (Figure 7).", 6. Discussion, 6.1. Characteristics of Variable Contribution to the pCO2 Estimate,6
602,"The in-situ pCO2 measurements available in the Baltic Sea during 2002–2011 were unevenly distributed, namely, relatively sparse measurements in the north and dense measurements in the south (Figure 1). In order to ensure the participation of the in-situ data from the northern Baltic Sea, we selected in-situ data month-wise to train and validate the model for pCO2 estimation, instead of randomly selecting from the in-situ measurements. However, this measure led to the missing determination of variables’ importance for the Gulf of Bothnia due to the few months of in-situ measurements in this basin (i.e., March 2006 and September 2009). In the future, including additional in-situ pCO2 measurements from the Gulf of Bothnia can help analyze the variables’ importance for the pCO2 estimate in that region and understand the processes controlling pCO2 there. These additional in-situ pCO2 measurements are also expected to improve the RMSE of pCO2 estimate for the entire Baltic Sea.Despite the unbalanced distribution of in-situ data in the Baltic Sea, the monthly pCO2 maps were retrieved for the Baltic Sea for the period of August–October 2011 (Figure 5). The RMSE of the model for pCO2 estimation was 47.8 µatm (Figure 4), slightly larger than 25 µatm and 31.7 µatm, the RMSEs of the models constructed by [16] and [17], respectively, for pCO2 estimation in the Gulf of Mexico using similar tree-based regression algorithms. Still, the RMSE of 47.8 µatm is relatively small for pCO2 estimation in the Baltic Sea, considering the following factors: (1) the pCO2 estimation was undertaken on the monthly frequency, where the in-situ data from entire month was integrated to the few days with remote sensing images; (2) The magnitudes of the seasonal changes in pCO2 in the Baltic Sea are much larger than that in middle or low latitude marginal seas. For example, the pCO2 in the Baltic Sea was in the range of 100–600 µatm (Figure 8), while, in the Gulf of Mexico, it was 200–450 µatm [16], and, in the South China Sea, it was 250–450 µatm [11]; (3). The processes controlling pCO2 across the Baltic sea (e.g., phytoplankton photosynthesis, bacteria respiration and runoff) vary spatially and temporally [30,82] and thus increase the difficulties in mapping pCO2 in the Baltic Sea with high accuracy; (4) Upwelling take places in the Baltic Sea with varying frequencies among years and months [83] and complicates the pCO2 process in multiple manners [34,84]. Even though we eliminated the months dominated by upwelling, few upwelling might have remained in the rest of the months and increased the RMSE of the model; (5) Most importantly, the random forest model covered the processes that took places in the entire Baltic Sea in all the seasons in the period of 2002–2011. This task itself is a challenging one due to the above factors. All these factors rendered deriving sea surface pCO2 in the Baltic Sea more challenging than in other marginal seas.The random forest algorithm outperformed SOM and MLR in the sea surface pCO2 estimation (Figure 8). We attributed this to how the three algorithms treated the variables. In random forest, a series of forests were constructed, and the most effective one was chosen for prediction [59,65]. While the variables and training samples were randomly selected for the tree construction, the best model was the one with little participation of the unimportant variables. In contrast, when the mode was constructed with SOM, all the input variables had the same weights [70]. This very likely amplified the contribution of the unimportant or correlated variables and suppresses the important ones at the corresponding temporal and spatial scale, thus caused misestimates (Figure 8A,C). The variants of SOM, such as SOMLO, probably also inherit such effects. MLR attributed weights to the input variables by determining their correlation coefficients to the dependent variables. The effect of the coefficients is very evident in the case when the training samples were chosen across months and cover a large variation. For example, in the experiments in Figure 8A–C, the samples covered 2/3 of the months and performed RMSE similar to that of random forest and better than SOM. In contrast, in the experiment where the samples were 2/3 of the entire in-situ data set from random selection, samples from the same season/months of high similarity were likely used. Given that the time window of in-situ data was narrowed down to 9:00–14:00, and the in-situ data from the months dominated by upwelling were also removed, we did not consider the effect of outlier on the modeling and the errors produced by the models were regarded to be from the misestimate of the models. Overall, random forest performs better than MLR and SOM regardless of the variation range of the training data. MLR performs better than SOM when the training data cover a large variation, and SOM performs better than MLR when the training data cover a relatively small variation.", 6. Discussion, 6.2. Impact of Unbalanced In-Situ Measurements Distribution on the Model for pCO2 Estimate,6
603,"In this study, we produced the monthly pCO2 maps for the entire Baltic Sea over the period of August 2002–October 2020. These maps showed that pCO2 across the Baltic Sea was characterized by strong seasonality, generally, high pCO2 in winter and low pCO2 in summer (Figure 5 and Figure 6). The trend aligned well with that derived from in-situ data in the Baltic Sea [85]. The seasonality of pCO2 in the Baltic Sea was similar to that in the marginal sea of Gulf of Maine but different from the one observed in Gulf of Mexico by [16]. In addition, the range of seasonal pCO2 variation in the Baltic Sea (i.e., 100–500 µatm) was larger than that observed for the two marginal seas (i.e., 300–500 µatm) (Figure 5 and Figure 6) [16]. These different seasonal variations trends and variables’ importance (e.g., Kd_490nm) suggest that the processes determining the pCO2 in the Baltic Sea are likely different from that observed in other seas, or same processes work on different intensity, for example, the gradient in PAR.In addition to the similar seasonal trend, minor differences exist in the seasonal trends of pCO2 in the Baltic Sea. For example, Baltic Proper and the Gulf of Finland showed pCO2 minima both in May and July, while, in the Bothnia Bay and Bothnia Sea, it was only shown on minima in June (Figure 6). May is the time when most rivers pass their annual peak of water levels [30], and, in July, the daytime is the longest in a year in Baltic Sea, with the most sunny days. In addition, different areas in the Baltic Sea showed interannual variations in different months (Figure 6). For example, the waters in the Gulf of Finland exhibited large interannual variation in April (Figure 6D), when the large river input take place in the sub-basin [27]. The Baltic Proper showed such variations during May–July (Figure 6E), when the primary production is high in this sub-basin and upwelling also occurs very often there [58,68]. This indicates that the dominantly driver of pCO2 are spatially variable across the Baltic Sea. The pCO2 maps derived from this model exhibited continuous transitions between the sub-basins of the Baltic Sea (Figure 5). Therefore, these maps are a significant improvement from those produced in previous studied by dividing the Baltic sea into different sub-basins [12].", 6. Discussion, 6.3. pCO2 Maps for the Baltic Sea and Its Spatiotemporal Characteristics,6
604,"This study analyzed the variables’ importance in the pCO2 estimation for the Baltic Sea across different time and sub-basins with the support of remote sensing and derived pCO2 maps for the Baltic Sea from August 2002 to October 2011. We found that the contributions of the variables to pCO2 retrieval for the Baltic Sea vary both spatially and temporally and likely replicated the spatiotemporal characteristics of the driving forces. Among all the variables, PAR was the most important, followed by SST and MLD. Chl-a contributed surprisingly little to the pCO2 estimate. aCDOM was important for the pCO2 estimation for the Gulf of Finland and the Gulf of Riga. The random forest model used for the pCO2 estimate for the entire Baltic Sea had the RMSE of 47.8 µatm, MAE of −3.26 µatm, and coefficient of determination of 0.63. These pCO2 maps derived in this study are one of the most reliable pCO2 fields in the Baltic Sea and can potentially support determining the role of the Baltic Sea as sink/source of the atmospheric CO2. Moreover, the variables importance/relevance from this study can provide a benchmark for understanding the different drivers of pCO2 in the Baltic Sea and how they vary in different time and space.In the Baltic Sea region, frequent clouds in November, December, and January lead to the absence of pCO2 maps during those three months. This is an inevitable situation considering the high-latitude location of the Baltic Sea. Derivation of sea surface pCO2 for the Baltic Sea in the wintertime needs to be achieved by combining the remote sensing supported results with additional sources information, e.g., modeling.", 7.

605,"High-value timber species play important ecological and economic roles in forest management [1,2]. Trees with high economic value are often large in size [3] contributing to structural heterogeneity, dynamics, and functions of the forest ecosystem [4,5], and make up a large fraction of aboveground biomass [6]. They play an important role in the rate and pattern of regeneration and forest succession [7] and provide habitats for wildlife species [8]. Because of their high commercial value, high-value timber species are subjected to excessive and illegal harvesting [9,10]. In many regions of the world, their numbers are declining [11] and therefore, species of high-value timber trees have often been earmarked for special attention in conservation and forest management practices [12]. Due to their economic and ecological importance in forest management, the single-tree management of high-value timber species was recommended in previous studies [3,11]. Single tree selection, measuring and periodic monitoring for the optimal management of these species are important elements under single-tree management.For management and conservation purposes, the forest inventory needs to provide accurate information of high-value individuals such as tree height and diameter at breast height (DBH). The individual tree DBH can be measured accurately by traditional field measurements, but tree height is relatively difficult to measure accurately [13]. Further, the results of tree height measurements are greatly influenced by many factors including biophysical and topographic factors, instrument errors, and human errors [14,15,16,17]. Although errors are likely to be presented in the field measurements of tree height than other parameters, such as DBH [15,18], field-measured tree heights have been widely understood to be the most reliable source of tree height information [19].With the advancement of remote sensing (RS) technology such as airborne laser scanning (ALS) and digital aerial photographs derived from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-DAP), the use of RS technology may overcome difficulty in accurate tree height measurement in the field. ALS is an active remote sensing technique that uses a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor, which enables us to measure the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of vegetation canopy components as well as sub-canopy topography, resulting in an accurate estimation of vegetation height and ground elevation [20,21]. Many previous studies have demonstrated the ability of LiDAR data in the estimation of forest information over large areas of forests with high accuracy [22,23,24]. Further, a LiDAR 3D forest structure can provide accurate individual tree height information [25,26,27,28,29]. However, the major limitation of LiDAR data is the high acquisition cost, which limits its application in forest management directives [30,31]. Recently UAV-DAP has become a popular RS technique for fine-scale remote sensing due to its flexibility in data acquisition, low operational cost, and high spatial and temporal resolution [32]. Software developments, such as Structure-from-Motion (SfM), offer the efficient processing of digital aerial photographs (DAPs) acquired from low-cost UAV platforms, providing an cost-effective alternative to generate the 3D forest information, i.e., photogrammetric point cloud (PPC) [33,34,35]. Although PPC fails to provide ground information especially in dense vegetation cover, it can provide an upper canopy surface [36,37]. Thus, the accurate digital terrain model (DTM) is a prerequisite for the accurate characterization of forest information using PPC. Where highly accurate DTM exists, PPC has been proven to provide a cost-effective estimation of forest information with high accuracy comparable to LiDAR data [38,39,40,41,42,43,44]. Moreover, recent studies suggested that UAV-DAP could provide highly accurate individual tree height information [45,46,47,48]. However, most of these studies have been employed in forests with simple structural complexity such as plantations or even-aged forests. Applications of UAV-DAP for individual tree height measurement, particularly for large-size broadleaf trees, have not been widely studied, especially in structurally complex mixed forests. Moreover, a rigorous comparison of individual tree height estimation between LiDAR, UAV-DAP and field survey data is rare. Therefore, we tried to address these issues in this study.In cool-temperate mixed forests in northern Japan, monarch birch is the most valuable timber species, with the log price reaching 20,000 USD per cubic meter, and castor aralia is the second most expensive timber species, with its prices reaching 7500 USD per cubic meter [3]. Japanese oak, is another valuable broadleaved timber species; its timber supply is exclusively dependent on the cutting of large trees within mixed forests [49]. Accurate individual tree information of these high-value timber species is important for the reliable application of single-tree management system [2,3]. However, tree height estimation for these species is a challenging task for forest managers.The aim of the present study is, therefore, to examine whether UAV-DAP could be used to derive the height of large-size high-value trees. First, we compare individual tree height derived from field survey, LiDAR, and UAV-DAP data. Since tree height can be predicted from the individual tree DBH (e.g., [50,51,52]), secondly, we assess the relationship between individual tree DBH and the tree height derived from field survey, LiDAR, and UAV-DAP through height-diameter models to examine how three height sources can be explained by tree diameter.

606,"This study was conducted in the University of Tokyo Hokkaido Forest (UTHF) (Figure 1). UTHF is located in Furano City, central Hokkaido Island in northern Japan (43°10–20′ N, 142°18–40′ E, 190–1459 m asl). UTHF is a pan-mixed forest, where uneven-aged mixed forests with coniferous and broad-leaved tree species are the main vegetation cover. The mean annual temperature was 6.4 °C and precipitation was 1297 mm at the arboretum of the UTHF (230 m asl) during 2001‒2010, and snow usually covers the ground from late November to early April with a maximum depth of approximately 1 m. The predominant tree species included Sakhalin fir (Abies sachalinensis), Yezo spruce (Picea jezoensis), Japanese linden (Tilia japonica), and painted maple (Acer pictum var. mono) [53]. Other common conifer tree species include Taxus cuspidata, Picea glehnii. B. maximowicziana, K. septemlobus, Q. crispula, and Ulmus laciniata, which are among the common deciduous broadleaved species. For this study, two forest management sub-compartments - compartment 36B and compartment 59A—were selected. Compartment 36B is scheduled for management activities in 2020 and compartment 59A was managed in 2019. Major management activities included selection harvesting except in reserved forest areas. Harvesting rates were determined based on the forest inventory practices one year ahead of management activities. ", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.1. Study Site,2

Measurement parameters included the DBH, tree height, and spatial positions of individual trees. A summary of field measurement is given in Table 1. DBH was measured using diameter tape. The tree heights were measured using a Vertex III hypsometer and transponder (Haglöf, Sweden AB). Tree height measurements were carried out three times, and average height values were assumed as the corresponding tree height. Individual tree spatial positions were recorded using global navigation satellite system (GNSS). We used an R2 integrated GNSS system (Trimble, USA) to record individual tree spatial positions with an accuracy of less than 1 m.  2.2.2.

The detail specifications of LiDAR data are summarized in Table 2. The acquired data included first, second, third and last return and waveform data. The classification of LiDAR data into ground and non-ground points was initially processed by the data provider (Hokkaido Aero Asahi, Hokkaido, Japan), and data were delivered in LAS format. In this study, we used first and last return data only.  2.2.3. UAV DataUAV imagery was acquired on 8 and 10 July 2019 for compartment 36B and 11 and 30 July 2019 for compartment 59A. We used an Inspire-2 platform mounted with a Zenmuse X5S RGB camera (DJI, Shenzhen, China) for image acquisition. Eight separate flights for compartment 36B and 10 separate flights for compartment 59A were employed. In both compartments, the flying altitudes were set to 120 m, but the actual flying height may have varied because of the terrain conditions. The average ground sampling distances were 2.3 cm/pixel.

611," 2.3.1. LiDAR Data Processing and LiDAR-CHM GenerationFor this study, LiDAR data processing was performed using US Forest Service FUSION/LDV 3.8.0 software [54]. LiDAR digital terrain models (LiDAR-DTM) of 0.5 m spatial resolution were generated using GroundFilter and GridSurfaceCreate functions. LiDAR point clouds were normalized to the height above ground by the subtraction of the LiDAR-DTM elevation from LiDAR digital surface models (LiDAR-DSM) to generate the LiDAR canopy height model (LiDAR-CHM). We used the CanopyModel function in FUSION/LDV software to generate a LiDAR-CHM with a 0.5 m spatial resolution.  2.3.2. UAV Data Processing and UAV-DAP-CHM GenerationWe used the 3D modelling software Agisoft Metashape Professional Edition 1.5.3 (Agisoft, St. Petersburg, Russia) for UAV photogrammetric processing. Metashape offers a user-friendly workflow that combines proprietary algorithms based on computer vision SfM and stereo-matching for image alignment and reconstruction of the 3D image [35]. The workflow included four stages: image alignment, building a dense point cloud, building a digital elevation model (DEM) and building an orthomosaic. During the image alignment stage, the stage at which camera location, orientation and other internal parameters are optimized [55], we used high accuracy for image matching. Using the SfM techniques, this stage extract features within the images and match those features to pair the images. This stage produced a sparse 3D point cloud. After initial alignment, we deleted many abnormal points based on gradual selection procedures in Metashape [55] to optimize the camera locations. We then added GCPs in each corresponding image for a more accurate optimization of camera locations and orientation as well as other internal camera parameters. In the building dense point cloud stage, the stage that generates a dense point clouds, we used medium quality to reduce the image processing time and mild depth filtering to remove the outliers. We followed the Metashape default setting for the DEM building stage and orthomosaic building stage. Dense point clouds were exported in LAS format with average point density of 547.01 points/m2. and orthophotographs with a 3 cm pixel resolution were exported in GeoTiff format.Previous studies [37,40,42] highlighted the need for accurate DTM for the normalization of DAP point clouds.

614,"In order to evaluate the reliability of individual tree height measurement using different data sources—i.e., field, LiDAR and UAV-DAP—exact individual trees need to be identified in all three data sources. Further, methods of measuring tree height need to be carried out separately to ensure independent measurements from the statistical point of view. An individual tree crown detection algorithm may impose errors in detecting individual trees and previous studies reported poor results in tree detection under a complex forest structure [23,56]. Therefore, field measured individual tree positions were used to identify the exact trees on both CHMs with the help of UAV-DAP orthophotographs. The manual delineation of an individual tree crown was carried out using high resolution orthophotographs. These crown polygons were used as reference crowns and for extracting individual tree heights from both LiDAR-CHM and UAV-DAP-CHM. In forestry, tree height can be defined as the vertical distance between the ground level and tip of the tree [57]. We also used this definition in measuring tree height in the field. According to this definition, the difference between maximum point within a crown and the ground is the tree height. Therefore, the maximum value within a manually delineated crown polygon was considered to be the corresponding tree height. Height measurements were carried out separately for LiDAR-CHM and UAV-DAP-CHM. It should be noted that there is a temporal discrepancy of 10 to 11 months between the LiDAR data acquisition and UAV imagery acquisition. Field measurements were carried out at the same time as UAV imagery acquisition. Previous studies suggested that trees typically invest heavily in height growth when young, rapidly approaching their maximum height, but then continue to grow in diameter throughout their lives [58]. In our data, only large diameter trees (DBH > 40 cm) were included (Table 1). Therefore, we assumed that there are no large increments in the tree heights of large size trees.", 2.

Individual Tree Height ComparisonThe individual tree height comparison was carried out in pairs; i.e., Field height vs. LiDAR height, Field height vs. UAV-DAP height, and LiDAR height vs. UAV-DAP height. To access the degree of association between pairs, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient (r). Further, we calculated the root mean square difference (RMSD). The RMSD indicates the average height difference between measurement methods and clarifies the magnitude of the differences between measurement methods. Further we calculated the mean difference (MD) to indicate whether tree heights derived from one measurement technique were generally greater or smaller than those derived from another measurement technique.  2.5.2. Height-Diameter RelationshipsTree height-diameter (H-D) models are widely used to predict individual tree heights (e.g., [51,52,59]). Tree height data predicted from DBH using these models can be used as an input variable in various forest models such as growth and yield models, and biomass models [15,24]. Most of the previously published studies used one tree height measurement technique, i.e., field survey, in H-D models. As UAV-DAP and LiDAR data could provide accurate tree height information, it is worth to examine how different tree height data sources may provide improved H-D models. To assess the performance of different tree height measuring techniques in the H-D model, we tested a simple non-linear function (Equation (1)) which was widely used in the height-diameter allometric models:

623,"In this study, we demonstrated the ability of UAV-DAP to perform the individual tree height estimation of high-value timber individuals in mixed conifer-broadleaf forests in northern Japan. We observed that UAV-DAP enabled individual tree height estimation with comparable accuracy to airborne laser scanning or LiDAR data and field-measured data. According to Table 4, stronger correlation coefficients were observed in LiDAR and UAV-DAP tree height comparison among three pairs of comparison. LiDAR derived tree height showed better correlation with field measure tree height than UAV-DAP derived tree height. This result is consistent with a previous study by Wallace et al. [44]. They also reported a stronger correlation between Field vs. LiDAR than Field vs. UAV-DAP. However, the correlation between LiDAR and field measured tree height in this study was lower than other studies [25,27,28,29]. This lower correlation could be related to the species, the tree height itself and measurement errors in the field. In addition, the accuracy of tree heights derived from RS data might also be influenced by many factors such as structural complexity of the forest canopy which could affect photogrammetric reconstruction [44,61,62]. Moreover, LiDAR data also have limitations such as tree height estimation errors due to different canopy height model generation methods [63], susceptibility to influence of slope and crown shape on canopy height [64]. One of the key questions when using field-measured tree height as reference data for the evaluation of LiDAR or UAV-DAP is the accuracy of field measurement. Sibona et al. [29] assessed the accuracy of LiDAR tree height using actual tree height derived from 100 felled trees. They found that tree height derived from LiDAR data was closer to actual height than field measurement. Since our target species are large-size high-value broadleaved trees, some error in field measurement could be expected because of the tree height itself and tree crowns which limit the visibility to the tree tops. This was also highlighted by Hunter et al. [15] and Stereńczak et al. [17]. These studies reported that small measurement errors were found in conifer species and larger trees were subjected more to height measurement errors in the field. Further, the number of leaves present in our study species may impact the accuracy of field tree height measurement. Huang et al. [48] also highlighted that the effect of number of leaves in the canopy may affect the tree height estimation for deciduous trees. For all three high-value broadleaved species, the highest correlation and consistency was observed between UAV-DAP tree height and LiDAR tree height. Using the area-based approach, previous studies comparing the performance of UAV-DAP and LiDAR data also reported the high correlation and accuracy in forest attribute estimation such as mean height, and dominant height (e.g., [38,39,41,61]). Among the three broadleaved species, castor aralia showed a higher correlation than the other two species in all three pairs of comparison. The crown of castor aralia is somewhat rounded and regular in shape, which makes it easier for the surveyor to detect the tree tops from the ground during the field measurement than other two species. The size and shape of monarch birch crown are highly irregular. Moreover, the maximum size of field measured trees of Japanese oak was 110 cm in DBH with an average DBH larger than other two species. The older and larger oak tree crowns may produce extensive crowns, causing difficulty in determining the position of the highest point of the oak trees. This could contribute to some errors in estimating tree height using height measuring instruments. Larjavaara and Muller-Landau [16] also reported that, under typical forest conditions with limited visibility to the tree tops, tree height measurement instruments cannot produce manufacturer-reported accuracies.Positive height differences were observed for higher trees and negative height differences were found for lower height trees between field and RS-derived tree height (Figure 4), meaning field measured tree height overestimated the tree height of higher trees and underestimated the height of lower trees. This result is consistent with previous studies. For example, Hunter et al. [15] in their study in the Brazilian Amazon reported that ground-based measurements of tree heights of emergent crowns exceeded LiDAR-measured tree heights by an average of 1.4 m. Moreover Laurin et al. [13] and Wang et al. [28] reported that traditional field measurement techniques may overestimate the tree height of tall trees. Imai et al. [26] also concluded in their study in Japan that LiDAR data tend to estimate the tree height as lower than the actual height. In terms of LiDAR and UAV-DAP tree height differences; there was a positive height difference in lower trees and negative height difference in higher trees. Tree height differences between LiDAR and UAV-DAP varied with species. The largest height difference was found for monarch birch (-2.74 m and 4.00 m). A previous study in a mixed conifer-broadleaf forest in northern Japan [61] reported that the mean differences between LiDAR-CHM and UAV-DAP-CHM in terms of the maximum tree heights of the sample plots were 2.96 m and 1.05 m in two study compartments. However, higher mean height differences were found in UAV-DAP data [61].The applicability of tree height information derived from UAV-DAP was analysed using the height-diameter model for each species since tree diameter play significant role in predicting the tree height. UAV-DAP derived tree height can be explained by tree diameter with high accuracy compare to LiDAR and field measured tree height (Table 7, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8). Mean prediction errors of the tested height-diameter models also revealed the lowest errors for LiDAR and UAV-DAP derived tree height in all height class. In Figure 7, highest negative mean prediction errors were found for castor aralia which may be due to the unequal high distribution of field measured tree of castor aralia trees with minimum height values of 14.1 m which could affect the model performance. For all species, higher prediction errors were observed for field measure tree height. This can also be confirmed by the larger RMSE values of field measured tree height. Although there is not sufficient evidence in the existing literature for these results, the tree height of large-size high-value trees derived from LiDAR and UAV-DAP can be explained better by the tree diameter than field-measured height. Therefore, this study confirmed the applicability of the UAV-DAP for tree height estimation of large-size high-value trees and its potential for estimating tree diameter. The use of UAV-DAP could facilitate the periodic monitoring and assessment of high-value timber species. ", 4. Discussion,None,4
624,"Our study demonstrates the applicability of UAV-DAP for individual tree height estimation of large-size high-value timber species in mixed conifer-broadleaf forests in northern Japan. We compared the tree heights derived from field survey, LiDAR data and UAV-DAP data through statistical analysis and height-diameter models. The results revealed the high similarity between three different height sources. Lower tree height values for higher trees and higher values for lower trees may occur in UAV-DAP derived tree height in comparison with field-based measurement. Although overall mean tree height difference between LiDAR and UAV-DAP data indicates that UAV-DAP could underestimate the tree height, it is likely to observe higher tree height values for higher trees and lower tree height values for lower trees in UAV-DAP derived tree height when comparing with LiDAR derived tree height for our study species. In addition, the height-diameter models revealed that tree height derived from UAV-DAP can be explained by tree DBH with comparable accuracy to LiDAR and field measured tree height. Smaller mean prediction errors across RS-derived tree height classes were observed in comparison with field measured tree height confirming the high accuracy of UAV-DAP which can facilitate tree height estimation of high-value timber species. Our focus in this study only includes high-value broadleaf species. As this study demonstrated the applicability of UAV-DAP for tree height estimation, it would be better to further examine other species so that it can use in the periodic monitoring of permanent sample plots in the study area. Further research should also focus on how UAV-DAP in combination with LiDAR data would be useful for species-specific or single-tree management planning by accurately locating the spatial position and stem size of high-value tree individuals.", 5.

625,"As the dominant terrestrial ecosystem on earth, forests occupy approximately 30% of the land surface area and contribute to 75% of land gross primary production [1,2]. Subtropical forests have high diversity, dense carbon and complex structure, and cover approximately one quarter of China’s total area. They provide valuable ecosystem goods and services to humanity and play a key role in the mitigation of climate change [3,4]. Forest structures, shaped by silvicultural practices and natural events, provide considerable information about ecosystem values such as biodiversity, water conservation and erosion control [5]. Forest structural parameters (e.g., diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), tree density (N), basal area (G), etc.) are essential for the parameterization of forest growth models and understanding forest ecosystems [6,7]. Timely, accurate and reliable acquisition of forest structural parameters across large areas is crucial for sustainable and multifunctional forest management [8]. Traditionally, forest structural parameters were collected using field inventory, which is labor intensive and time-consuming [9,10]. Remote sensing technology is able to provide detailed continuous-spatial, multi-dimensional and massive-spectral information, allowing for precise forest structural parameter prediction based on their structural and spectral signatures [11,12,13]. Remote sensing data have advantages such as spatial information quantification, high geometric precision and vast geographic coverage [14,15], and have been used in the prediction of forest structural parameters over a range of forest types [16,17,18].Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been applied as a promising technology for predicting forest structural parameters due to its capability to provide three-dimensional information about forest structures with high accuracy [19,20,21]. Airborne discrete-return LiDAR systems record multiple return signals, which contain the three-dimensional position and intensity of reflected light from each transmitted pulse. The metrics extracted from discrete point clouds represent the vertical structural characteristics of canopy such as height measures, Weibull distribution parameters, and classes of crown volume zones, etc., which can be used to predict forest structural parameters [22,23,24]. Forest structural parameters, i.e., H, G, V and AGB, have been predicted using discrete point cloud data in previous studies [21,22,24,25]. However, discrete-return systems record limited information in each returned signal, and can only detect the surfaces which are separated sufficiently in space [26]. Airborne full-waveform (FWF) LiDAR systems record the whole backscattered returns, thus they can record the geometric and biophysical attributes of forests [27]. The point cloud can be derived from FWF LiDAR data, and the number of returns extracted from FWF data is much higher than that from discrete point cloud data [28]. The waveforms obtained by full-waveform systems depend on many factors such as target backscattering characteristics, LiDAR sensor types, scan geometry [29], etc. In order to make pulse amplitude possible to be used as its true value, the pulse amplitude needs to be calibrated and corrected in full-waveform data processing [30,31]. Owing to the waveform recorded by full-waveform system being stretched by the increases of off-nadir angle and the waveforms from different trajectories often being non-vertical, the waveform processing approach needs to be developed to synthesize the raw waveforms in multiple directions into composite vertical waveforms. The full-waveform metrics (FW) extracted from FWF data describe the canopy response using parameters of waveform shape and can be applied in the prediction of forest structural parameters [13,32]. Lindberg et al. [33] extracted the amplitude of waveforms in height intervals to predict the volume in hemi-boreal forest in the southwest of Sweden, and found that the predictive model of total volume had high accuracy for waveform data (relative RMSE = 31.9%). In the prediction of forest structural parameters (e.g., DBH, H, N and AGB, etc.), the accuracies of predictive models were improved when using full-waveform metrics [34,35].Hyperspectral data offer large amounts of continuous-narrow bands which contain detailed spectral signatures associated with forest biophysical properties, and which can be applied to predict forest structural parameters [16,36,37]. Airborne hyperspectral data usually have finer spatial resolution than space-borne data because airborne platforms commonly having lower altitudes than space-borne platforms [38,39]. Previous studies have demonstrated that airborne hyperspectral data perform well in forest tree species classification [40,41], and structural parameters prediction, e.g., DBH [42], tree height [43], basal area [44], stem density [23] and biomass [44,45,46]. The visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) regions of hyperspectral narrow bands are usually considered to be correlated with forest structure properties [39,47]. Latifi et al. [23] found that a number of atmospheric window bands in the domains of VIS and NIR such as 540 nm, 680–730 nm and 970 nm were the most important and stable predictors of forest stem density and biomass. The hyperspectral narrow band metrics, formulated using the bands in VIS and NIR domains, rely on the pigments (e.g., chlorophyll, carotene and anthocyanin, etc.), structure and physiology of tree canopy and have great potential in the prediction of forest structural parameters [48,49]. Particularly, using hyperspectral narrow band metrics can relatively weaken the influences of soil background reflectance, illumination and atmospheric absorption [17,50]. The vegetation indices are the most commonly used narrow band metrics in the prediction of forest structural parameters [37,51,52]. The vegetation indices such as the soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI), and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are considered to be correlated with N, G, V and AGB [23,53]. Zhang et al. [54] used HJ-1 hyperspectral data to predict forest AGB in a subtropical forest and found that SAVI is strongly related to the AGB (r = 0.91). Nevertheless, in a densely forest area, the hyperspectral data metrics are prone to asymptotically reach a saturation level [55]. Moreover, since the hyperspectral data usually provide horizontal information, it has certain limitations in quantifying the vertical structure of forests [56]. These limitations can influence the accuracy of predictions of forest structural parameters.An integration of airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data is expected to provide more information on the prediction of forest structural parameters. However, few studies have attempted to improve forest structural parameters predictions by integrating airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data. Dalponte et al. [42] integrated airborne discrete point cloud LiDAR and hyperspectral data to predict stem diameter and volume in a temperate forest and found that the improvement in accuracies of stem diameter and volume were 0.4% and 0.5%, respectively. Luo et al. [57] integrated airborne discrete point cloud LiDAR and hyperspectral data to estimate AGB in a northern temperate deciduous forest. The results indicated that by using integrated discrete point cloud LiDAR and hyperspectral data, 2.2% more of the variability in AGB was explained. In previous studies, most have only focused on the prediction of forest biomass by integrating discrete-return LiDAR and hyperspectral data in temperate and boreal forests. Since the acquisition modalities and structures of FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral data are disparate, it is difficult to integrate FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral data at the raw data level [58]. The integration commonly includes transforming FWF LiDAR data into two-dimensional images and adding suites of hyperspectral metrics or the information of tree-species derived from hyperspectral data into FWF data [23,32,53].However, the predictions of forest structural parameters have been mainly implemented in temperate and boreal forests, and there are few published studies from subtropical forest. Moreover, few studies have used radiometrically and geometrically calibrated FWF LiDAR data in analysis, therefore, the synergetic effects of FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral data could be influenced by the target backscattering characteristics and scan geometry. In addition, previous studies did not comprehensively extract and optimize suites of FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics, and the relativities and synergetic effects of point cloud, full-waveform and hyperspectral metrics have not been fully explored in the prediction of forest structural parameters. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has integrated simultaneously acquired airborne FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral data to predict forest structural parameters in subtropical forests. The objectives of this paper are: (1) to calibrate the airborne FWF LiDAR data by the physical process-driven and voxel-based models; (2) to integrate and assess the synergetic effects of FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral data-derived metrics for predicting forest structural parameters in subtropical forests; and (3) to validate the predictive models fitted by DPC, FW and HS individually, and in combination using field measured data and to analyze the residuals of the prediction.", 1.

626,"The nearly 1103 ha study area is located in the Yushan forest (120°42′9.4″ E, 31°40′4.1″ N), situated in the southern Jiangsu provinces, southeast China (Figure 2). The annual mean temperature and precipitation are 15.6 °C and 1062.5 mm, respectively. The elevation of the Yushan forest ranges from 20 to 261 m above sea-level. The Yushan forest is north subtropical secondary forest and has three types of forests: coniferous tree species dominated, broadleaved tree species dominated and mixed tree species forests [59]. Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) and Masson pine (Pinus massoniana Lamb.) are the main coniferous tree species. Sweet gum (Liquidambar formosana Hance) and Sawtooth oak (Quercus acutissima Carruth.) are the major broadleaved tree species in the study area.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area,2
627,"Field surveys were conducted under leaf-on condition in June and August 2012 and August 2013. Guided by the pre-stratified stand inventory data in 2012, a total of 67 square (30 × 30 m2) field plots were established. These plots covered multiple site indices, age classes and tree species, which can be classified into three types according to the composition of the tree species: (i) coniferous tree species forest (n = 15); (ii) broadleaved tree species forest (n = 18); and (iii) mixed tree species forest (n = 34).The coordinates of the plot corners were acquired using Trimble GPS measurements with the result of sub-meter accuracy. All the live trees within each plot, which have a DBH > 5 cm were measured. The measurement of individual tree parameters can be seen in [41]. The dead wood and small trees which has a DBH < 5 cm within the plot were also recorded, but excluded in the calculations of biomass and volume. The six plot-level forest structural parameters, including DBH, HL, N, G, V and AGB, were calculated using the measured individual tree data. Species-specific allometric equations and general volume equations of local or nearby provinces were used to calculate AGB and V, respectively (Table A1 and Table A2). Within each plot, the AGB and V of each individual tree were calculated according to the DBH and H measured in the field, and then summed to the plot-level AGB and V. Table 1 provides a summary of the six forest structural parameters at plot-level.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Field Data,2
628,"In August 2013, the airborne full-waveform LiDAR and hyperspectral data were simultaneously obtained using the LiCHy System [60]. The platform was flown at the height of 900 m above ground and the datasets covered the whole Yushan Forest. Full-waveform LiDAR data were obtained using the Riegl LMS-Q680i scanner. The scanning angle was ±15° from nadir, and the pulse repetition frequency was 360 kHz. The temporal sample spacing for recording returned waveforms was 1 ns (15 cm in distance approximately), and the size of the footprint at nadir was 0.45 m in diameter. In the overlapping regions, the pulse density was three times higher than a single strip. Hyperspectral data were acquired using an AISA Eagle II sensor with 64 bands and the spectral resolution was 3.3 nm. The sensor obtained hyperspectral images in the pattern of push-broom imaging and the spectrum ranges covered from 400 nm to 970 nm. The spatial and radiative resolution of the hyperspectral data were 0.6 m and 12 bit, respectively. The geometric accuracy of each pixel was less than one meter with an inertial measurement unit (IMU), which utilized real-time differential corrections by a 12-channel GPS receiver.

629," 2.4.1. Full-Waveform LiDAR Data Pre-ProcessingFirst, a de-noising algorithm and a Gaussian filter were applied to suppress and smooth the background noise of each returned waveform. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) was used to calculate the kernel size of Gaussian filter [61]. Then, the locations and amplitudes of each peak within the waveform were extracted using a local maxima peak detection filter [62]. Finally, the returned waveform was decomposed using the Gaussian decomposed algorithm.The LiDAR point clouds can be derived from the FWF LiDAR data using the Gaussian decomposed algorithm.

The ai, ti and σi are the parameters corresponding to pulse amplitude, time of round trip, and the pulse width, respectively [31]. Then, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and a nonlinear least squares method were applied to fit multiple Gaussian components into the backscattered waveform. The LiDAR point clouds extracted from FWF LiDAR data were stored as the format of LAS 1.3 and used for analysis.In this study, the points in the ground and upper surface of the forest canopy were applied to create the digital terrain model (DTM) and digital surface model (DSM), respectively. The cell size of DTM and DSM was 0.6 m, the same as the resolution of the hyperspectral data. The value in each cell was calculated as the mean elevation of these points, and the cells which had no points were interpolated using neighboring cells by a linear interpolation approach. The value of the DTM was subtracted from each point elevation to calculate the normalized point cloud of whole study area.The returned pulse width (WiГ, the standard deviation of pulse) and amplitude (IiГ, the integral of returned waveform, which represent the pulse energy) were derived from Gaussian components [63]. In this study, the pulse width (WiГ) and amplitude (IiГ) were calibrated using a physical process-driven approach [31]. The values of the pulse width (We) and amplitude (Ie) of the scanner emitted pulses were used to calibrate WiГ and IiГ, and the IiГ was corrected for the loss of signal using the distance between the sensor and the object (Di) and the normalization distance of Do [30]:

The value of k which depended on the attenuation of signal occur in the atmosphere was set to 2 [30], and the Do was set to 900 m (the mean height of the platform).It has been demonstrated in previous studies that the waveform is stretched by the increase in the off-nadir angle [64,65]. Moreover, due to the obtained airborne FWF LiDAR data are normally comprised of multiple overlapping strips, the waveforms in a specific location may come from several strips [66,67]. In this study, a voxel-based approach to composite waveforms was used to correct FWF data to avoid the influences of off-nadir angle in the waveform shape and to integrate non-vertical waveforms from multiple strips into composited vertical waveforms. This approach first decomposed the forest canopies into voxels by vertical space partition (0.6 × 0.6 × 0.3 m3), and then synthesized raw waveforms from multiple strips into composite vertical waveforms using the maximum amplitude value in each voxel (Figure 3). Each composite vertical waveform was normalized using the digital terrain model (DTM). 2.4.2.

Then, the geometric-rectified images were mosaicked into a single scene. Atmospheric correction was applied using an empirical line model, combined with field-measured reflectance spectra of different target objects obtained by ASD FieldSpec spectrometer, to get the surface reflectance of covers. In this study, the FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral data were integrated at feature level based on a common coordinate frame. The framework of integration usage of these two datasets can be seen in Figure 3. In order to have the best possible geographical matches between the FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral data, the hyperspectral data were co-registered to the digital surface model (DSM) which calculated from FWF LiDAR data. In the area of each plot, more than 30 ground control points (GCPs) were used on the hyperspectral image (30 × 30 m2).

First, the forest canopy was decomposed into a matrix of voxels, the size of each voxel was 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.3 m3. Second, the voxels within the matrix were classified into “filled” if there was energy returned from the voxel and classified into “empty” if there was no energy returned from the voxel. Third, the “filled” voxels were classified as “euphotic” and “oligophotic” depending on whether the voxel was above or below the threshold height of the uppermost 65% for all “filled” voxels. Finally, the “empty” voxels were classified into “open” and “closed” gap zones depending on whether they were located above or below the filled voxels. 2.5.2.

where α and β are the parameters of Weibull, z is the height and H is the maximum canopy height in a plot.The zones of crown volume model (i.e., Og, Cg, E and O) were used to characterize the forest crown volume and spatial arrangement of the canopy materials in three-dimensions [69]. First, the forest canopy was decomposed into a matrix of voxels, the size of each voxel was 0.6 × 0.6 × 0.3 m3. Second, the voxels within the matrix were classified into “filled” if there was energy returned from the voxel and classified into “empty” if there was no energy returned from the voxel. Third, the “filled” voxels were classified as “euphotic” and “oligophotic” depending on whether the voxel was above or below the threshold height of the uppermost 65% for all “filled” voxels. Finally, the “empty” voxels were classified into “open” and “closed” gap zones depending on whether they were located above or below the filled voxels.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5.1.

634,"Full-waveform metrics (FW) provide three-dimensional forest structure information by extracting radiometric and geometric properties of recorded backscattered waveforms. In this study, 18 full-waveform metrics including the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) within each plot were extracted from composite waveforms (Figure 3). First, the full-waveform metrics (Table 3) of each composite waveform were calculated; second, the mean and standard deviation of all the full-waveform metrics in each plot were calculated as the full-waveform metrics at plot-level. Table 3 gives the summary of these full-waveform metrics and descriptions.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5.2. Full-Waveform Metrics,2
635,"The hyperspectral metrics (HS) are good indices in the prediction of forest structural properties, due to their ability to describe crown structures, which are related to vegetation pigments, physiology and stress, directly or indirectly. In this study, 112 hyperspectral metrics were derived from the preprocessed hyperspectral image, including: (i) reflectance values from AISA Eagle II channels; (ii) vegetation indices; (iii) first 10 components of the principal component transformation (PCT), independent components transformation (ICT) and minimum noise fraction transformation (MNF).The spectral reflectance was strongly correlated with the structural properties (e.g., leaf area index, the amount of biomass and spatial arrangement of structures) of forests [70]. In this study, all channels in the domains of VIS, RE, and NIR were used. The mean values of 50 × 50 pixels within the plots were calculated from the reflectance of the entire 64 channels. The same procedure for calculation was followed to extract the other hyperspectral metrics (vegetation indices and first 10 components of PCT, ICT and MNF).Hyperspectral vegetation indices, which rely on specific absorption features, are the most commonly used narrow band metrics. The vegetation indices calculated from the hyperspectral image have great advantages in predicting forest structural parameters [23,49]. In this study, 18 vegetation indices were extracted and summarized in Table 4.The principal component analysis (PCA), minimum noise fraction analysis (MNF) and independent components analysis (ICA) are three algorithms which are commonly used to de-noise and extract primary information from hyperspectral images. We used these three approaches to calculate 192 components (64 components for each approach), out of which we used the first 10 of each approach for analysis, to explore whether there was a component that summarized the forest structural parameters-related channels to one value, and therefore, to ensure the models’ conciseness [48,86].", 2.

636,"Previous studies have demonstrated that optimization of the candidate metrics can reduce irrelevant and redundant information and help create highly efficient, transferable and robust productive models. In this study, all of the FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics were first optimized using correlation analysis. The 15 metrics, which had relatively high correlation with the forest structural parameters, were correspondingly selected from point cloud metrics (DPC), full-waveform metrics (FW) and hyperspectral metrics (HS). Then, the 45 metrics (15 point cloud, 15 full-waveform and 15 hyperspectral metrics) were analyzed using the biplot of PCA, which can be used to select the important metrics in the clusters [87]. The 12 point cloud, 8 full-waveform and 10 hyperspectral metrics which highly correlated with the first and second principal component (r > 0.7) and were selected from the three groups divided by the PCA. Finally, the five metrics that had the highest correlations with the first and second principal component in each group were selected as the best metrics to fit the combo models.The backward stepwise regression approach was applied to relate FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics to field-measured forest structural parameters. In the models, three predictor variables at the 5% significance level were selected. To ensure the metrics in the models had no serious collinearity, the models which had the condition number (k) < 30 were selected. Finally, according to the value of the Akaike information criterion (AIC), the best fitting models with the lowest AIC were selected.In the study, three types of predictive models of DBH, HL, N, G, V and AGB were developed using DPC, FW, HS and an integration of two or three of these for the combo models. First, the DPC models (DPC based models) were fitted using 12 DPC alone to predict the six forest structural parameters; second, the FW models (DPC and FW based models) were fitted using the integration of 12 DPC and 8 FW to predict the six forest structural parameters; third, the combo models were fitted using the integration of the best metrics (each of the five metrics selected from PCA groups) to predict the six forest structural parameters. All of the models were assessed by adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj-R2), Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE), and relative RMSE (rRMSE). The leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation was applied to assess the accuracy of prediction models and assess the synergetic effects of FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics.", 2.

637,"All of the metrics, including the point cloud metrics (n = 17), full-waveform metrics (n = 18) and hyperspectral metrics (n = 112) were extracted from the LiDAR point cloud (with height normalized), composite waveform and preprocessed hyperspectral image, respectively. Figure 4 shows the profiles of point cloud and apparent foliage (I), profiles of intensity of energy and composite waveform (II), and the spectral reflectance from 400 nm to 1000 nm (III). The profiles of apparent foliage and Weibull distribution appropriately describe the vertical distribution of point cloud. The peak of the Weibull distribution curve in broadleaved forest plot is relatively higher (height = 8.55 m), followed by the mixed forest plot (height = 6.34 m), and the peak of the Weibull distribution curve in coniferous plots is relatively lower (height = 5.41 m). The profiles of composite waveform truly describe the space distribution of energy, and the height of peaks of composite waveform are same as the height of energy concentration. The profiles of intensity of energy and composite waveform are similar to the profiles of point cloud and Weibull distribution, respectively. The spectral reflectance describes the biophysical and biochemical properties of the canopy. The spectral reflectance in the broadleaved forest plot is highest (mean = 0.06–0.52), followed by spectral reflectance in the coniferous forest plot (mean = 0.06–0.41), and spectral reflectance in the mixed forest plot is lowest (mean = 0.05–0.33).", 3.

638,"Figure 5 shows the projection of the first two PCA scores from the selected point cloud (n = 15), full-waveform (n = 15) and hyperspectral (n = 15) metrics. The first (PCA1) and second (PCA2) components of PCA account for 57.61% and 31.02% of the total variance, respectively. In the four groups divided by PCA, 37 metrics in three groups were highly correlated with the PCA1 and PCA2. The 12 point cloud (h25, h50, h75, h95, d1, d5, d9, hcv, Cover, Wα, E, O), 8 full-waveform (HOMEμ, WDμ, VDRμ, NPμ, RWEμ, Intμ, HOMEσ, WDσ) and 10 hyperspectral (B45, B63, VOG1, NDVI, RVSI, EVI, ARVI, CRI1, PCA1, PCA2) metrics were correlated with the PCA1 and PCA2 higher than 0.7. Most of the point cloud and full-waveform metrics were in the opposite direction. Moreover, most of hyperspectral metrics and FWF LiDAR metrics (point cloud and full-waveform metrics) were orthonormal. Therefore, the FWF LiDAR metrics and hyperspectral metrics could be used as complementary metrics in forest structural parameters prediction.The five point cloud metrics (h50, h75, d1, E, O), five full-waveform metrics (HOMEμ, VDRμ, NPμ, RWEμ, and WDσ) and five hyperspectral metrics (NDVI, RVSI, ARVI, CRI1 and PCA2), which had the highest correlation with PCA1 and PCA2 in each group are shown in Figure 6. According to the result of the correlation analysis, most of the metrics had weak relationships with each other (r < 0.7) (Figure 6). Therefore, the metrics in the combo models were non-collinear and the combo models were robust. The hyperspectral metrics of CRI1 and PCA2 had the weakest relationships with the other metrics. However, the metrics related to crown height were relatively strongly correlated with each other (h50, h75 and HOMEμ) and the waveform metric HOMEμ had a relatively strong positive correlation with the hyperspectral metrics of RVSI.", 3.

642,"Cross validation of the combo models demonstrated that the relationship between field surveyed and predicted forest structural parameters were close to the 1:1 line (Figure 7). The mean differences between field surveyed and cross-validated models predicted forest structural parameters were not significant statistically (Table 8). The Lorey’s mean height model had the highest accuracy (CV-R2 = 0.85, CV-rRMSE = 11.50%), followed by the above ground biomass (CV-R2 = 0.80, CV-rRMSE = 17.82%), volume (CV-R2 = 0.77, CV-rRMSE = 17.95%), stem number (CV-R2 = 0.70, CV-rRMSE = 22.90%) and DBH (CV-R2 = 0.65, CV-rRMSE = 23.80%); the basal area model had the lowest accuracy (CV-R2 = 0.63, CV-rRMSE = 29.04%).

It shows that the combo models, which fitted using full-waveform LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics have the smallest variation, followed by the models fitted using full-waveform LiDAR metrics, while the models fitted using point cloud metrics have the largest variation.", 3. Results, 3.6. Assessment of the Predictive Models,3
643,"In this study, the forest structural parameters in subtropical forests were predicted using simultaneously acquired airborne FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral data. The airborne LiDAR data turned out to be the most applicable remote sensing data in forest structural parameters prediction due to its ability to measure the three dimensional structures of forest canopy [16,88]. The hyperspectral data recorded large amounts of continuous narrow bands from VIS to NIR which can provide continuous and detailed spectral signatures of forest biophysical attributes [89,90]. Previous studies have demonstrated that the integration of these two complementary datasets can improve the prediction of forest structural parameters [52,57]. It was also proved in this study, although the FWF LiDAR metrics (only DPC or the integration of DPC and FW) can predict forest structural parameters with relatively high accuracy (Adj-R2 = 0.52–0.81, rRMSE = 15.70–40.87%; Adj-R2 = 0.62–0.87, rRMSE = 11.01–31.30%), the integration of FWF LiDAR metrics and hyperspectral metrics performs better (Adj-R2 = 0.68–0.88, rRMSE = 10.68–28.67%). Zhang et al. [91] predicted six forest structural parameters using only small footprint point cloud LiDAR data in 51 square plots (30 × 30 m2) in the same study site of subtropical forest. Compared with the results in this study, less variabilities in forest structural parameters were explained (45–77%). Dalponte et al. [42] predicted stem diameter and volume using integrated small footprint point cloud LiDAR and hyperspectral data in 52 plots in a temperate forest. The results indicated that the improvements in the prediction of stem diameter and volume using integrated LiDAR and hyperspectral data were 0.4% and 0.5% (rRMSE), respectively. Luo et al. [57] predicted AGB using integrated airborne small footprint point cloud LiDAR and hyperspectral data in 33 plots in a northern temperate deciduous forest. It reported that 2.2% more of the variability in AGB was explained, and 7.9% less predicted error occurred by using integrated point cloud LiDAR and hyperspectral data. The improvement from using integrated point cloud LiDAR and hyperspectral data was slightly higher than this study. This may be caused by the complex structure of subtropical forest, which is multilayered and has greater variability in DBH and tree height, which reduce the ability of the hyperspectral data to predict forest structural parameters.In the combo models, the five metrics selected from point cloud, full-waveform and hyperspectral metrics had improved synergetic effects for forest structural parameters prediction. Compared with the DPC based models and FWF LiDAR metrics models, the combo models of six forest structural parameters all performed better, explaining large amounts of variability in forest structural parameters (Table 7). Moreover, in Figure 8 the residuals of the combo models were smaller than FWF LiDAR metrics models, and the residuals of DPC-based models were maximal. The distribution of residuals in the combo models were more convergent and the mean of residuals were closer to zero. Consequently, the combo models were more accurate and robust, which indicated that the integration of FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral data has great potential in the prediction of forest structural parameters in subtropical forest.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Synergetic Effects of the Full-Waveform LiDAR and Hyperspectral Data,4
644,"The parametric regression modeling approach (i.e., backward stepwise regression), which is easy to transplant and can help to understand the relationships between metrics and forest structural parameters, was used to fit predictive models in this study. In Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7, the final models fitted by backward stepwise regression approach are shown. In these tables, the forest structural parameter of HL had the highest accuracy, and this indicated that full-waveform LiDAR data has unique advantages in the prediction of tree height. Previous studies have demonstrated that the tree height predicted by LiDAR data was similar to field-based measurements [92], and the forest structural parameters related to vegetation height were predicted accurately [93,94]. In this study, it was also confirmed that the outcomes for volume and AGB had a relatively high accuracy.The full-waveform LiDAR data can provide more information compared with point cloud LiDAR data. The full-waveform metrics, such as HOME and WD, were found to be sensitive to the vertical arrangement of canopy elements and canopy height [95,96]. With the addition of full-waveform metrics, the improvement in the accuracy of predictive models was significant (Table 5 and Table 6). In particular, for G, V and AGB, the improvement of rRMSE is over 10%. Although the hyperspectral data has limitations in quantifying the vertical structure of forest, the hyperspectral metrics (e.g., NDVI, CRI1 and RVSI, etc.) still have the capability to improve the accuracy of forest structural parameters prediction (ΔrRMSE = 0.27–2.63%). This indicates that hyperspectral metrics have great potential in the prediction of forest structural parameters.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Implications of Predictive Models,4
645,"Point cloud metrics are significantly related to the three-dimensional structural properties of forest canopy, which allow the prediction of the forest structural parameters. Five point cloud metrics, i.e., the 50th percentile height (h50), 75th percentile height (h75), 10th canopy return density (d1), euphotic zones of CVM (E), and the oligophotic zones of CVM (O) were selected to fit the combo models (Table 7). h50 and h75 were respectively defined as the heights above ground that are 50% and 75% of the LiDAR returns below the height. h50 likely provides the height of the over-story and h75 presents the spatial variability of the canopy height [25]. Thomas et al. [97] reported that the point cloud metrics of h50 and h75 were strongly related to mean dominated height, basal area, crown closure and AGB. Tsui et al. [25] found that h50 and h75 were the main metrics to explain the majority of the variation in AGB. In the combo models, the h50 and h75 were selected in the predictive models of AGB and HL, respectively, and the rRMSE of AGB and HL were 15.14% and 10.68%, respectively. The d1 was the percentage of points above the 10th quantile to total quantity of points in the plot. This can be used to represent the structure of tree canopy. Previous studies have shown that the d1 performed well in the prediction of mean dominated tree height and volume [18,53]. In this study, d1 was selected in the prediction of volume and the rRMSE was 16.37%. E and O were the metrics related to the light extinction in the tree canopy, and are thought to be a three-dimensional analog of cover [69]. They perform well in the prediction of forest structural parameters (e.g., DBH, height, basal area and biomass etc.) [98]. Here, the point cloud metrics of E and O were selected in the prediction of stem number and the predictive model of stem number performed well (rRMSE = 20.16%).The returned waveforms of the laser system record the specific reflections within the footprint, and are influenced by the materials and vertical structures of canopy. The shape of the returned waveforms can be used to predict forest structural parameters appropriately [7,33]. Sumnall et al. [34] extracted full-waveform metrics (amplitude and echo width variables) from full-waveform data and reported that the full-waveform metrics performed well in the prediction of forest structural parameters (the NRMSE values for the best fit models were in the range of 16–48%). In this study, five waveform metrics, i.e., mean of height of median energy (HOMEμ), mean of vertical distribution ratio (VDRμ), mean of number of peaks (NPμ), mean of returned waveform energy (RWEμ), and the standard deviation of waveform distance (WDσ), were selected to fit the combo models (Table 7). HOMEμ describes the arrangement of canopy materials in the vertical direction and VDRμ depicts the change of HOMEμ relative to the height of canopy. These two metrics help to enhance the interpretation of intermediate tree canopies in the mid-story and suppress the trees in the understory. Therefore, the two full-waveform metrics potentially improved the prediction of forest structural parameters. In the combo models, HOMEμ and VDRμ were selected to predict V, DBH and AGB, and the rRMSE were 16.37%, 23.11% and 15.14%, respectively. NPμ and RWEμ were the full-waveform metrics used to describe the number of peak and energy of composited waveform, respectively. NPμ and RWEμ were likely related to the arrangement and density of forest materials, which can be used to represent the forest structure. Thus, NPμ and RWEμ were selected in the combo predictive models of DBH and G, and the rRMSE were 23.11% and 28.67%, respectively. WDσ was the full-waveform metric defined as the standard deviation of distances of waveform, which is related to the variation of crown height to some extent. It potentially helped in the prediction of forest structure variables related to tree height. In this study, WDσ was selected in the combo prediction of HL and it performed well (rRMSE = 10.68%).Previous studies have demonstrated that hyperspectral metrics have unique effects in the prediction of forest structural parameters. In this study, the integrated usage of FWF LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics improved the accuracies of forest structural parameters. Compared with the prediction using point cloud metrics only, the improvements in prediction were significant (ΔAdj-R2 = 0.07–0.16, ΔrRMSE = 5.02–13.91%). Compared with the prediction using point cloud and full-waveform metrics, the improvements in prediction were distinct (ΔAdj-R2=0.01–0.07, ΔrRMSE = 0.27–2.63%). In this study, five hyperspectral metrics, i.e., normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), red-edge vegetation stress index (RVSI), atmospherically resistant vegetation index (ARVI), carotenoid reflectance index 1 (CRI1) and the second component of PCA transformation (PCA2), were selected to fit the combo models (Table 7). Many studies have indicated that the NDVI and ARVI are correlated with forest structures such as the leaf area index (LAI) and forest AGB [58,99,100]. Latifi et al. [23] reported that the ARVI was also correlated with mean height. Wang et al. [101] extracted NDVI and ARVI from hyperspectral data and reported that the biomass predictive models performed well using the two metrics (rRMSE = 13.9% and 15.8%). In the combo models, NDVI and ARVI were selected to predict HL, AGB and G, and the rRMSE was 10.68%, 15.14% and 28.67%, respectively. RVSI was the hyperspectral metric used to identify vegetation stress trends based on the spectral shifting of red-edge. CRI1 is a metric representing reflectance of carotenoid, which was directly correlated with the content of carotenoid. The RVSI and CRI1 potentially improved the prediction of forest structural parameters due to the profound influences of stress and photosynthetic pigments in the forest structure formation. The RVSI and CRI1 were selected in the combo models of N and DBH, and the rRMSE were 20.16% and 23.11%, respectively. PCA analysis was widely used to reduce the dimensions of the dataset. In general, the first several components contain the most of variance in the dataset. In this study, PCA2 contained much more variances of hyperspectral reflectance channels and might d perform well in the prediction of forest structural parameters. In the combo models, PCA2 was selected to predict V and the rRMSE of prediction was 16.37%.The full-waveform LiDAR metrics (including point cloud and full-waveform metrics) have the ability to record the forest structure in detail. In Figure 4, the vertical distribution of point cloud and pulse energy indicate the distribution of forest materials and the transmission of energy in the canopy. The hyperspectral metrics are associated with the biophysical and biochemical attributes of forest, which can be used to reflect the health conditions and growth stage of forest vegetation (e.g., Figure 4 (III)). Therefore, the full-waveform LiDAR metrics, hyperspectral metrics and the forest structural parameters predicted in this study can be used to assess the structural, compositional and functional properties of forest ecosystems. Moreover, the forest nutritional status, wildlife habitat, and ecosystem service value can also be evaluated using the full-waveform LiDAR and hyperspectral data.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Availability of Full-Waveform LiDAR and Hyperspectral Metrics,4
646,"This study combined full-waveform LiDAR and hyperspectral data in the feature level, and the addition of hyperspectral metrics in full-waveform LiDAR metrics improved the accuracy of forest structural parameters. In the future, more advanced approaches associated with physical theory or the mechanisms of sensors will be used to explore the better integration of full-waveform LiDAR and hyperspectral data. Moreover, the non-parametric modeling approach can be used to enhance the capability of prediction of forest structural parameters in subtropical forests.", 4. Discussion, 4.4. Potential Improvements and Indications for Future Research,4
647,"Simultaneously acquired airborne full-waveform (FWF) LiDAR and hyperspectral data were used to predict forest structural parameters in subtropical forests of southeast China. The pulse amplitude and waveform shape of airborne full-waveform LiDAR data (FWF) were calibrated using a physical process-driven and a voxel-based approach, respectively. Different suites of LiDAR and hyperspectral metrics were calculated and selected using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA). The selected point cloud, full-waveform and hyperspectral metrics were used to fit regression models individually and in integration to predict six forest structural parameters, and the capability of predictive models and synergetic effects of metrics were assessed using leave-one-out cross validation. The results showed that: most of the metrics selected from three groups divided by the PCA analysis, which were highly correlated with the first and second principal component, had a weak relationship with each other (r < 0.7); the prediction of HL using the metrics of h75, WDσ and NDVI had a relatively higher accuracy (Adjusted-R2 = 0.88, relative RMSE = 10.68%) than the other forest structural parameters; and the usage of DPC and FW resulted in higher accuracies (Adjusted-R2 = 0.62–0.87, relative RMSE = 11.01–31.30%) than the models only including DPC (Adjusted-R2 = 0.52–0.81, relative RMSE = 15.70–40.87%). Moreover, the integration of DPC, FW and HS had a positive synergetic effect for forest structural parameters prediction (Adjusted-R2 = 0.68–0.88, relative RMSE = 10.68–28.67%).", 5. Conclusions,None,5
648,"Biomass maps derived from remote sensing methods are an effective way to conduct detailed, spatially explicit carbon accounting of vegetation over large areas. They are crucial for the understanding of the global carbon budget and for quantifying the CO2 sequestration by forests [1]. In recent years, considerable effort has been made to improve forest biomass mapping approaches and to generate maps with increasing spatial resolutions. A frequently applied method for aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation uses remote sensing data from active sensor systems, such as light detection and ranging (lidar) or synthetic aperture radar [2]. Such data are used to generate metrics of canopy height, which are linked to AGB via regression models [3]. Canopy height metrics and AGB are calculated in an area-based way, i.e., representing the whole forest over a certain area, and not at the individual tree level [4]. The area sizes used depend on the size of the available ground-truth plots for the calculation of the reference AGB, the footprint size of the lidar system, or the desired resolution of the produced AGB map [5].The AGB of single trees in the ground-truth plots is commonly geolocated at their stem positions. This is done mostly for practical reasons, but it can also be justified structurally because most of a tree’s AGB is contained in the stem. The canopy height metrics, on the other hand, are calculated from the remote sensing signal, which results from reflections from the tree crowns. The tree crowns cover a certain spatial extent around the stem positions. Hence, there is a spatial mismatch between the remote sensing metrics and the ground-truth [6]. As long as the entire tree crown is contained within the considered plot area, this mismatch does not pose a problem. However, at the borders of plots, tree crowns can reach out of the plot (outgoing crowns) and crowns from outside trees can reach into the plot (incoming crowns). These outgoing and incoming crowns affect the values of the canopy height metrics calculated for the plot, while for the ground-truth AGB calculation the plot borders are strict borders, and only tree stems inside the plot are considered, independent of their crown extension [6,7]. The uncertainty in the height–biomass relationship caused by incoming and outgoing tree crowns is referred to as a ‘border effect’. Other studies have also called it an ‘edge effect’, but because this term in forest ecology is often understood as the effects leading to altered forest dynamics near forest edges [8], we chose here to use the term ‘border effect’ to avoid misunderstandings.The proportion of incoming and outgoing tree crowns is expected to be larger the smaller the plot sizes are. In general, it has been found that uncertainties in biomass estimation at the single-plot level increase with decreasing plot size, which is usually observed as an increase in the root mean square error and a decrease in the R² for biomass estimates [5,6,9,10,11]. This means that area-based biomass maps cannot be produced at arbitrarily fine resolutions without generating large uncertainties at the level of the single estimates. Border effects are thought to be one major contribution to this uncertainty. In order to better understand their contribution, it is important to have an idea about the magnitude of the incoming and outgoing crown volume and surface. Quantifying these proportions with empirical data is difficult because it would require a large number of crown measurements. Alternatively, the proportions can be analyzed using allometric assumptions and simulations in combination with forest inventory data [7,11,12]. Simulations have the additional advantage that the border effects can be switched off in the biomass estimation in order to quantify the residual uncertainty in the height–biomass relationship in an ideal situation where border effects do not exist. This can be achieved by enforcing periodic boundary conditions on the simulated tree crowns. Periodic boundaries are a common concept in ecological modeling, which are used to avoid edge effects in simulations [13]. They imply that the modelled area corresponds to a torus, which cannot be left. If something leaves the modelled area on one side it reappears on the opposite side. For the simulated tree crowns in this study, this means that the crowns which leave the plot on one end reappear on the opposite side, while no crowns from trees which are outside the plot are allowed to enter. With this approach, idealized analyses can be conducted, wherein the simulated remote sensing signal is generated exclusively (no incoming crowns) and entirely (if outgoing, then reappearing) by the crowns of trees which have their stem position inside the plot. This idealized approach helps to investigate the pure influence of the border effect on lidar-derived biomass estimates.In this study, such simulations were conducted for a tropical rainforest in Panama using different plot sizes and shapes, including the circular footprints of the spaceborne lidars ICESat GLAS (65 m diameter) [14,15] and GEDI (23 m diameter) [16], in order to answer the following two questions: (1) How large are the proportions of the incoming and outgoing crown volume and canopy surface at different scales? (2) What is the contribution of border effects to the uncertainty in AGB estimations at different scales? ", 1. Introduction,None,1.
649,"Data from the Barro Colorado Island (BCI) 50-ha plot were used [17,18,19,20,21]. Located in central Panama at 9.15°N and 79.85°W, BCI is a neotropical moist lowland old-growth forest site. It has served as a research site for tropical ecology for several decades. Because of the large continuous inventory dataset, several studies about forest structure and biomass estimation from lidar have been conducted for BCI [6,22,23,24]. In this study, the census data from 2010 were used, which comprises 246,913 trees with a minimum diameter at breast height (DBH) of 1 cm. For each tree, the position within the plot was recorded. The tree height, crown diameter and aboveground biomass were calculated for each tree as follows. The tree height H was calculated from DBH (in m units) using a Michaelis–Menten Equation (1).

The random variability ε was modelled as a normal distribution, for which the standard deviation (σ = 0.39) was derived from the residuals of Equation (2) with respect to the 12,348 trees in the dataset [25]. The normal distribution was truncated at the 95% prediction intervals (±1.96·σ) in order to avoid negative and unrealistically large crown diameter values. The crown length was calculated as 0.4 times tree height [11]. For each tree, a leaf area index of 2 was assumed, which—in combination with the crown volume—allowed the calculation of the leaf area density. These assumptions about crown length and leaf area density have proven suitable for forest and lidar simulations for BCI before [11]. The aboveground biomass of each single tree (AGBtree) was calculated using a generic tropical tree biomass allometry (Equation (4) corresponding to “Model 5” from [26]) with the DBH, estimated tree height H, and wood density WD of the species [27] as inputs.

650,"The geometrical information of every tree was used to construct a three-dimensional representation of the forest stand assuming spheroid tree crowns (equally elongated in the X and Y directions but different in the Z direction) based on the inventory dataset. The spatial resolution of the voxels in 3D space was 1 m × 1 m × 1 m. The voxel forest was stored as a data table with rows representing tree crown voxels. The columns contained the X, Y and Z coordinates of the voxels, the leaf area density, and additional information about the tree to which the voxel belongs (e.g., tree ID, X and Y position of the stem). Knowing, for each voxel, the coordinates and also the position of the associated stem was a requirement for the later analysis of incoming and outgoing crowns. A subset of the data table was stored representing only the upper surfaces of the tree crowns which are visible from above (i.e., the voxel with the maximal Z value for each unique combination of X and Y). Raster representations of the upper canopy surface are commonly called canopy height models (CHM). They can be derived from lidar point clouds, photogrammetry, or radar. CHMs from airborne lidar are commonly derived with a simple point-to-raster method for dense point clouds, or via interpolation methods for less dense point clouds [28]. Hence, rasterizing the maximal Z value for each unique X and Y combination in our 3D voxel space leads to a simulated CHM of 1-m resolution, which is entirely based on the inventory data and allometric relationships. Because, for the simulated lidar, there is no geolocation error with respect to the inventory, the pure border effect can be studied.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Voxel Forest Generation,2
651,"For different plot sizes, it was analyzed which proportion of the tree crowns over a plot is incoming (i.e., belongs to trees that stand outside the plot area) and which proportion of tree crowns of the trees on the plot is outgoing (i.e., falls outside the plot area). For this purpose, the 50-ha plot was divided into subplots with side lengths of 10, 20, 50 and 100 m, respectively. For each plot size, each voxel was labeled with (a) a plot ID of the voxel’s X and Y position, and (b) a plot ID of the corresponding tree stem’s X- and Y-position. This allowed us to easily distinguish between voxels which are located over the same plot as their tree stems and voxels which are located over a plot other than the plot of their tree stems.For each plot at each scale, the following quantities were computed by counting the respective numbers of 1-m³ voxels: (1) the total crown volume of all of the trees standing inside a plot (CVt); (2) the total crown volume that is exactly above the plot (CVp); (3) the crown volume that fulfills both of the previous conditions, i.e., the voxel is above the plot and the tree stem is inside the plot (CVt&p); (4) the incoming crown volume (CVin = CVp − CVt&p); (5) the outgoing crown volume (CVout = CVt − CVt&p); (6) the total canopy surface of all trees standing on a plot (CSt); (7) the total canopy surface that is exactly above the plot (CSp); (8) the canopy surface that fulfills both of the previous conditions, i.e., the surface is above the plot and the tree stem is inside the plot (CSt&p); (9) the incoming canopy surface (CSin = CSp − CSt&p); (10) the outgoing canopy surface (CSout = CSt − CSt&p). The means and ranges of these quantities were calculated for each spatial scale. Figure 1 illustrates some of these quantities.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Crown Space Quantification,2
652,"The area-based biomass estimation from simulated lidar CHMs was tested at the different plot sizes. The AGB per plot was calculated as the AGB sum of all of the trees standing inside each square-shaped plot of 10, 20, 50 and 100 m side length, and was rescaled to t ha−1 units. The subset of voxels which represent the canopy surface was interpreted as a 1-m resolution CHM (as typically derived from small footprint discrete return lidar). The mean top-of-canopy height (TCH) was calculated by averaging the heights of all of the CHM pixels over each plot. Power law regression models describing AGB as a function of TCH (Equation (5)) were fitted using maximum likelihood estimation in R [29].

653,"Large-footprint lidar waveforms were simulated to derive the mean canopy profile height (MCH) and link it to the AGB in the footprint. Unlike in the case of the CHM, in which only the voxels of the canopy surface were considered, for the waveform simulations all of the canopy voxels and also the ground voxels falling into the circular footprint areas were considered. The contribution of a voxel to the simulated waveform depended on three factors: (1) the number of crown voxels above, to account for light extinction in the canopy; (2) the distance to the footprint center, to account for the Gaussian energy distribution within a laser beam; and (3) the fact of whether the voxel was located in the canopy or on the ground. Figure 2 illustrates the waveform simulation for an example transect across a 65-m diameter footprint. Equation (6) describes the calculation of the lidar intensity I of each voxel (i.e., its contribution to the lidar waveform) mathematically. A voxel at the canopy surface and in the center of the footprint is assumed to contribute the highest possible intensity. If a voxel is further down in the canopy or more distant from the footprint center, its contribution to the reflected signal is reduced.

Light extinction was modelled using Beer–Lambert’s law, with e being the base of the natural logarithm. The light extinction coefficient k was set to 0.2 [11]. LAI is the leaf area index above the voxel, calculated as the sum of the leaf area densities of all of the voxels lying directly above (same X and Y coordinate). The Gaussian energy distribution was modelled by the quotient term in the exponent of Equation (6), where d is the distance of the voxel to the footprint center in the XY-plane, and SD is the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution, which was set to 0.5 times the footprint radius [30]. The reflectance of the forest ground voxels was down-weighted by dividing by 2.5 in order to account for the lower reflectivity of the ground vs. vegetation [31]. The reflected intensities of all of the voxels in each 1-m height layer were summed up and the waveforms were standardized to have a total sum of one (Figure 2).Waveforms were simulated for footprints of 23 m (GEDI) and 65 m (ICESat GLAS) diameters. A total of 171 footprints of each type were placed at 50 m regular spacing inside the 50-ha plot (Figure A1). The AGB per footprint was calculated as the AGB sum of all of the trees standing inside the footprint circle. The mean canopy profile height (MCH) was calculated as the intensity-weighted mean height of the waveform.

655,"In order to quantify the contribution of border effects to the uncertainty in AGB estimation, periodic boundary conditions were applied to the plots (Figure 3). Under these conditions, all of the original incoming voxels, i.e., the voxels belonging to trees which have their stem outside of the focal plot, were removed. On the other hand, outgoing voxels—i.e., voxels belonging to trees which have their stem inside the focal plot, but are themselves outside the plot—were shifted to the opposite side of the plot. Hence, the new incoming crown voxels are the ones which are outgoing on the other side. As a visual example, consider the large orange colored tree located in the middle of the 1-ha forest area displayed in Figure 3c. Its stem (and crown center) is located in the central 20-m plot, but parts of its crown are outgoing, i.e., they extend into three other plots (the left, top and top-left neighbor). After enforcing periodic boundaries, these crown parts reappear in the focal plot (from the right and bottom side and bottom-right corner, respectively; Figure 3d). For the straight borders of the square-shaped plots, the establishment of the periodic boundaries was realized by adding (left or bottom border) or subtracting (right or top border) one plot width from the X or Y coordinates of the outgoing crown voxels, respectively. For the curved borders of circular footprints there is no exact correspondence. The following solution was applied in order to generate quasi-periodic boundaries for the circular footprints: for all of the trees with stems inside the circle, virtual twins were created by copying them to exist a second time outside of the circle at the position opposite to the circle center and with the same distance to the boundary, but outwards. Then, the crown voxels falling into the circle area were selected to simulate the waveforms, as described in Section 2.5 and Figure 2.The uncertainty in the biomass estimation was quantified for the different plot sizes and shapes. Firstly, the uncertainty was quantified under normal conditions, where incoming and outgoing crowns disturb the height–biomass relationship. Secondly, the uncertainty was quantified under periodic boundary conditions, where border effects are non-existent. The difference in the nRMSE between the normal and periodic boundary conditions was used to quantify the contribution of the border effect. When this difference is divided by the overall nRMSE, the relative contribution of the border effect can be obtained. Please note, both quantities—nRMSE and the relative contribution of the border effect to the nRMSE—are given in %-units.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.7. Periodic Boundary Conditions,2
656,"The analysis showed that, in small forest plots, a considerable proportion of the crown space was either incoming or outgoing. As expected, this proportion decreased with an increasing plot size. Table 1 summarizes the observed mean and maximum values for different proportions at the investigated spatial scales (standard deviations are given in Table A1). The outgoing crown volume is presented as a proportion of the crown volume of all of the trees with stems on the plot (CVout/CVt). The incoming crown volume is likewise presented as proportion of the crown volume of all of the trees with stems on the plot (CVin/CVt). This ratio can be larger than one, and can take on quite high values, because (unlike CVout) CVin is not a subset of CVt. Thus, it is more meaningful to quantify the incoming volume as a proportion of the crown volume which is exactly located above the plot (CVin/CVp). The canopy surface areas CSin and CSout are both presented as proportions of the plot area.There was a close similarity between the proportions of the incoming/outgoing crown volume and the incoming/outgoing canopy surface. At the 10-m scale, ~30% of CV and CS were incoming and outgoing, respectively. The proportions decreased to half the size (~15%) when doubling the plot side length (20 m) and decreased to one tenth (~3%) for the ten-fold plot side length (100 m, 1-ha plots).The maxima of the incoming/outgoing crown volume were quite large. At the 10-m scale, in the most extreme cases, CVin contributed up to 95% of CVp and exceeded CVt by a factor 16. Such cases occur if the focal plot contains only very small trees with a small total crown volume and large trees from a neighboring plot dominate the canopy over the focal plot.In the case of the canopy surface, at a 10-m scale, the CHM of the plot can be entirely formed by the incoming surface, and the outgoing canopy surface can exceed the plot size by a factor 6 due to the fact that single-tree crown projection areas can be far larger than the plot size (the maximum crown diameter 28.8 m corresponding to a 652 m² crown projection area). At the 100-m scale, the maxima of all of the investigated proportions were ≤7%.When the variability in the crown diameters was included in the analysis (using Equation (3) instead of (2)), most of the proportions listed in Table 1 slightly increased (Table 2). This was expected, because introducing variability to crown diameters will lead to more crown volume overall, as the three-dimensional volumes are calculated based on the one-dimensional diameters. There are two concerns about including the variability: Firstly, it represents the variability of neotropical broadleaf rainforest trees in the database by [25], which is expected to be higher than the variability on BCI alone. Secondly, the variability in the crown shape is largely driven by competition for space among tree individuals, which was not accounted for in the simulations. For all of the further analyses, the crown diameters from the average allometry (Equation (2)) were used.", 3. Results, 3.1. Proportions of Incoming and Outgoing Crowns,3
657,"The biomass estimation uncertainty decreased strongly with the increasing plot size. The contribution of border effects also decreased with increasing plot size (Figure 4). At the 10-m scale, the overall nRMSE was 121%, with a contribution of 53% caused by border effects, and a residual nRMSE of 68% when border effects were excluded by periodic boundary conditions. At the 20-m scale, the overall nRMSE was 48%, of which 19% could be attributed to border effects and 29% was residual uncertainty. At the 50-m scale, the overall nRMSE was 17%, with 5% being contributed by border effects and 12% being residual uncertainty. At the 100-m scale, border effects became negligible, with an overall nRMSE of 7%, which did not decrease under periodic boundary conditions. Hence, the relative contributions of the border effect to the overall uncertainty were 44%, 40%, 29% and 0% at the 10-, 20-, 50- and 100-m scales, respectively (Table 3). The R² values increased from 0.49 to 0.86 with the increasing scale, while under periodic boundary conditions they were ≥0.85 at all of the scales.", 3. Results, 3.2. Biomass Estimation Results Using Square Plots and CHM,3
658,"The effect of spatial scale could also be observed for the waveform-based biomass estimations in the circular footprints. A larger footprint size resulted in a smaller overall uncertainty in the biomass estimation, as well as a smaller contribution of the border effect (Figure 5). At the scale of a GEDI footprint (23 m), the overall nRMSE was 52%, with 12% being attributable to border effects and 40% being residual uncertainty. At the scale of an ICESat GLAS footprint (65 m), the overall nRMSE was 15%, with only 1% being attributable to border effects and 14% being residual uncertainty. Hence, the relative contributions of the border effect to the overall uncertainty were 23% at the GEDI scale and 6% at the GLAS scale (Table 3). The R² values were 0.54 and 0.7 at the GEDI and GLAS scales, respectively, while under periodic boundary conditions they were ≥0.72 in both cases.The scaling behavior of the nRMSE for the different approaches is summarized in Figure 6. The distances between the black filled and grey open symbols show the contributions of the border effect to the AGB estimation at the different spatial scales, and where the waveform-based estimates lie in comparison to the CHM-based estimates at similar scales.", 3. Results, 3.3. Biomass Estimation Results Using Large-Footprint Lidar,3
659,"The Gaussian horizontal energy distribution within the laser beam has the effect that the tree crowns in the margins of the footprints contribute less to the signal than the tree crowns in the center. In order to test the magnitude of this effect, the simulations were also conducted without Gaussian weighting (Figure A2). Without Gaussian weighting, the relative contributions of the border effect to the overall uncertainty were 28% (instead of 23%) for GEDI and 17% (instead of 6%) for GLAS (Table 3).Please note that, under periodic boundary conditions, the R2 values were almost equal across all of the scales. Hence, despite the observed scale dependence of the uncertainties (nRMSE), the strengths of the relationships between the predicted and observed biomass were scale independent in the absence of border effects. These R2 values were larger for the CHM-based estimates on square plots (~0.85, Figure 4b,d,f,h) than for the large-footprint waveform-based estimates (~0.72, Figure 5b,d). The weaker R2 for the waveform-based estimates can be explained by the fact that, for CHM-based estimates, the positions of the trees per se do not play a role. The CHM is a continuous and homogeneous sample of the canopy across the whole plot area. On the contrary, in the case of Gaussian energy distribution within a large lidar footprint, the signal contribution of each tree strongly depends on its position. Trees in the center of the footprint contribute more to the signal than trees near the border of the footprint. These differences are not considered in the calculation of the ground-truth AGB. This interpretation is in line with the fact that the R2 became higher when Gaussian weighting was switched off (0.75 and 0.87, Figure A2b,d). Hence, in biomass estimation from large-footprint lidar, the Gaussian weighting has two effects: it reduces the uncertainty due to border effects, but increases the uncertainty due to the unequal signal contribution from the central and marginal parts of the footprint. This explains why, at the small scale of GEDI footprints, where border effects are strong, the nRMSE increased slightly when Gaussian weighting was switched off (from 52 to 53%, Table 3). At the larger scale of the GLAS footprint, at which border effects are weak, the nRMSE decreased slightly when Gaussian weighting was switched off (from 15 to 12%, Table 3) because of the equal signal contribution from the entire footprint area.", 3. Results, 3.4. Effects of the Gaussian Energy Distribution,3
660,"The role of border effects in forest remote sensing was investigated for a tropical forest in Panama. We quantified what proportion of the tree crown volume and observed canopy surface does not belong to trees standing inside plots, and how this proportion depends on the plot size. While at small scales, e.g., 10 m, on average, large proportions of the canopy volume and surface were incoming and outgoing (~30%), these average proportions became small at the 100-m scale (~3%). This is explained by the smaller perimeter-to-area ratio of the larger plots.We further analyzed the ways in which border effects affect biomass estimation based on a CHM or large-footprint lidar waveforms. The incoming and outgoing tree crowns influence the quality of the derived relationship between the canopy height and the biomass. Hence, the smaller the proportion of incoming and outgoing crowns, i.e., the larger the plot area, the smaller the uncertainty in the biomass estimations should be. The observed uncertainties in the biomass estimations decreased with increasing plot sizes. While at 10- and 20-m scale, the border effect was responsible for ≥40% of the overall uncertainty, it had a contribution of 29% at the 50-m scale, and it had zero contribution at the 100-m scale. For the spaceborne large-footprint lidar systems, the border effect was responsible for 23% of the uncertainty in GEDI-based biomass estimates, and for 6% of the uncertainty in the ICESat GLAS-based biomass estimates.The trend of increasing uncertainty with decreasing plot size was reported in previous studies [5,6,9,10,11]. It has partly been attributed to geolocation errors, which have smaller impacts if the plots are large [7,33], but this source of error can be ruled out in controlled simulation experiments. It is partly an effect of spatial averaging, i.e., the variability of individual trees becomes less important when aggregating over larger areas. It was found that the perimeter-to-area ratio of the plots/footprints, rather than their area alone, is a major factor in this trend [34]. The explanation behind this is the border effect, which is supported by our results.The strengths of the border effects are influenced by several factors, including the size and shape of plots/footprints and the energy distribution within them. Under the assumption of an equal square plot and footprint size, it is expected that the border effects are smaller for the large-footprint lidar for two reasons: (1) the smaller perimeter-to-area ratio of circles compared to squares, and (2) the Gaussian horizontal energy distribution within the laser beam, which lowers the contribution of the canopy space in the footprint margins. In this study, CHM-based and waveform-based estimation were not compared directly using equal plot sizes, but the described effect becomes obvious when comparing the results of the 50-m plots (2500 m2 area) to the ones of the much smaller GEDI footprints (415 m2 area) and the only slightly larger GLAS footprints (3318 m2 area). The overall biomass uncertainty between 50-m square plots and GLAS was similar (18% and 15% nRMSE) but the relative contribution of border effects was much stronger for the 50-m square plots (29% vs. 6%). Even for the much smaller GEDI footprints, for which the overall uncertainty was three times higher (52% nRMSE), the relative contribution of the border effect was smaller (23%) than for the 50-m square plots (29%). Switching off the Gaussian energy distribution increased the contributions of border effects (from 23% to 28% for GEDI; from 6% to 17% for GLAS). Thus, the Gaussian energy distribution can be considered beneficial in the sense that it reduces the magnitude of border effects, but at the same time the unequal signal contribution of trees inside the footprint (central vs. marginal position) leads to a weaker height–biomass relationship, as was shown by the R2 values. These findings can provide guidance about choosing the proper scales for minimizing border effects in biomass mapping. However, choices are constrained, because wall-to-wall maps by definition have square-shaped pixels (or in rare cases hexagonal [35], but never circular pixels) and laser beams, by design, have circular cross-sectional areas with Gaussian energy distribution.It should be mentioned that the results of this study were derived using general allometries for neotropical trees [25]. Because these trees can grow to very large crown sizes, and because the site is an old growth forest, the reported incoming and outgoing crown fractions and the border effect contributions are probably at the high end of values when compared with other forest types worldwide. In temperate and boreal forests—particularly those with coniferous trees, which often have more slender crowns—these fractions and contributions may be smaller. On the other hand, the experiment regarding the introduction of variability into the crown allometry has shown that border effects might even be slightly stronger than those derived by using the average allometric relation.The finding that border effects no longer play a role at scales ≥1 ha is in accordance with previous work. Mascaro et al. [6] drew similar conclusions using a different approach, wherein they introduced the concept of crown-distributed—instead of stem-localized—biomass for the reference ground truth. For high-resolution discrete lidar data, border effects could be avoided by using biomass estimation methods based on individual tree crown delineation. Such approaches allow us to produce very high (e.g., 1-m) resolution biomass maps from lidar that closely resemble crown-distributed biomass maps from ground inventory [36]. However, individual-based approaches are not applicable over large areas with current technology, due to limitations in data acquisition and distribution and computational capacities [37]; in particular, the waveforms produced by spaceborne lidar systems require area-based interpretations.Simulation studies, like the one presented here, can help to disentangle the contributions of various sources of uncertainty in remote sensing interpretation, including the border effect, but also others. Previous studies using similar approaches have already analyzed geolocation-induced uncertainty [7] and allometry-induced and structure-induced uncertainty [38]. Future studies could include all of these aspects simultaneously in order to analyze the combined uncertainty and then partition it into its components. More generally, such simulations may serve as a method for the fusion of remote sensing data with dynamic forest models [39], which enables new interpretations of remote sensing products for forest structure [40] and new possibilities for model and allometry calibration [12,41].", 4.

661,"Quantifying the fractions of incoming and outgoing canopy space over forest plots is difficult, and hence their contributions to biomass estimation uncertainty are hard to separate from other sources of uncertainty. In this study, these fractions were determined for a tropical rainforest in BCI, Panama, using a bottom-up simulation approach, in which remote sensing data were simulated from field inventory and allometric assumptions. The largest fractions of incoming and outgoing crown surfaces (30%) were found at the smallest investigated scale (10-m), and the smallest fraction (3%) was found at the largest investigated scale (100-m). The contributions of border effects to biomass estimation uncertainty were quantified by applying periodic boundary conditions to the individual forest plots. At the 10-m scale, the border effects accounted for 44% of the total RMSE, while they had no influence (0% of RMSE) at the 100-m scale. For ICESat GLAS (65 m) and GEDI (23 m), the contributions of border effects to the footprint-level biomass estimates were 6% and 23%, respectively. The differences in the strengths of border effects between CHM-based biomass estimates for square-shaped plots and waveform-based biomass estimates for circular footprints are caused by two factors: (1) the different perimeter-to-area ratios of squares and circles, and (2) the low signal contribution of the canopy in the margins of a footprint due to the Gaussian energy distribution in the laser beam. The values obtained for plots of different sizes and for data of different sensor types (CHMs and large-footprint waveforms) provide guidance for the choice of biomass mapping resolutions and for the understanding of the compositions of uncertainties. The simulation approach bears the potential to analyze other sources of uncertainties in the future.", 5. Conclusions,None,5

Forests are particularly sensitive to climate change due to their relatively long lifespan and limited adaptation skills to altering environmental conditions [2]. In 2018, the total quantity of damaged wood in Germany reached almost 32 million solid cubic meters and further increased to roughly 46 million solid cubic meters in 2019 [3]. The analysis of ecological and economic effects as well as the development of silvicultural measures, which lead to resistant and resilient forest ecosystems in the face of climate change, are hereby identified as one of the biggest challenges [4].Forests directly affect local ecosystems, the global climate and, as carbon stores, balance global carbon stocks [5]. Therefore, the health status of trees is of fundamental interest to national and international sustainable forest management. The biggest influencing factors are thereby the damage caused by air pollution and the effects of climate change, including drought [6]. Despite their high relevance, the effects of drought on forest ecosystems are still not fully understood [7]. Due to logistical and financial limitations, large-scale forest conversion measures are not practically feasible in the short term which in turn suggests that the focus must be placed on those regions that are already characterized by warm and dry climatic conditions [8]. In a study by Reif et al. [4], numerous forestry and nature conservation experts were interviewed to name regions in Germany, which they believe are most affected by climate change. Regions with pine and spruce stands were hereby described as heavily endangered, especially spruces on planar to montane sites as well as locations with poor water supply. Generally, an increased vulnerability in coniferous-dominated stands is expected [4]. In addition, spruce as host trees are affected by bark beetle infestation to a large extent and, as a shallow-rooted tree species, are also highly vulnerable to storms and droughts [9,10]. This has a strong impact on the spruce wood prices which have fallen sharply due to the oversupply of timber harvesting [11,12,13]. Pine stands are also severely troubled by the current climatic conditions. After the hot and dry summer of 2018, about half of the pine trees that were located in the Karlsruher Hardtwald and already weakened by drought stress, died [14]. Drought events further promote the vulnerability of trees and therefore increase the risk of forest fires and pest infestations by e.g., the bark beetle [15,16,17,18,19]. Current trends in climate change suggest a higher frequency of droughts as well as other associated disturbing factors such as wind throws, forest fires and pest infestations in future forests [20].In order to study the impact of droughts on forest systems, many approaches were already applied using in-situ data. Yet this type of study is usually heavily limited by its area coverage and, in addition, time-consuming and labor-intensive. Furthermore, numerous indicators from in-situ studies are based on expert opinions [21]. However, these current challenges require a near-real-time and operationally applicable analysis of forest ecosystems, especially in terms of variation over space and time. In this context, remote sensing offers the opportunity to investigate the condition of forests with a large area coverage in a comparable, reproducible and cost-effective manner [6]. Freely available tools e.g., the cloud-based geospatial analysis platform Google Earth Engine(GEE) make it easier than it has ever been before to work with mass data and long time-series [22]. Remote sensing data has been successfully applied in numerous studies to monitor and analyze forests at both global and regional scale [23,24,25,26,27]. In a study by Bochenek et al. [28], high-resolution satellite imagery was used in combination with various vegetation indices in order to study the effects of changing climatic conditions in selected Polish forest regions. In particular, indices related to water stress enabled an analysis of drought events within the area of study [28]. In another work by Lewińska et al. [29], drought events in alpine forests in South Tyrol were investigated. A synergistic use of meteorological-based indices together with satellite-based vegetation indices was tested in their study. The authors identified a prolonged drought condition between 2003 and 2007 as well as a general drying tendency [29]. As mentioned in a recent review about remote sensing in German forests by Holzwarth et al. [30], monitoring forest areas via remote sensing gained increasing interest over the last two decades. However, the authors also stress the lack of studies on a national scale in contrast to local investigations [30].Towards the goal of fully exploiting the monitoring potential of the satellite systems, challenges such as noise and data gaps must be effectively addressed. These quality losses are mainly caused by sensor artifacts, clouds, cloud shadows and other weather conditions [31]. In the context of time-series analyses, harmonic modeling is a powerful tool to fill these gaps and reduce noise by smoothing the original signal [32]. Various studies have demonstrated the successful implementation of harmonic analyses for monitoring the Earth’s surface and improving classification results [33,34,35,36]. Next to improving classification results, this approach has also been used to identify changes in agricultural areas [37], landscape fragmentation [38] as well as investigating changes in land cover classes [39]. The application of the harmonic modeling generated hereby more accurate results compared to other established methods. Despite various successful implementations of this promising approach, so far, very little attention was given to the integration of harmonic computations in the context of drought-related vegetation response within forest ecosystems. Tools such as the “rHarmonics” R-package, which allows for easy computation of harmonic curves on time-series data, will hereby enable a wider audience to apply this methodology in future studies [40].This study aims to close existing gaps in the current state of research in order to enable better spatio-temporal planning for forest ecosystems in the context of climate change-induced extreme weather events. The main focus lies on the identification and quantification of vegetation response to meteorological drought conditions. Meteorological drought in Germany was analyzed using publicly available weather data provided by the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD). Optical remote sensing imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Landsat satellite missions were utilized for vegetation response assessment. Three indices (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI)) and two methods (harmonic modeling and z-score analysis), were tested together with the satellite data for the identification of the best performing predictor combination. Furthermore, different tree species were compared in their susceptibility to drought with respect to the present soil types and topographic positioning.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
663,"The following chapter provides a description of all materials used throughout this study. Detailed information on data type, spatio-temporal resolution and temporal range as well as the associated Analysis Level is also listed in Table 1. 2.1.1. Forest DataTo avoid biased results due to local environmental conditions, analyses on the relationship between meteorological and vegetational information (Analysis Level 1) were conducted on a national scale across all German forest regions. The publicly available Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2018 raster data set was used as a reference which provides land cover information with a spatial resolution of 100 m [47]. The forest classes 311 (broad-leaved forest, ∼35,920 km


2

), 312 (coniferous forest, ∼58,644 km


2

) and 313 (mixed forest, ∼13,566 km


2

) were used to create a German-wide forest mask (Figure 2a) [47]. It has to be noted, that this study assumes no land cover change, e.g., in terms of deforestation or agricultural expansion within the CLC 2018 forest area over the investigated study time period.Within the framework of this study, the Bayerische Staatsforsten (BaySF) provided a reference shapefile that covers 60 forest areas (∼229 km


2

) all over Bavaria which were used for the second analysis level (Figure 2b). Each forest reference area shows the local dominant tree species as well as forest areas that are older than 80 years. This data set was also utilized to study the influence of different soil types and topographic parameters on the drought susceptibility of forest sites. 2.1.2. Meteorological DataMonthly precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and maximum air temperature data with a spatial resolution of 1 km was downloaded as ASCII grids via the DWD Climate Data Center (CDC) [44]. Additionally to the mentioned meteorological data sets, soil moisture measurements provided by the DWD as ASCII grids with the same spatial resolution of 1 km were downloaded. The gridded values are based on weather station data which have been horizontally interpolated via an inverse distance weighting (IDW) approach for grid cells with no available station data [49]. 2.1.3. Soil Type DataSince the status of a forest also strongly depends on the present soil and nutrient composition [50,51], different soil types in their contribution to the drought vulnerability of forests were compared. Soil data was obtained via the Bavarian Landesamt für Umwelt (LFU) which provides shapefiles with soil cover information of Bavaria on a scale of 1:25.000. The data is conceptually derived from existing documents and was both evaluated and supplemented by field site inspections [45]. 2.1.4. Topographic DataA Digital Terrain Model (DTM) with a spatial resolution of 25 m was used as a basis for the topographic calculations. The DTM was obtained via the Bundesamt für Kartographie und Geodäsie (BKG) and was generated through different methods, including laser scanning, photogrammetry and digitization of contour lines [46]. 2.1.5. Remote Sensing DataRemote sensing data from the Landsat satellite mission and MODIS onboard the Terra satellite was utilized in this study. For Landsat data, atmospherically corrected Tier 1 Surface Reflectance (SR) imagery from the satellites Landsat-4, -5, -7 and -8 were used and combined. SR data provides atmospherically corrected imagery which accounts for noise effects such as thin clouds or aerosol scattering [42,43]. This results in better comparability between different scenes that cover the same region [52]. Thus, continuous optical remote sensing data since 1982 with a spatial resolution of 30 m was generated. The resolution of each Landsat scene was subsequently lowered by a factor of 2 in order to reduce the potential negative influence of pixel geolocation error uncertainties [53,54,55]. Therefore, Landsat data with a 60 m resolution was generated and used for drought response analyses.Complementary to Landsat imagery, the MODIS Terra MOD09A1 Version 6 product was included which provides atmospherically corrected SR data with a spatial resolution of 500 m and a temporal resolution of eight days [41]. Each pixel hereby represents the best possible observation within an eight-day time period [56]. By including both Landsat and MODIS imagery, the influence of spatial and temporal resolution for detecting the vegetation response could be compared.", 2. Material and Methods, 2.1. Materials,2

669," 2.2.1. Calculation of the Self-Calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI)Using the previously described meteorological data, the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI), which is based on the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) by Palmer [57], was derived as a meteorological drought reference. The PDSI is one of the most widely used drought indices to quantify long-term drought conditions. Instead of precipitation anomalies, the concept of the PDSI is based on a water supply-and-demand approach that makes it more comprehensive than precipitation-only indices [58]. A full description of the framework for this model can be found in Palmer [57], but we provide a brief overview of the procedure for estimating the PDSI here.For each month of the study period the four variables recharge (R), runoff (

The empirical constant with the value 17.67 in Equation (4) was derived by using data from nine locations across United States [57]. Multiplying the moisture departure d by K results in the anomaly index Z (Equation (5)) which in turn describes the wetness or dryness of a given month without the consideration to recent precipitation trends [59].

However, the model is being criticized for using empirical constants that were derived through a limited amount of samples and locations which makes a spatial comparison of PDSI values complicated, especially across different climatic regions [60]. Wells et al. [59] addressed this flaw for the scPDSI by replacing the empirical constants, in particular the empirically derived climatic characteristics K (Equation (4)) as well as the duration factors 0.897 and 

1
3

 (Equation (6)), with values that are dynamically calculated from the input data at a given location. The algorithm can be applied on continuous monthly weather data with a temporal coverage of at least 25 years [59]. The index was chosen as a meteorological drought reference since several studies demonstrated its good correlation to the status of forest ecosystems [29,61,62,63]. In order to calculate the scPDSI, the R package of the same name scPDSI v. 0.1.3 was applied which uses both precipitations as well as potential evapotranspiration as input data [64]. While precipitation data is available since the year 1881, data for the potential evapotranspiration is only available since 1991. Therefore, monthly scPDSI values were calculated for every pixel from January 1991 until December 2019. Table 2 categorizes the scPDSI values into different drought classes after Wells et al. [59]. Appendix A Figure A1 demonstrates an exemplary mean scPDSI time-series of the Steigerwald, a forest in northern Bavaria. 2.2.2. Cloud Masking and Calculation of Monthly Median Satellite ImagesIn order to reduce the effects of cloud contamination, the “pixel_qa” band of the Landsat SR product was used which provides a cloud, cloud shadow and snow mask based on the CFMask algorithm [43]. Similarly, the “StateQA“ layer of the MOD09A1 product was employed for removing clouds, cloud shadows and snow from the MODIS data [56].For better data comparability, monthly median images were computed for both Landsat and MODIS data. Since the aim of this study is to analyze changes in the spectral signal of vegetation as a response to extreme weather events, data values have to be as representative as possible in order to detect actual change instead of noise. Creating a median image for each month further reduces any noise leftovers within the data sets. The median, as a statistical parameter, has the advantage of being robust to outliers [65]. Furthermore, it facilitates comparability since a consistent temporal spacing between the values of all data sets is being realized. If only one scene was available for a given month, no median was computed but the single observation was used as a representation for that month. Moreover, any correlation analysis conducted in this study was only applied for months with available data. Therefore, in case there was no available data after cloud, cloud shadow and snow masking for a given month, said month was skipped during the correlation testing. 2.2.3. Calculation of Vegetation IndicesThe covered wavelengths of individual bands from different sensors are listed in Table 3 and visualized in Appendix A Figure A2. Three different vegetation indices were applied and compared in their ability to detect drought-related vegetation response.The first index is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) which is one of the most widely used vegetation indices. It was applied in numerous studies for vegetation health condition or greenness detection [68,69,70]. The NDVI is calculated using the red and Near Infrared (NIR) 1 band (Formula (7)) [71].

673,"Harmonic analyses were utilized for the identification of vegetation response to drought events. Complementary to the harmonic modeling, the well established z-score algorithm was applied as a second drought estimator based on the spectral behavior of vegetation which demonstrated its high potential as a drought and forest health index in several studies [29,84,85].Before applying any vegetation response analysis, the time-series data sets were detrended using a simple linear Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression approach that resulted in stationary data. Therefore, seasonal vegetational changes could be analyzed without the influence of a background trend [86,87]. Harmonic modeling and z-score computation were performed using GEE, since it provides the computational means necessary for carrying out this kind of analysis on a national scale. The GEE scripts for z-score computation and harmonic modeling are available on GitHub (https://github.com/MBalthasar/Harmonics_and_z-score_GEE_code) and may serve as a valuable tool for similar studies. 2.3.1. Harmonic ModellingTo calculate the harmonic fitted curve of a periodic signal, OLS regressions were computed using coupled sine and cosine curves on time-series data [33,88,89]. The first step was to calculate the time-difference between each time step and a reference date. Since GEE stores time information in units of unix time, which is the elapsed time since midnight 1 January 1970 in milliseconds [90], said the date was chosen as the reference date. The resulting difference values were subsequently converted to the temporal difference in fractal years t, followed by a conversion into radians.Depending on the number of cycles n that should be modeled per year, sine and cosine values of 1:n * radians were calculated. Afterwards, a multiple linear OLS regression calculation was performed with the respective vegetation index values as the dependent variable. The radians, sine and cosine values as well as a constant of 1 served as the independent variables. The regression analysis outputs a coefficient value 
β
 for each independent variable. The coefficient 

β
0

 for the added constant represents hereby the intercept value. After multiplying the independent variables with their respective coefficients based on the OLS regression, the sum of all independent values was calculated which resulted in the fitted value

. The underlying algorithm for the harmonic analysis is shown in Formula (10).As previously mentioned, different numbers of cycles per year can be modeled. The number of modeled cycles hereby defines the degree of the harmonic analysis. On the one hand, increasing the number of periodic signals per year can lead to more representative curves, especially if the original signal does not represent a perfect sinusoidal curve [91]. On the other hand, higher harmonic degrees tend to generate erroneous spikes and oscillations [92].In order to counteract this problem, the maximum harmonic degree was defined after the Nyquist-Shannon theorem. Said theorem originally addressed the discretization of analog signals and states that in order to reconstruct a signal, the sampling rate of the original signal has to be at least twice as high as its component with the highest frequency [93,94]. As mentioned by Ficker and Martišek [95], this minimum sampling rate is hereby commonly referred to as the Nyquist rate.Since time-series data in this study is based on monthly values, the sampling rate of the original signal equals twelve. With respect to the mentioned Nyquist rate, a maximum of six cycles per year can be modeled using this sampling strategy. In addition to the 6th degree harmonic model, a 1st and 3rd degree harmonic modeling approach was performed in order to compare and identify the harmonic degree that produces the highest quality results. A 3rd degree harmonic fitted curve refers hereby to the sum of 1–3 modeled cycles per year. A sixth degree harmonic model refers to the sum of 1–6 modeled cycles per year, respectively.Having modeled the harmonic fitted curve, it was interpreted as the ideal representation of the mean phenological dynamic throughout the year for each pixel. Therefore, in order to quantify the effects of drought events on the present vegetation, the deviation 
Δ
Harmonics of the original time-series values to the fitted curve were analyzed by subtracting the fitted values from the original ones. Lastly, a temporal subset using the months of May to October was created, since the focus of this study lies on drought analysis during the summer months.

While many studies commonly use the arithmetic mean as an average value for the z-score calculation [85,97], the median was chosen in this study as it is more robust to outliers compared to the arithmetic mean [98]. Since the phenological characteristics of vegetation vary between different months, a z-score computation for every month within a time-series data set was performed. Identical to the harmonic analysis, the final z-score time-series values were subsetted to only consist of data for the months May until October.

676,"As previously mentioned, the first level of analysis was dedicated to identifying the best predictor combination for analyzing vegetation response to drought on a national scale. For this purpose, only MODIS data was applied. 1000 random points across all German forest areas based on the CLC forest classification were hereby sampled and used to extract the values from satellite and meteorological time-series data. It was ensured that only one sample point per pixel was applied. Afterwards, correlation analyses were conducted for each sample point by using the Pearson method.All data were re-projected to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 32 north prior to any correlation testing. Furthermore, meteorological data was subsetted and resampled to match the temporal coverage and spatial resolution of MODIS data. Consequently, pixel values since 2000 until 2019 and with a 500 m spatial resolution were compared. Moreover, as already mentioned in Section 2.3.1 and Section 2.3.2, only the months May–October were considered for correlation testing because the focus of this study lies on the quantification of vegetation response to drought events during summer months. 2.4.1.

Δ
Harmonic and z-score values based on MODIS data were correlated against meteorological data, including scPDSI, maximum air temperature and the sum of precipitation per month. In addition, monthly soil moisture values were compared with remote sensing predictors. All three indices NDVI, NBR and NDMI were hereby investigated in order to identify the most potent vegetation index for drought assessment. Again, the 1000 sample points across German forests were used for correlation testing. Therefore, while a deviation between the vegetational and meteorological analysis is to be expected, the index with the overall highest correlation to meteorological predictors was identified to be most suitable for studying the vegetation response to drought.Correlation tests were conducted on a monthly and annual basis. For the annual analysis, the annual minimum value was applied in the case of the satellite data (NDVI, NBR, NDMI) as well as for the meteorological predictors scPDSI, precipitation and soil moisture. For maximum air temperature the annual maximum value was used. Since the vegetational response to drought events is analyzed, values for the three indices NDVI, NBR and NDMI as well as for the meteorological predictors scPDSI, precipitation and soil moisture are expected to be low during drought conditions, while maximum temperature is expected to be high during drought events in summer. Additionally, a temporal shift of 1–3 months and 1–3 years, respectively, was included to analyze a potential time lag between the meteorological drought and the vegetation response.Subsequently, monthly

679,"The second analysis level was dedicated to studying drought impact on different forest compositions. This includes the local dominant tree type, forest age as well as the present soil type and topographic parameters. The forest heatmap provided by the BaySF was hereby used as a mask. Only Landsat data was used for Analysis Level 2 since it provides the spatial resolution necessary to conduct detailed local investigations with such small-scale landscape heterogeneity. The most potent vegetation index and harmonic degree, as defined in Section 2.4.1 and Section 2.4.2, were utilized. Satellite imagery from August 2018 was used for drought analyses because the summer of 2018 featured heavy drought conditions and was therefore selected as a representative example. 2.5.1.

In general, highest correlation scores could be generated for the scPDSI (Figure 6), followed by soil moisture. For all meteorological predictors, using the NDVI resulted in the strongest correlations. In case of NDVI and NBR a temporal shift of three years achieved higher r scores compared to a one or two-year shift while at the same time the overall strongest correlation was still observed for NDVI without a temporal offset. Since choosing the NDVI led to the highest correlation values in the majority of scenarios, it was therefore considered to be the most potent vegetation index for vegetation analyses in the context of drought response.Spatial variability in correlation coefficients between scPDSI and MODIS NDVI z-score as well as scPDSI and MODIS NDVI

Harmonic numbers (close to 0) were generated for forest regions with fir as the dominant tree type.A comparison between the different forest ages reveals the three most vulnerable tree species (Pine, Larch and Oak) to be generally more heavily affected if forests are older than 80 years.

Harmonic NDVI values. After the “Bodenkundliche Kartieranleitung” (KA5), areas with the soil type “407a” are described to feature almost exclusively brown earth (including pseudogley) over loam or clay (sedimentary rock) with a surface layer of gravel-leading loam [100]. 3.2.3. Topographic Influence on Drought VulnerabilityFor topographic analyses, only areas that feature pine as the dominant tree type were used. Furthermore, the said area was masked to only cover regions with the previously identified five soils, which led to the lowest z-score and

Harmonic values (Table 4). That way, the influence of different dominant tree and soil types were reduced to a minimum for topographic investigations.Correlation analysis between remote sensing predictors and the topographic variable slope revealed a positive relationship of

691,"Remote sensing data derived from five different satellites were used within this study. Imagery from Landsat-4, -5, -7, -8 and MODIS Terra was applied. A single continuous Landsat product was generated by fusing data from the mentioned Landsat satellites and calculating monthly median images since 1984. Independent from the two analysis levels, the frequency of available data across Germany from both MODIS and Landsat was compared. For this purpose, Landsat imagery was resampled to match the spatial resolution of MODIS data (500 m) by using a bilinear interpolation approach. Landsat time-series was hereby further subsetted to match the temporal window of MODIS (since February 2000). Thus, the number of available monthly median scenes after cloud, cloud shadow and snow masking from February 2000 until December 2019 could be investigated on a per-pixel-basis.Different numbers of scenes are available depending on the satellite source. Landsat features both a higher spatial resolution and a longer temporal coverage compared to MODIS. Furthermore, since data from several Landsat missions were combined, the number of available Landsat images vary across time. A general increase in the number of cloud-, cloud shadow- and snow-free Landsat scenes since 1984 can be observed (Figure 10). With the launch of Landsat-5 in 1999, imagery from two Landsat satellites were available at the same time from that point on forward. This resulted in an overall increase in available data. However, between the last available SR data from Landsat-5 in May 2012 and the start of Landsat-8 in February 2013, imagery from only one satellite, Landsat-7, was available [42,43]. Moreover, the Scan Line Corrector (SLC) of the Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensor failed on 31 May 2003 [101]. This led to wedge-shaped scan gaps within the satellite imagery and therefore reduced the amount of available data. Calculating monthly median images should largely account for this issue but effectively there was still fewer data available for this time span.In contrast to Landsat data, MODIS imagery features a higher temporal frequency and a more consistent spatial coverage (Figure 11 and Figure 12), but at the cost of a lower spatial resolution. A higher number of available images per month increases the chances of having one or more cloud-free observations and therefore having more robust and representative median calculations. Landsat data features lower data continuity and a higher noise level compared to MODIS which can be attributed to the lower temporal resolution. The available cloud, cloud shadow and snow masks in the “pixel_qa” quality-band of the Landsat SR products are derived from the CFMask algorithm [43]. In a recent study by Foga et al. [102], the performance of different cloud masking algorithms were validated on a total of 96 globally distributed Landsat-8 scenes. The CFMask algorithm featured hereby the best overall accuracy results for both cloud detection (roughly 90%) and cloud shadow detection (roughly 96%) [102]. Known issues of the CFMask are the detection of clouds over bright surfaces, the detection of clouds for areas with temperature differentials that are either too small or too large between the clouds and the surrounding surface as well as the detection of optically thin clouds [43]. Despite these known issues, which could potentially impair the quality of the Landsat time-series, we consider the use of the cloud, cloud shadow and snow masks generated by the CFMask algorithm to be a reasonable choice as recommended by Foga et al. [102].Figure 12 illustrates the number of months with available imagery since the year 2000 across Germany. MODIS data features an overall higher and more homogeneous data frequency (Figure 12c). Contrary to that, Landsat imagery shows distinct stripes across Germany with lower data availability (Figure 12b). Areas of low data frequency overlap with the “gaps” of the Worldwide Reference System (WRS) tiles due to the positioning of the Landsat orbit footprints (Figure 12a). As a result of the northward increasing overlap of Landsat orbits, a more consistent data availability in northern Germany can be observed compared to southern Germany.As seen in Table 3 and Appendix A Figure A2, bands of the different sensors Thematic Mapper (TM) (Landsat-4 and -5), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) (Landsat-7) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) (Landsat-8) slightly deviate in their covered wavelength areas. It also has to be mentioned that different SR processing algorithms are applied for different Landsat products. Namely, the Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) algorithm is used for Landsat-4, -5 and -7, whereas the Land Surface Reflectance Code (LaSRC) is applied for Landsat-8 imagery [42,43]. Both algorithms produce similar results, but utilize different methods for generating SR products [103]. Furthermore, spectral bands of MODIS imagery also feature differences in spectral wavelength coverage compared to Landsat sensors (Table 3). Time-series analyses within this study were based on the normalized indices NDVI, NBR and NDMI. Therefore, differences in spectral coverage are expected to be averaged out for the most part.With the launch of the Landsat-8 satellite in 2013, earlier studies dedicated their research effort to the comparison between NDVI values generated by different Landsat sensors. Results of these studies show slightly higher NDVI values for Landsat-8 data compared to Landsat-7 imagery, while a high degree of similarity between the two sensors was stated especially for areas of high vegetation density, such as forests [104,105]. Within this context, Roy et al. [106] suggested a simple linear OLS regression equation for both Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) and SR data, in order to convert Landsat-8 NDVI products to match Landsat-7 and vice versa [106]. While the quality of time-series investigation could have potentially increased by introducing a regression equation, no such regression was applied during this study since only areas with a high vegetation density (forests) were analyzed for which the difference in NDVI was found to be close to 0 [105]. In another study done by Zhang and Roy [107], inconsistencies within a 27-year NDVI time-series using Landsat-5 data were examined. Linear regression analysis revealed a minor negative trend due to changes in orbit positioning [107]. No correction to these inconsistencies was performed on Landsat-5 data within this study which might have further increased the comparability between different Landsat data sets.", 4.

Δ
Harmonic NDVI values derived from MODIS data were correlated against scPDSI and z-score values using the 1st, 3rd and 6th harmonic degree. As seen in Figure 4, increasing the harmonic degree resulted in overall higher correlation scores, with the 6th degree of harmonic performing best out of all tested degrees. Similar results were demonstrated in a study by Wilson et al. [33], who correlated a harmonic time-series using the 1st to 4th degree against national forest inventory data. The root-mean-square error (RMSE) hereby decreased with an increasing harmonic degree [33]. Improvements in correlation scores were greater between the 1st and 3rd degree, compared to the 3rd and 6th degree. This mirrors results of other studies which suggest 90 percent of variations in time-series of vegetation phenology is explained by the first three harmonic degrees [34,108].Figure 4 further demonstrates significantly higher r scores between z-score and 
Δ
Harmonic values compared to correlation scores between 
Δ
Harmonic and scPDSI. This exemplifies that the vulnerability of a forest is not only dependent on meteorological conditions but, as also mentioned by Sykes [1], on other additional biotic and abiotic factors such as water availability, available nutrients, forest composition, forest age, topographic positioning or pest infestation. That said, scPDSI data generated the overall highest correlation scores out of all meteorological predictors, followed by soil moisture. Maximum air temperature featured the lowest r values. Similar findings were observed in a study by Scharnweber et al. [62], who used tree ring data to estimate past climatic variability and correlated the tree ring data against meteorological values in north-eastern Germany. The highest correlation scores were hereby achieved by using the scPDSI, followed by soil moisture and precipitation, whereas temperature featured the overall weakest correlation [62]. Another study by Büntgen et al. [61] compared tree ring information of oak trees in central Germany with meteorological drought. scPDSI outperformed temperature data, for which no significant correlations were found [61]. While some studies demonstrated good correlation results between remote sensing and temperature data in other climatic regions (e.g., [109,110]), results derived from previous studies related to German forests as well as results generated within this study suggest both soil moisture and in particular scPDSI to be among the most potent meteorological drought predictors for similar climatic regions.The vegetation index NDVI performed best in most scenarios and was therefore recognized as the most potent index for quantifying vegetation response to drought events within the framework of this study. Although the NDMI is considered to be a good indicator for vegetation moisture content and also featured significant correlation scores to meteorological predictors, it was not able to surpass the performance of the NDVI. While in a previous study by Gu et al. [111] the NDMI values exhibited a quicker response to drought conditions than NDVI in grasslands, our results suggest that using the NDVI, which reflects the photosynthetic activity and vitality of a plant by including the red band in addition to the NIR band [71], is a better proxy for assessing the vegetation response to drought events for forest canopies.Investigations related to temporal offsets between meteorological conditions and vegetational response revealed generally the strongest correlation without any offset. That said, for annual imagery a temporal offset of three years resulted in slightly higher overall r scores compared to a one year offset for NDVI and NBR correlated against scPDSI (Figure 6), while highest correlation was still generated for NDVI without any time lag. The two previously mentioned studies by Büntgen et al. [61] and Scharnweber et al. [62] also identified worse correlation results for a one-year offset. In contrast, another study by Chuai et al. [112] dedicated their analysis to the relationships between NDVI, precipitation and temperature in Inner Mongolia, China. Significant time-lag effects between the spring and summer season were hereby identified for precipitation, but no effects could be observed for temperature [112]. Using longer temporal shifts as the ones applied in this study could potentially lead to higher correlation results.A high spatial variability in correlation values between meteorological drought and the response of vegetation could be observed (Figure 7). Other studies also described strong variations in r scores between remote sensing and meteorological data across different climatic districts and vegetation types [112,113]. Such correlation maps provide valuable information on the degree of relationship between meteorological and vegetation data across space. Therefore, areas that are more dependable on climatic conditions can be distinguished from areas that are less sensitive to extreme meteorological events, e.g., drought. In general, a significant relationship between meteorological conditions and vegetation response could be observed. However, the varying degree of correlation strength demonstrates that the health status of a forest is not only dependent on the current meteorological condition, but, as previously mentioned, on a combination of various biotic and abiotic factors.Overall higher correlation scores could be achieved by using the z-score method when comparing meteorological drought with vegetation response. However, correlation analysis between remote sensing data and the topographical predictor slope suggests higher performance for the 
Δ
Harmonic approach. While both methods generated results that are strongly correlated to each other, distinct differences in the results of the two algorithms could be observed throughout this study. Quality assessment for the two presented methods (z-score and 
Δ
Harmonics) as well as for the different remote sensing data sets (MODIS and Landsat) is limited due to the absence of in-situ drought quantification data. As mentioned by Pause et al. [6] and Lausch et al. [21], in-situ sampling data is required for adding value to physical observations based on satellite data and for interlinking forest health with abiotic and biotic parameters. That said, the authors further mention that in-situ observations vary in type, quality and quantity, which in turn hinders the exploitation for satellite-based analyses. A standardization of drought-related ground truth data is, therefore, a key aspect for improving our understanding of the connection between spectral response and forest health status [6,21].", 4.

693,"Studying the response of different tree types to drought conditions in August 2018 revealed the weakest susceptibility to drought for fir, spruce and beech trees (Figure 9). Both, fir and beech trees are often considered to be resistant and resilient future tree types in the face of climate change-induced extreme weather events [4]. Spruce, on the other hand, as a shallow-rooted tree, is commonly described to be strongly prone to drought and windfalls [114]. Furthermore, spruce trees in many forests are strongly affected by bark beetle infestations which led to large-scale felling of infected trees [114,115]. No information about pest infestation was included within the framework of this study which might have increased the comparability of different tree species in their drought vulnerability. It must also be stressed that the included reference data of dominant tree types is limited in its spatial extent by only having information about selected Bavarian forest regions (Figure 2). Results for German-wide analyses might differ due to varying local and regional climatic conditions and soil properties, as suggested by the main natural units after Schmithüsen and Meynen [99]). On the other hand, the strongest negative response to drought events were observed for forest areas with pine or larch as the dominant tree type. Large-scale dying of pine stands after long droughts in German forests matches these results [14]. Pine forests are further troubled by fungal infestations of Sphaeropsis sapinea, causing dieback of affected trees [116,117]. As already mentioned, no information about pest infestation was included for the user-reference data. Larch trees were also identified to be among the most vulnerable tree types. While the European larch is widely used in intensive breeding programs due to its fast growth rate and high wood quality [118], recent studies identified a high vulnerability to low soil moisture contents and drought events, especially in mountainous and alpine regions [119,120,121].Somewhat divided results in vulnerability were observed for different forest ages depending on the dominant tree type. On the one hand, the generally more susceptible tree types pine, larch and oak demonstrated a general higher vulnerability to drought in forest stands which are older than 80 years. On the other hand, the impact of forest age on less vulnerable tree types proved to be weaker. In a study by Bottero et al. [122], the vulnerability of forest ecosystems depending on, amongst other factors, stand age was studied. Drought was hereby independent of the age of a forest [122]. Drought vulnerability also increases the risk of forest fires [20]. In case of boreal forest regions, the probability of burning events is generally assumed to be independent of forest age [123]. However, some studies suggest an increase in burning probability until the age 50 [124,125]. That said, only forest ages older or younger than 80 years were compared during this study. A lower age threshold might thereby lead to more distinct differences.It also has to be mentioned that only the dominant tree type of a given forest area was provided. No information about other tree types and their proportions in a given area was available. Lastly, since only the dominant tree type of an area is known, no information about intra-specific variations within one tree type were studied.The impact of different soils was studied using only one dominant tree type. Thus, the influence of various tree species on soil-dependent drought vulnerability analysis was reduced to a minimum. Pine was hereby selected since it proved to be one of the most responsive trees to drought conditions (Figure 9) and at the same time covered a fairly large area compared to other sensitive tree types within the reference data set. Results revealed all five soil classes which led to the lowest z-score and 
Δ
Harmonic values to feature sandy components (Table 4). The same results could also be observed for the whole forest heatmap area. In contrast, soil type “407a” led to least negative z-score and 
Δ
Harmonic values. This soil type differs from the soils mentioned in Table 4 by having a higher amount of brown earth and no explicitly described sandy components [100]. In the previously mentioned study by Reif et al. [4], forests on sandy soils were also described to be heavily endangered. Pine trees are generally considered to be undemanding in terms of soil quality and are therefore able to grow on e.g., sandy locations better compared to other competing tree types [126]. However, in terms of drought conditions, different soil types can have a significant influence on the vulnerability of pine trees as seen in this study.Correlation analysis between remote sensing predictors and the topographic parameter slope revealed a positive correlation which suggests less severe drought response on slopes. A possible reason for this behavior could be the potential redistribution of soil moisture content along a hillslope gradient. In a recent study by Hawthorne and Miniat [127], higher soil moisture content at the cove area of a plot was observed. Hence, topography might have mitigated drought effects especially in lower slope positions [127]. That said, no attention was given to the slope position along a gradient, but only the degree of the slope was considered within this study. Moreover, the majority of pixels feature slopes of 15


∘

 or less. Further analyses on steeper slopes and with respect to the position on a slope gradient are recommended for future studies.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Analysis Level 2: Forest Type Vulnerability,4
694,"Within this study, the potential of harmonic modeling and z-score standardization for detecting and quantifying vegetation response of forest ecosystems to drought events was analyzed via satellite remote sensing data. Both approaches generated results that were strongly correlated to each other, but featured slight differences in their performance when correlating against meteorological and topographical data. While the overall performance of the z-score was higher when comparing to meteorological predictors, 
Δ
Harmonic values showed stronger relationships to topographical data. Out of all meteorological data, soil moisture and in particular the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI) demonstrated the strongest correlations, with maximum air temperature data featuring the weakest relationships to vegetation response. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery provided more consistent and less noisy data in comparison to Landsat, but is limited by both its temporal coverage and its relatively low spatial resolution. Out of the three vegetation indices used, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) led to overall best results in terms of drought-related spectral response. Pine and larch trees were identified to feature the strongest negative response to drought events, especially pine trees on sandy soils. Lower drought vulnerability was observed for higher slope degrees, potentially caused by a redistribution of the soil moisture content. Both the z-score and 
Δ
Harmonic modeling using a 6th harmonic degree in combination with monthly MODIS NDVI data can be recommended for similar studies on large scales. In particular, the generated maps which display the correlation strength between satellite-derived vegetation indices and meteorological data provide valuable information on the vulnerability of vegetation to extreme weather conditions across space. The proposed methods and data allow for a near real-time observation of vegetation response of German forests to extreme weather events, such as drought, and can, therefore, be used as a tool for risk reduction. Nevertheless, for further evaluation and detailed quality assessment of the presented methods and data, standardized, nationwide and drought-related in situ measurements are required.", 5.

695,"The world’s tropical forests are essential places for environmental sustainability and the future of our planet. They combine high biodiversity and significant carbon storage with ecological services [1,2]. Since the 1980s, the world’s tropical forests have undergone substantial change. Agricultural expansion worldwide happened at the expense of tropical forest areas [3]. In particular, the Brazilian Amazon rain forest has suffered significant deforestation. According to Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research (INPE), deforestation has reached 20% of the Amazon rain forest in the country [4]. Producing qualified assessments of land-use and land cover change in Amazonia is essential for evidence-based policies that can protect the forest [5,6].Earth observation data is the primary source of assessments of deforestation in Amazonia. Since the late 1980s, INPE produces annual estimates of clear-cut areas of forest with the PRODES project and daily indications of deforestation alerts with the DETER initiative [7]. PRODES and DETER are the authoritative sources of information that support Brazil’s actions in protecting Amazonia [8,9]. As a companion to the monitoring of clear-cut areas, INPE and its partners also produce periodic maps of land-use change in deforested areas in Amazonia with the TerraClass project [10]. Universities and research groups complement INPE’s work [11,12]. Altogether, there is a substantial amount of land-use change information on the Brazilian Amazonia derived from remote sensing data.Despite the widespread data availability, the complexity of land-use transitions in Amazonia requires continuous improvements in image classification. Law enforcement actions by the Brazilian federal government managed to reduce deforestation from 2.7 Mha (million hectares) in 2004 to an average of 0.6 Mha between 2009 and 2018. Despite such reduction, deforestation in Amazonia is still at a relatively high level. To understand the complex interplay between crop production, cattle ranching, and land speculation, ever more detailed data is required.To improve monitoring of the Amazon forest from satellites, researchers are investigating the use of big data analytics [13,14]. Such methods rely on the increase of data provided by the new generation of satellites such as Sentinel–2 [15]. However, to use these large data sets in tropical forest areas, researchers need suitable methods of automated cloud detection in optical imagery.Traditional alternatives for dealing with cloud cover include combining information from various dates and selecting a “best pixel” for an extended period [16]. These methods lead to the loss of temporal information required to identify crop types [14,17] and pasture management [18,19]. To capture temporal information, many researchers prefer methods that identify cloud-covered pixels and replace them with interpolated estimates [20]. When different satellites are combined to produce a denser time series [21], replacing cloudy pixels by interpolated values becomes feasible. For this reason, automated cloud detection algorithms are a necessary complement to big Earth observation data analytics.Cloud detection algorithms are an active research field [20,22,23,24,25]. Each algorithm has specific characteristics and ad hoc techniques; thus, comparing them on a theoretical basis is hard. In practice, performance assessment is done by selecting representative images and assessing how well each algorithm performs in each image. As an example, Baetens et al. [26] compared three cloud detection methods (MAJA, Sen2Cor, and Fmask) using 32 images from 10 different locations. As a reference for comparison, the authors use a machine learning method to identify clouds for Sentinel–2 images. Given the different land cover, the diversity of sensors, and the advances in detection methods, such comparisons serve as general guidance only.In this paper, we approach the problem of comparing different cloud detection algorithms from a regional viewpoint. Given the importance of monitoring land change in Amazonia, we consider cloud detection methods for Sentinel-2 MSI images in this region. We consider four cloud detection algorithms: Fmask 4 [25], MAJA [23], Sen2Cor 2.8 [22], and s2cloudless [27]. Cloud formation in Amazonia is distinct from most continental areas [28]. The forest produces its own rain [29]. The rainforest generates the aerosols that make up the cloud condensation nucleus in the region [30]. The probabilities of cloud coverage in satellite imagery depend not only on the month of the year but also on the location inside Amazonia [31]. Cloud types are heterogeneous in the Amazon biome; the southern region of the Amazonia has high aerosol concentration, whereas the northern and northwestern regions have low aerosol concentration and high precipitation [30,32]. These characteristics indicate different processes in cloud formation in subregions of the Amazon biome.During the wet season, the precipitating clouds in the Amazon basin are either low-level stratus type clouds (up to 2–5 km altitude) or high-level convective systems (more than 6 km altitude) [30]. The different land cover influences the amount and type of clouds. Deep clouds are commonly found over the forest while shallow clouds are frequent over deforested areas [33,34]. Water bodies absorb visible and near-infrared radiation diminishing the reflectivity of the thin clouds above [35]. The high reflectivity of artificial surfaces induces commission errors in cloud detection over urban areas [36]. Such differences pose a challenge for cloud detection algorithms in Amazonia; they need to consider many types of cloud formations and associated shadows. These singular characteristics suggest that it is useful to take images over Amazonia as a study case when comparing cloud detection methods.The rest of this article is organized as follows. We first introduce the study area and the sample regions. Then we present the cloud detection algorithms and how we configured them. Later we show how the classes resulting from each cloud detection algorithm compares to the others. Finally, we introduce our results and then we discuss some implications of this work.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
696,"The Amazon forest covers half of Brazil (49.3%) and provides four-fifths of its groundwater (81%) with an average rainfall of approximately 2300 mm per year [37]. Persistent cloud cover in Amazonia is a significant limitation for deforestation monitoring by satellite. Using the Landsat archive from 1984 to 1997, Asner [31] shows how the probability of cloud cover on Landsat images depends not only on the month of the year but also on its location inside Amazonia. From June to August, the chance of finding one image with less than 30% cloud cover is 60–90% in southeastern Amazonia. In the southwestern part, cloud cover is persistent all year round. While the recent availability of medium-resolution (10–100 m) sensors with higher temporal frequency than Landsat has improved the chances of obtaining cloud-free pixels, cloud cover in rain forests such as Amazonia will always be a challenge for optical remote sensing.", 2.

697,"This study uses images from the Sentinel–2A satellite, launched in 2015. The satellite is part of the Copernicus Earth Observation program of the European Union, which is operated by the European Space Agency (ESA) and managed by the European Commission. It carries the Multispectral Instrument (MSI), which detects 13 bands of the electromagnetic spectrum spanning from the visible to the short infrared (SWIR) wavelengths at spatial resolutions of 10 m, 20 m, and 60 m, with a revisit period of 10 days [15] (see Table 1). MSI’s three bands at 60 m resolution are dedicated to atmospheric correction and cloud screening, leaving ten bands for land observation [38]. Sentinel-2A data enables researchers to explore the changes on Earth’s surface due to its open data access policy and its temporal, spatial, and spectral resolutions.To assess cloud detection algorithms over Amazonia, we chose five areas representative of its climate heterogeneity. We identify them using the tiling system of Sentinel–2:T19LFK: Covers part of the states of Acre and Amazonas, including an indigenous land (Terra Indígena Apurianã) and a protected area (Reserva Extrativista Chico Mendes). The region is associated with significant recent deforestation.T20NPH: This area is in the state of Roraima and it partially covers a national forest (Floresta Nacional de Roraima) and an indigenous land (Terra Indígena Yanomami).T21LXH: This area covers part of the state of Mato Grosso; it includes fragmented forest areas, soybean crops, pasture, and water reservoirs.T22MCA: In the state of Para, this area overlaps various indigenous reserves (Arara, Araweté, Kararaô, Koatinemo, and Trincheira) and part of a conservation unit; most of the area is covered by native forest with some deforested areas to the North.T22NCG: This area is in the state of Amapá, including part of a National Forest (Amapá), a national park (Montanhas do Tumucumaque), and an indigenous land (Waiãpi).Tiles T21LXH and T18LFK represent areas where most of the deforestation in Amazonia occurred since the 1970s. Tile T21LXH is a hotspot of Brazil’s agricultural frontier with a well-defined dry season from July to September. Tile T18LFK is under the direct influence of the urban area of Rio Branco, the capital of Acre, including both deforestation and protected areas. Deforestation has increased recently in the region of tile T22MCA, threatening indigenous lands. Unlike the others, tiles T20NPH and T22NCG are in the Northern hemisphere, where the seasons and cloud patterns differ from areas to the south of the Equator. Tile T22NCG has much cloud cover all year round and low deforestation. Tile T20NPH overlaps forest and natural savanna, where emerging mining activities are menacing indigenous territories (Figure 1).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Data Selection,2
698,"The paper compares four algorithms: Fmask 4 [25], MAJA [23], Sen2Cor 2.8 [22], and S2cloudless [27]. Fmask 4 and s2cloudless are specific for cloud detection. MAJA and Sen2Cor 2.8 are image processors; they generate cloud masks as part of image conversion from radiance at the top of the atmosphere to reflectance from ground targets. To process Landsat 8 data, USGS uses a version of the Fmask method that requires the thermal band [40]. Fmask 4 is a version of Fmask that has been adjusted to be used with sensors without thermal bands. ESA uses Sen2Cor to process Sentinel–2 images. MAJA is developed by CNES and is used by applications such as Sen2Agri [41]. The Sentinel Hub uses S2cloudless for the fast generation of cloud masks [27]. These methods represent the latest generation of cloud detection algorithms for optical remote sensing images.Fmask 4 [25] is the most recent version of Fmask [20]. Earlier versions of Fmask required a thermal band and worked only on Landsat images. The latest version also works on Sentinel–2 images [25]. To distinguish between clouds and bright surfaces in Landsat 8 images, Fmask 4 uses the thermal band. In the case of Sentinel–2 images, it takes the view angle parallax of the NIR bands [24]. To reduce false positives resulting from snow and built-up areas, Fmask 4 uses spectral and contextual features. To distinguish land from water, it relies on global surface water map [42]. Fmask 4 matches clouds with their shadows based on similarity. It iterates cloud height from a minimum to a maximum level; for each possible height, it computes the similarity between cloud and cloud shadows [43]. When processing Sentinel–2 images, its cloud and cloud shadow masks have a 20 m resolution [25].Sen2Cor processes Sentinel–2 data to estimate Bottom-Of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectances from Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) data [22]. It takes Level-1C images and adjusts for atmospheric effects, generating Level-2A surface reflectance products [22,39]. It generates two types of results: (1) atmospheric correction products, such as aerosol optical thickness, surface reflectance, and water vapor maps; and (2) cloud screening and scene Classification (SCL), which assigns a class to each pixel. Sen2Cor provides two quality indicators: A cloud confidence map and a snow confidence map with values ranging from 0 to 100%. The distinction between cloudy, clear and water pixels in the SCL and the output of the cloud confidence map are used to produce the cloud confidence information [39]. The current version of Sen2Cor (2.8) increases the accuracy of classification on water, urban, and bare areas while reducing false positives for snow. Other improvements include cirrus detection, false cloud detection due to permanent bright targets, classification of water pixels inside of cloud borders, and discrimination between topographic and cloud shadow pixels [44].Sentinel Hub’s S2cloudless is a machine-learning-based cloud detector [27]. Its input is Level-1C top of atmosphere data from 10 Sentinel–2 bands (bands 1-5 and 8-12) combined with pairwise band differences and band ratios. It uses the LightGBM algorithm [45] trained over multiple clouded and non-clouded samples over the world. As training data, is uses cloud masks provided by MAJA as a proxy for ground truth. S2cloudless trained its classification model with

 Sentinel–2 tiles from 596 geographically unique areas in 77 different countries.MAJA (MACCS–ATCOR Joint Algorithm) combines two methods: (a) the Multi-sensor Atmospheric Correction and Cloud Screening (MACCS) and (b) the Atmospheric and Topographic Correction (ATCOR). It builds on these methods by including time-series of images to improve detection of reflectance changes due to clouds [46]. The method assumes that surface reflectances without clouds are stable in time, while clouds or cloud shadows result in quick variations [23]. MAJA uses multi-temporal images that contain the most recent cloud-free observation for each pixel. At each new image, the algorithm updates this composite with the newly-available cloud-free pixels. Thus, it processes the data for a given location in chronological order [26]. The algorithm needs to be initialized to fix cases where a given pixel has no cloud-free observations. To cover these specific cases, MAJA also uses a mono-temporal criterion based only on spectral information [23].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Cloud Detection Algorithms,2
699,"To run Fmask 4, MAJA 3.2.2, and Sen2Cor 2.8, we used Linux Docker containers. The Fmask 4 implementation uses the MATLAB code available at GitHub (https://github.com/GERSL/Fmask). For Sen2Cor 2.8, we installed the version provided by ESA (https://step.esa.int/main/third-party-plugins-2/sen2cor/). The MAJA implementation was obtained from CNES (https://logiciels.cnes.fr/fr/content/maja). We downloaded S2cloudless 1.4.0 from the Sentinel Hub (https://www.sentinel-hub.com/). Run-time parameters are described below.Fmask 4: Dilation parameters for cloud, cloud shadows, and snow were set to 3, 3, and 0 pixels, respectively. The cloud probability threshold was 20%, following Qiu et al. [47].S2cloudless: Cloud probability threshold was set to 70%, using a four-pixel convolution for averaging cloud probabilities and dilation of two pixels, following the parameters set by Zupanc et al. [27].Sen2Cor 2.8: The tests used the same configuration as that of the Land Cover maps of ESA’s Climate Change Initiative (http://maps.elie.ucl.ac.be/CCI/viewer/download.php).MAJA: The evaluation used the same configuration as that of the Sen2Agri application (http://www.esa-sen2agri.org).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Algorithm Configuration,2
700,"To validate the resulting cloud masks, we used sample points tagged by remote sensing experts through visual interpretation, following the work of Foga et al. and Zhu et al. [36,40]. We selected a set of random locations inside each Sentinel–2 tile. Since Sentinel–2 images at 10 m resolution have over 120 million pixels, standard statistical techniques indicate that using about 400 samples per image is enough to achieve a 95% confidence level with a 5% margin of error [48]. Five experts labeled those points in all 20 images. The labels were “cloud”, “cloud shadow”, “clear”, and “other”. The “other” label is a placeholder for samples that the experts could not tag. Since the areas of cloud shadow are small compared to other labels, we tried to ensure there were at least 50 samples of cloud shadows. Two different experts classified each point; only those where both experts agreed were selected. Because of the need for agreement between experts, the final number of selected samples changes from image to image (see Table 2).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Validation Sample Set,2
701,"Since the algorithms tested use different labels, we recoded their results to match the labels in the validation sample set. In particular, MAJA produces an 8-bit mask, so that many labels can be applied to a pixel, allowing combinations that are not available in the results of other algorithms. For example, MAJA’s mask allows tagging a pixel as a shadow projected on top of a cloud from another cloud in a neighboring image. To make MAJA’s more detailed results compatible with the output of the other methods, we prioritize clouds over cloud shadows and cloud shadows over clear pixels. Table 3 shows how the original codes for each method were relabelled for compatibility.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.6. Label Compatibility,2
702,"To compare the results of the algorithms, we use the F1 score [49] and the user’s, producer’s, and overall accuracies [50]. The F1 score (Equation (1)) is the harmonic mean of the precision (Equation (2)) and recall rates (Equation (3)). The producer’s accuracy measures how well a certain label has been classified. It is computed by dividing the correctly classified pixels in each class by the total number of pixels of the corresponding class. The user’s accuracy indicates the probability that prediction represents reality. It is computed by dividing the correctly classified pixels in each label by the total number of pixels classified in that label. The overall accuracy indicates the quality of the map classification. It is calculated by dividing the total number of correctly classified pixels by the total number of reference pixels.

703,"In our experiments, Fmask 4 has the best overall accuracy, followed by Sen2Cor, MAJA, and S2cloudless (see Table 4). Fmask 4 consistently outperforms the other algorithms in overall, user’s and producer’s accuracies for all classes. It also has the best results considering individual tiles. For cloud shadow detection, Fmask 4 has a better performance than Sen2Cor. Although MAJA has the ability to detect cloud shadows, in practice the methods extend its cloud mask to include shadows. MAJA is a conservative method that uses dilation operators to improve the user’s accuracy of the clear sky. Therefore, no shadows are reported by MAJA. This is observable in either the images themselves or Figure 2, in which MAJA consistently detects more cloud pixels than the other methods. Furthermore, Fmask 4 and Sen2Cor also distinguish cirrus clouds from clouds, as shown in Figure 2. For accuracy assessment, we merged both types of clouds for computing the information in Table 4 and Table 5 to be able to compare Fmask 4 and Sen2Cor with the other methods.When comparing the overall accuracy of Sen2Cor with that of MAJA, their design choices stand out. MAJA has a better user’s accuracy for clear sky pixels than Sen2Cor; for producer’s accuracy of this class, Sen2Cor is superior. Conversely, MAJA has a better producer’s accuracy than Sen2Cor for cloud pixels; for the user’s accuracy, the situation is inverted. This situation also holds in individual tiles (see Table 5). The designers of MAJA have chosen to maximize the probability that pixels labeled as a clear sky are correct.The behavior of S2cloudless is erratic; sometimes it produces results visually similar to those of Fmask 4 or Sen2Cor (see Figure 3), while in some other occasions it misclassifies clear pixels as clouds (see Figure 2). For example, for tile T21LXH on 28 March 2017 and tile T22MCA on 28 June 2018, S2cloudless has a particularly poor performance. Figure 4 shows tile T21LXH on 28 March 2017, a case where S2cloudless performs differently from the other methods.These results showed that the four algorithms produce their best results on images with few well-defined (crisp) clouds. Except for s2cloudless, the algorithms agree on the shape and the number of areas classified as either cloud or clear. However, they cannot adequately approximate the shape of clouds and their shadows on thin semi-transparent cirrus or tightly packed clouds (see Figure 5). The accurate detection of cloud shadows is challenging because dark surfaces, such as wetlands, burned areas, and terrain shadows can be easily confused with cloud shadows [25].The pictures shown in Figure 4 confirm the results discussed above. While Fmask4 has the best performance, it is interesting to compare MAJA with Sen2Cor. MAJA uses squircles (i.e., a shape between a circle and a rectangle) to fill in the cloud shape, ensuring the total coverage of each cloud in detriment of cloud shadows. Thus, MAJA sometimes incorporates clear pixels in its cloud mask, as also reported by [26]. By contrast, Sen2Cor approximates the shape of the cloud from the inside, filling in the clouds’ boundaries with saturated labels—particularly with thin cirrus clouds—which produces rough borders (see Figure 5). Furthermore, Sen2Cor cannot detect small clouds which are correctly identified by Fmask 4 and MAJA (e.g., see the small clouds at the center of Figure 3).The shadow masks produced by Fmask 4 are displaced regarding to the shadows visible in the images. This is a consequence of the coarse spatial resolution of the digital elevation model used by the method. As for their shapes, Fmask 4 matches well the cloud shadows respect to the clouds producing them, while in Sen2Cor the cloud shadows have smoother and different boundaries than their clouds (see Figure 5). Our results confirm the work of Qiu et al. [25] and Baetens et al. [26], who report that Fmask 4 works better in detecting clouds and cloud shadows than Sen2Cor for Sentinel–2A images.We could not compute the accuracies for cloud shadow detection for MAJA and S2cloudless. This is expected from s2cloudless but it comes as a surprise in the case of MAJA. An explanation is MAJA’s greedy behavior regarding clouds; it tends to tag pixels as clouds in disregard of their shadows (see Figure 2). An alternative explanation is due to our interpretation of the MAJA’s bit mask where we prioritized clouds over cloud shadows (see Section 2.6).Sen2Cor tags many pixels as saturated, defective, or unclassified which we labelled as other (see Table 3). A visual inspection reveals most of the saturated pixels are the external border of clouds (see Figure 3). On the other hand, Sen2Cor in tile T21LXH for 08 March 2017 (see Figure 4) mistakenly displays cloud and cloud shadow pixels along the riverbank, almost perfectly profiling the whole river; this could be caused by suspended matter in the water. Sen2Cor problems to detect cloud cover over water were also reported by [25,51]. As discussed above, the shapes of clouds in the Sen2Cor mask are rougher compared to the smoother results using the other algorithms. Despite these issues, Sen2Cor is a reliable method for cloud detection. Its producer’s accuracies for clear sky and clouds are respectively 89% and 88%. If its errors in detecting cloud shadows can be tolerated by the user, its efficiency and ease of use may justify its choice for bulk processing.S2cloudless erratically mixes land features and clouds, particularly on images with few clouds. It does not spot cloud shadows. We could not confirm the claims made by the authors of this method [27] about the good performance of this algorithm. One explanation is that the clouds in tropical forests such as Amazonia are not adequately included in the S2cloudless training set.", 3. Results,None,3
704,"The results of this study show that the Fmask 4 algorithm consistently performs better than the alternatives for Sentinel-2 images of the Amazon rain forest. Fmask 4 had an overall accuracy of 90%, followed by Sen2Cor (79%), MAJA (69%) and s2cloudless (52%). Our results are different from those of Baetens et al. [26] who concluded that MAJA and Fmask 4 perform similarly with an overall accuracy around 90%, while Sen2Cor had an overall accuracy of 84%. We now consider some hypothesis that could account for such significant differences.As noted by Baetens et al. [26], for satellites without thermal bands cloud detection methods use thresholds. Different thresholds are set for the visible bands, the 

1.38

 band, and the Normalized Difference Snow Index. These approximations address important challenges for cloud detection methods: distinguishing clouds from snow, mountain tops, bright deserts, and large built-up objects. Since each cloud detection method relies on different ad hoc hypotheses, its usefulness varies from scene to scene. For this reason, no single study can provide definitive guidance. Studies that target specific regions, such as the current paper, provide valuable advice even though its results cannot be generalized to non-forest areas.The comparison done by Baetens et al. [26] uses 10 different sites, including equatorial forests, deserts and semi-deserts, agricultural areas, mountains, and snowy areas. Their results provide a balance between different targets that could be confused with clouds. By contrast, our study deals only with forest and agriculture areas; the images tested have no deserts, mountains or snow. By focusing on the Amazon biome, our results are intended as guidance for experts interested in measuring land change in the region. Given its focus, these results cannot be generalized to non-forest regions.A further consideration that could explain part of the differences between our work and that of Baetens et al. [26] is the choice of training data sets. While we use random sampling, those authors preferred to rely on active learning. An active learning model uses a few good quality samples instead of a large ensemble of random points. These good quality samples are used to train a machine learning model (random forest) whose output provides labels to a large set point for classification. In theory, this method has the advantage of being able to provide a larger number of points to test the algorithm. Machine learning models have a tendency to overfit their training data, which could cause wrong predictions [52]. The alternative is to use random samples, which rely on standard statistical assumptions. However, random samples can miss some cloud properties. Clouds come in different shapes, sizes, and transparencies; it is often hard to distinguish overlapping clouds at different heights from images. Random samples can also misrepresent minority labels such as cloud shadows. Therefore, both random sampling and active learning have their advantages and shortcomings for evaluating cloud detection algorithms. Further testing and comparison are required to evaluate these approaches.Another source of divergence between our result and that of Baetens et al. [26] is due to class relabeling. Cloud detection algorithms codify their results using different levels of detail. To enable comparisons, we had to recode them to the same set of labels. This process implies a loss of information, in particular for MAJA, which provides the most detailed data about its detection process. Thus, our recoding process could have had a negative impact on our evaluation of MAJA.Despite the differences discussed above, there are points of convergence between our work and earlier papers such as Baetens et al. [26] and Qiu et al. [25] related to Fmask 4 performance. The overall user’s and producer’s accuracy values for Fmask 4 are broadly consistent in the three studies. Qiu et al. [25] report producer’s accuracies for clouds, shadows and clear pixels to be 93%, 70%, and 97%, while our results are 96%, 75%, and 90%. Thus, we consider that Fmask 4 to be a reliable method that we recommend to be used for cloud detection in Sentinel-2 images of the Amazon rain forest.", 4. Discussion,None,4
705,"In this work, we compared four cloud detection algorithms on Sentinel–2A images of the Amazon tropical forest, and we found that Fmask 4 performs the best. We tested four cloud detection algorithms—FMask 4, Sen2Cor, MAJA, and S2cloudless—on 20 images with a different amount of cloud coverage, spread over five regions of Amazonia. We validated the results of the cloud detection algorithms using the criteria of experts on remote sensing who classified approximately 400 random points on each image. To determine the best algorithm, we computed the F1 score and the overall, user, and producer accuracies. We found that FMask 4 has an overall accuracy of 90% to detect clouds, while Sen2Cor’s OA is 79%, MAJA’s OA is 69%, and S2cloudless’s OA is 52%. Based on these results, we recommend the use of Fmask 4 for cloud detection of Sentinel-2 images of the Amazon region.The choice of method depends on the intended use. Therefore, users should consider the benefits of each method before making their choices. Since MAJA reduces the number of false positives by design, users that aim to improve the producer’s accuracy should consider its use. These characteristics could make MAJA suitable, for example, to build cloud-free monthly mosaics. Despite the poor performance of S2cloudless in our study, we consider that the use of machine learning methods for cloud detection is a promising way forward. As more good quality samples become available, its performance will improve. Finally, Sen2Cor is an efficient method to detect clouds in Sentinel-2 images. Despite not having the best performance, its ease of use may appeal to those that need fast processing of large data sets.We expect our work to impact on the building of data cubes of analysis-ready data from satellite imagery, like those currently under construction by the Brazil Data Cube project. (Brazil Data Cube project http://brazildatacube.org/) Another application is for improving the time series analysis of Land Use and Land Cover change of deforested areas, which is particularly hard because of cloud coverage. Given the performance of FMask 4, space agencies and committees such as CEOS should consider the value of working together to develop a standardized best quality cloud detection methods that could be shared and used for remote sensing optical imagery.The R and Python scripts used to compare the performance of cloud detection algorithms are available on GitHub: https://github.com/brazil-data-cube/compare-cloud-masks.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
706,"Monitoring the carbon cycle and carbon stocks is of high importance to understand climate change. Several studies have reported that more than 40% of the world’s vegetation carbon stocks is stored in tropical forests [1,2]. In tropical forests, the quantity of carbon represents 43% to 55% of Above Ground Biomass (AGB) [3,4,5]. Thus, mapping the AGB of tropical forests is of great importance in monitoring carbon stocks. Field inventories for AGB estimates, either by destructive (cutting and then weighing the tree) or non-destructive methods (by means of allometric equations), provide good estimates. However, these methods are not operational because they involve a great deal of labor and time and allow AGB estimates only at a local scale. Thus, a forest cannot be mapped using field inventories, hence the importance of remote sensing technology that facilitates the mapping of AGB. Indeed, remote sensing technology provides data for AGB estimates that cover large areas with a high spatial resolution and high revisit time.Three main remote sensing data types are used for AGB estimates: optical, SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar), and LiDAR. Optical images at low or medium resolutions and radar backscattering coefficient data are robust enough to estimate low to medium level AGB due to saturation of remote sensing data. Zhao et al. [6] and Lu et al. [7] have shown that optical data allow AGB estimates until AGB levels between 55 and 159 t/ha, depending on the forest species composition. In addition, SAR amplitude data, mainly in the L-band, were used to estimate the AGB. Luckman et al. [8] observed a saturation point of 60 t/ha when plotting the JERS L-band backscattering coefficients as a function of the forest biomass located in the Central Amazon Basin. Baghdadi et al. [9] found that the ALOS/PALSAR L-band backscattering coefficients saturate when the biomass of the Brazilian eucalyptus plantations reaches 50 t/ha. The use of radar backscattering coefficients in the P-band allows the estimation of higher AGB levels (290 t/ha for P-band [10]). However, to date, there are no available P-band SAR instruments operating from space, and the airborne P-band SAR data are commercial, which makes the use of these sensors expensive. The near future space-borne P-band SAR sensor (BIOMASS mission scheduled to launch in 2020) would allow tomographic analyses of SAR data for higher level AGB estimates [11]. Since Reigber and Moreira [12], the exploitation of SAR data for conducting tomographic analyses has been the object of a growing interest within the SAR community. By using tomography, forest biomass can be investigated by considering not only the backscatter at each slant range and azimuth location, but also its vertical distribution. The potential of tomography to characterize forest structure was previously assessed in a number of studies relating the vertical structure of forests to forest AGB over French Guiana [13,14,15]. In these studies conducted in French Guiana, the SAR signal in the P-band coming from upper vegetation layers (determined using SAR tomographic analyses) was found to be strongly correlated with forest AGB for AGB values ranging from 200 t/ha to 500 t/ha [13,15]. This finding was the first demonstration that forest AGB can be determined up to 500 t/ha with a 10% error at the 4-ha scale [14].Currently, LiDAR is the only available technology able to estimate higher AGB levels (up to 1200 t/ha from airborne LiDAR) [16,17] in comparison to optical and SAR amplitude data. LiDAR data capture the vertical structure of trees and allow the estimation of tree height up to 40 m with good precision [18,19,20]. The tree height derived from LiDAR is strongly correlated with the AGB of the trees, with no saturation at higher AGB values [19,21,22]. LiDAR data can be acquired from an aircraft and from space. Airborne and spaceborne LiDAR sensors record waveforms from small (<1 m) and large footprints (up to 60 m), respectively. Several studies have shown that the estimation of AGB from airborne LiDAR data is more accurate than that from spaceborne LiDAR [23,24]. However, the acquisition of airborne LiDAR data is costly, and the spatial coverage is limited to small areas. On the other hand, the available space-borne LiDAR data acquired by the Ice Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) are free, but do not provide continuous coverage of the earth. To overcome the limitation of spatial cover of LiDAR data and the saturation of optical and SAR amplitude data at medium AGB values, several studies tend to combined LiDAR with optical or SAR data for continuous AGB mapping at regional and global scales.At the regional scale, Mitchard et al. [21] estimated the AGB in Lopé National Park in central Gabon by coupling GLAS, PALSAR (L-band), and SRTM data. Lorey’s height was first derived from GLAS data and then converted to AGB through a simple equation. This equation was fitted using plot field measurements of Lorey’s height and AGB. Furthermore, a classification (40 classes) was performed using radar and SRTM data to determine regions with homogeneous vegetation. Finally, GLAS AGB estimates located within each region were averaged, enabling the spatial extrapolation of AGB estimates. The results showed relative error of AGB estimates of ±25% (AGB between 50 and 900 t/ha). Asner et al. [25] mapped the Aboveground Carbon Density “ACD” (ACD = 0.47 × AGB) in one northern (659,592 ha) and one southern (1,713,088 ha) region of Madagascar using airborne LiDAR data, SRTM derived variables, and optical images. First, ground-based ACD estimate plots located within all forest types were used to calibrate LiDAR data to the ACD. Later, the airborne LiDAR-derived ACD was related to the SRTM-derived variables and variables derived from optical data through a linear regression model. Finally, this linear model was applied to map the ACD at 1 ha resolution in the two regions. The results showed that the uncertainty of AGB estimates is equal to 35% and 10% in the northern and southern regions, respectively (ACD between approximately 5 t/ha and 300 t/ha in both regions).At the global scale, Saatchi et al. [22] mapped the AGB of world tropical forests using a combination of data from 4,079 in situ inventory plots (across the three tropical continents) and GLAS samples of forest structure, plus optical and microwave imagery with 1-km spatial resolution. In this study, a power-law functional relationship (R2 = 0.85) between the in situ Lorey’s height and in situ AGB was first performed. This relationship was then applied to tree height derived from GLAS to estimate AGB at each GLAS footprint location. Finally, a fusion model based on the maximum entropy (MaxEnt) approach was performed using spatial imagery to extrapolate AGB measurements from inventory plots and GLAS footprints to the entire landscape. Baccini et al. [26] derived a carbon density map of pan-tropical forests using GLAS data together with MODIS images (Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function and land surface temperature) and SRTM data. In this this study, in situ AGB was first derived from plots within GLAS footprints using trees characteristics. Then, a statistical relationship between the in situ AGB estimates and GLAS waveform metrics was established, allowing the estimation of AGB for all GLAS footprints located across the tropics. Finally, a model relating GLAS-based AGB estimates and MODIS and SRTM data was calibrated and applied to derive the AGB map. Mitchard et al. [27] assessed the reliability of a global AGB map produced by Saatchi et al. [22] and Baccini et al. [26] by using an accurate AGB map of Amazonian Columbia as a reference dataset. Mitchard et al. [27] observed substantial discrepancies between the maps of Saatchi et al. [22] and Baccini et al. [26] over tropical forest areas (up to ±150 t/ha), even though both maps give similar means and total AGB values on the continent scale. In addition, the maps of Saatchi et al. [22] and Baccini et al. [26] have higher AGB values (up to 150 t/ha) in comparison to the accurate AGB map of Amazonian Columbia. Such bias could be related to the saturation of spatial data and to the use of an insufficient number of high in situ AGB values during model calibration, which reduces model performance for the estimation of high AGB values.The main goal of this study is to investigate the contribution of spaceborne LiDAR data in overcoming the saturation at high AGB values of existing map produced in Madagascar by Vieilledent et al. [28] using optical satellite images, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and climatic variables. To produce its AGB map, Vieilledent et al. [28] first use a random forest model to relate in situ AGB measurements to the EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) derived from optical images, parameters calculated from the SRTM Digital Elevation Model, and climatic variables. Then, this random forest model was applied to map the AGB of forested areas in Madagascar. To date, the Vieilledent AGB map is the most recent and accurate map with medium resolution (250 m) for forested areas in Madagascar. The inconvenience of the Vieilledent AGB map is the inability to measure high AGB values, and therefore, a new method is required that incorporates LiDAR remote sensing to overcome such inconvenience. This inconvenience is mainly due to the use of the EVI and the percent tree cover derived from optical images at medium resolution as predictive variables for AGB estimates. The optical data at medium resolution saturates at high AGB values and induces an underestimation of high AGB [6,7]. An improvement in Vieilledent’s AGB map will allow a more accurate estimation of carbon stocks and mapping in forested areas in Madagascar. In our study, The AGB was first estimated from GLAS and DEM metrics, providing a spatially distributed (GLAS footprints geolocation) AGB estimation (GLAS AGB). Second, the spatial dependency of the additional correction factors (Vieilledent’s AGB map—GLAS AGB at each GLAS footprint location) was modeled, and an ordinary kriging interpolation of additional correction factors was performed to provide a correction factor map. Finally, the correction factor map and Vieilledent’s AGB map were summed to improve Vieilledent’s AGB map, taking into account the addition of GLAS data in AGB estimation. A description of the study area and the different datasets used in this study is provided in Section 2. Section 3 presents the methodology. The results and discussions are shown in Section 4 and Section 5, respectively. Finally, Section 6 presents the conclusion.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
707,"Madagascar is an island country in the Indian Ocean located to the southeast of the African continent (latitude between 12°S and 26°S, Figure 1). The total area of the country is approximately 58,154,000 ha, out of which 12,553,000 ha are forests, according to FAO estimates in 2010 (U.N. FAO). Between 1990 and 2010, Madagascar lost 8.3% of its forest cover (approximately 1,139,000 ha) [1]. Madagascar is composed of three ecoregions, with three forest types defined according to climate and vegetation type [29]. The eastern, western and southern parts contain mainly moist, dry and spiny forests, respectively [29] (Figure 1). The climates of the eastern, western and southern ecoregions are humid, temperate, and arid, respectively. This difference in climate is caused mainly by the Indian Ocean trade winds, which bring with them variations in precipitation throughout the region. The terrain in Madagascar is sloping. The slope of the eastern ecoregion reaches 25% and rises occasionally to reach 30%. The western and southern ecoregions are less sloping, with global slopes of less than 10%.", 2. Study Area and Datasets, 2.1. Study Area,2
708," 2.2.1. In Situ AGB DataNine forest inventories have been conducted to measure the AGB between 1995 and 2013 (1995, 1996, 2007, and 2009 through 2013) in 1771 field plots. The dimensions of the plots were 0.13 ha (radius = 30 m) in the moist forest, and 0.28 ha (radius = 20 m) in the dry and spiny forests. The AGB was computed for each tree (i) using the allometric equation defined by Chave et al. [30]:


AGBi = 0.0673 × (ρi Di Hi)°.976


(1)


where ρi is the tree wood density (g·cm−3), Di is the tree diameter (cm) at a height of 130 cm, and Hi is the tree height (m). Detailed descriptions about in situ AGB measurement procedures are given in the studies of Vieilledent et al. [28,31].The field inventories used in this study are those utilized by Vieilledent et al. [28], except those that were disturbed between 1995 and 2013, which were eliminated through an analysis of forest maps in 2000 derived by Harper et al. [32] and by the photo-interpretation of Landsat images time series between 2000 and 2013. The number of field inventories that were not disturbed between 1995 and 2013 is 1194 (Figure 1 and Figure 2).Field inventory methods for AGB estimates allow precise AGB estimates only at the local scale. Thus, mapping the AGB and calculating the total AGB for given wide forested areas could not be performed only by means of field inventories. Spaceborne LiDAR have the potential to map AGB, since these sensors provide precise spatially distributed information about tree height, which is well correlated to AGB. 2.2.2. Vieilledent’s Aboveground Biomass MapVieilledent’s AGB map [28] provides the AGB for forests in Madagascar in 2010, with a spatial resolution of 250 m. Vieilledent’s AGB map was derived from three types of explicative variables (vegetation indices, topography, and climatic data) using the Random Forest (RF) regression technique. Vegetation indices are the EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) and the percent tree cover (%VCF), both derived from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite remote sensing imagery acquired between 2000 and 2010. A topographic variable (elevation) was obtained from the 30-m resolution SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) global elevation dataset. Climatic data (1950–2000) are the cumulative annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, and temperature seasonality (standard deviation of monthly temperature × 100), all of which are extracted from the MadaClim website (http://madaclim.cirad.fr).To derive Vieilledent’s AGB map, in situ AGB were first related to explicative variables by means of the RF regression technique. Then, the resulting model was applied to map AGB in forested areas in Madagascar with spatial resolution of 250 m. Climatic variables were the most important, compared with EVI, %VCF, and elevation. In the study of Vieilledent et al. [28], a cross-validation procedure was used to validate the AGB map using field inventories as the reference dataset. 2.2.3. LiDAR DataLiDAR data were acquired between 2003 and 2009 by the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) sensor on board the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation (ICESat) Satellite. The GLAS sensor operates in the near-infrared (1064 nm) wavelength and illuminates footprints with a nearly circular shape that are approximately 70 m in diameter. GLAS LiDAR data are free and available for all continents. Footprints are separated by approximately 172 m in the along-track direction. The horizontal geolocation accuracy of the GLAS footprints is 3.7 m (on average), and the vertical accuracy is between 0 and 3.2 cm over flat surfaces, on average [33,34]. Only the GLA01 and GLA14 data products available from ICESAT/GLAS were used in this study. The GLA01 product contains the full recorded waveform data. The GLA14 product, derived from the GLA01 product, contains several useful data for each footprint, such as the cloud flag index, saturation waveform index, land surface elevation from SRTM, centroid elevation derived from the waveform, and background noise.To eliminate unreliable GLAS data (i.e., data affected by atmospheric conditions), several filters were applied: (1) footprints with associated centroid elevations significantly different than the corresponding SRTM elevations were excluded (|GLAS − SRTM| > 100 m); (2) footprints corresponding to waveforms with a low signal to noise ratio (SNR) were also removed (SNR < 15) [33]; (3) saturated waveforms were eliminated (saturation index satNdx # 0); and (4) only the cloud-free footprints were conserved (cloud flag FRir_qaFlag = 15). In addition, GLAS footprints located inside forest stands (selected using the existing AGB map) were conserved. From the original database of 1,772,000 footprints, 48,247 footprints that respect all criteria mentioned above were kept (Figure 1). The density of GLAS footprints in forested areas is 0.52 points/km2.Moreover, metrics were derived from reliable GLAS waveforms provided in the GLA01 product to represent the vertical variables of the canopy. These metrics are the Waveform extent (Wext), percentile heights (H) of GLAS waveforms (10 through 90%, with steps of 10%), Leading Edge (LE), and Trailing Edge (TE). A noise threshold equal to 4.5 times the standard deviation of the background noise was used to determine the waveform beginning and end [35]. The waveform extent is the difference between the signal end and signal start. The waveform extent was corrected for slope effects using the following equation [36,37]:


Wext_cor = Wext × 0.15 − 0.5 × d × tan (θ)


(2)


where d is the footprint diameter (in m), and θ is the mean slope of the illuminated surface area. Wext is expressed in ns and Wext_cor is in m.In addition, the Gaussian peaks resulting from the decomposition of each GLAS waveform, which represent canopy features, such as canopy top, canopy trunks, or ground, were identified. In this study, the first Gaussian peak was considered as the top of canopy return, and the stronger of the last two Gaussian peaks was selected as the ground return [38]. After identifying the top and ground peaks, the percentile heights of GLAS waveforms (10 through 90%, with steps of 10%) were also calculated from the signal beginning. Finally, the leading edge, defined as the elevation difference between the signal start and the canopy peak’s center, and the trailing edge, defined as the difference between the signal end and the ground peak’s center [18], were estimated. 2.2.4. Digital Elevation ModelThe SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 30 m was used is this study. Three variables were derived from the DEM: slope (θ), Terrain Index (TI), and surface Roughness (Roug). The TI map was obtained by calculating the difference between the highest and lowest altitude in a 3 × 3 pixel moving window. The surface Roug map was obtained by computing the standard deviation of the elevation in a 3 × 3 pixel moving window. All SRTM derived variables (θ, TI, and Roug) were resampled (averaging the value of the cells) to 250 m (Vieilledent’s AGB map resolution).", 2. Study Area and Datasets, 2.2. Datasets,2
709,"Nine forest inventories have been conducted to measure the AGB between 1995 and 2013 (1995, 1996, 2007, and 2009 through 2013) in 1771 field plots. The dimensions of the plots were 0.13 ha (radius = 30 m) in the moist forest, and 0.28 ha (radius = 20 m) in the dry and spiny forests. The AGB was computed for each tree (i) using the allometric equation defined by Chave et al. [30]:


AGBi = 0.0673 × (ρi Di Hi)°.976

where ρi is the tree wood density (g·cm−3), Di is the tree diameter (cm) at a height of 130 cm, and Hi is the tree height (m). Detailed descriptions about in situ AGB measurement procedures are given in the studies of Vieilledent et al. [28,31].The field inventories used in this study are those utilized by Vieilledent et al. [28], except those that were disturbed between 1995 and 2013, which were eliminated through an analysis of forest maps in 2000 derived by Harper et al. [32] and by the photo-interpretation of Landsat images time series between 2000 and 2013. The number of field inventories that were not disturbed between 1995 and 2013 is 1194 (Figure 1 and Figure 2).Field inventory methods for AGB estimates allow precise AGB estimates only at the local scale. Thus, mapping the AGB and calculating the total AGB for given wide forested areas could not be performed only by means of field inventories.

713,"Madagascar is composed of three climatic ecoregions with three different forest types (Figure 1). The western and southern ecoregions have lower in situ AGB values (<150 t/ha on average) compared to the eastern ecoregion (>250 t/ha on average). Accordingly, two different multilinear models were built to relate the in situ AGB to the GLAS metrics (Wext_cor, LE, TE, H10 through H90 with a 10% step) and DEM data (slope, TI, and Roug). The first model links the in situ AGB from the eastern ecoregion to the GLAS and DEM metrics. Similarly, the second model relates the in situ AGB from the western and southern ecoregions to the GLAS and DEM metrics. A step-wise regression technique (with both forward and backward processes) was used to select the best variables to be used for AGB estimation. Finally, these multilinear models were applied to all GLAS footprints, using only best variables to derive the AGB (GLAS AGB). GLAS footprints did not intersect in situ AGB.

714,"An ordinary kriging (OK) interpolation was used to improve the precision of Vieilledent’s AGB map. The OK model allows the interpolation of additional correction factors (Vieilledent’s AGB map—GLAS AGB at each GLAS footprint locations) based solely on a regionalized linear model known as a semivariogram.

Then, for each ecoregion, an OK interpolation was performed using the additional correction factors within that ecoregion to create a correction factor map. Furthermore, the correction factor map of that ecoregion was adding to the part of Vieilledent’s AGB map that overlaps to increase its precision. Finally, the two improved AGB maps (of both eastern and western ecoregions) derived using the two variograms were combined to obtain the improved AGB map that covered all of Madagascar with a spatial resolution of 250 m.To calculate the precision of the improved AGB map, first, a spatial intersection between the in situ AGB and the improved AGB map pixels was performed. Then, AGB pixels that contained at least two in situ AGB were selected, as well as the associated in situ AGB. Finally, the RMSE and R2 were calculated by using the averaged values of the in situ AGB located within the same AGB pixel.

715,"The precision of the improved AGB map was compared to that of the pan-tropical AGB map produced by Avitabile et al. [39] (Avitabile’s AGB map). Avitabile’s AGB map was used as benchmark because, to date, this map is considered to be the most recent and accurate pan-tropical AGB map. Avitabile et al. [39] combined the global AGB map of Saatchi et al. [22] and Baccini et al. [26] into a pan-tropical AGB map (1 km resolution) using reference AGB data. The fusion model consists of bias removal and weighted linear averaging of both the Saatchi et al. [22] and Baccini et al. [26] AGB maps to produce an AGB map with higher accuracy. The bias removal consisted of adding the mean difference between the input map and the reference AGB data to the input maps (Saatchi’s and Baccini’s AGB maps). The results showed that the RMSE of Avitabile’s AGB map (89 t/ha) is lower by 15%–21% than that of the input maps (Saatchi’s and Baccini’s AGB maps).Avitabile’s AGB map is produced with a spatial resolution of 0.00833° (1 km) and the WGS-84 geographic projection. To make Avitabile’s and the improved AGB map comparable, Avitabile’s AGB map was re-projected into UTM (Universal Transverse Mercator), to be in the same projection as the improved AGB map. In addition, the improved AGB map was resampled to 1 km as follows: the AGB pixels of the improved AGB map that fall within each cell of Avitabile’s AGB map were averaged.Finally, Avitabile’s AGB map and the improved AGB map resampled to a spatial resolution of 1 km were compared to the in situ AGB in the same manner adopted to validate the improved AGB map. However, to validate these maps, we used AGB pixels that cover more than three in situ AGB values.", 3. Methodology, 3.3. Comparison between the Improved AGB Map and Avitabile’s AGB Map,3
716,"To assess the relevance of our approach it was important to compare it to Baccini’s approach, since the latter is the most commonly used approach for AGB mapping [22,25,41]. First, we used our database (48,247 GLAS derived AGB, DEM metrics, and field inventories) and the auxiliary variables from the study of Vieilledent et al. [28], to produce a AGB map following the method proposed by Baccini et al. [26]. Then, we compared between precision of the improved AGB map and the precision of the AGB map from Baccini’s approach. The precision of the AGB map from Baccini’s approach was calculated in the same manner used to validate the improved AGB map.To produce the AGB map using Baccini’s approach, first, the established relationships between in situ AGB and both GLAS and DEM metrics (cf. Section 3.1) were applied to derive the AGB from each GLAS datapoint (48,247 footprints). Second, the GLAS-derived AGB values were related to the three types of explicative variables in the study of Vieilledent et al. [28] using the random forest model. Finally, the random forest model was applied for AGB mapping with a spatial resolution of 250 m, and the AGB map from Baccini’s approach was obtained.Baccini et al. [26] provided a pan-tropical AGB map covering Madagascar. In their study, the in situ AGB measurements used to build the relationship with GLAS and DEM metrics are missing over Madagascar. Therefore, Baccini’s AGB relationship is not representative enough to derive AGB estimates from GLAS metrics, leading to an AGB map with poor precision. For this reason, Baccini’s AGB map was reproduced in the present study using our in situ AGB measurements available for Madagascar.", 3. Methodology, 3.4. Comparison between the Improved AGB Map and the AGB Map from Baccini’s Approach,3
717,"14 plots neighboring GLAS footprints at a distance of 250 m in the eastern ecoregion were used to relate the in situ AGB to all GLAS and DEM metrics (Wext_cor, LE, TE, H10 through H90, slope, TI, and Roug). Similarly, 13 plots were used to link the in situ AGB to all GLAS and DEM metrics in the western and southern ecoregions. Considering a distance lower than 250 m to associate an in situ AGB value with GLAS footprints yields an insufficient sample number to build a model that predicts in situ AGB from both GLAS and DEM metrics. As an example, at a distance lower than 100 m, only 6 samples are available.For the eastern ecoregion, the results showed that the RMSE of AGB estimated using all GLAS and DEM metrics was equal to 56.2 t/ha (Relative Root Mean Square Error “RRMSE” ~20%, R2 = 0.90). For the western and southern ecoregions, the RMSE of AGB estimated from all GLAS and DEM metrics was equal to 20.7 t/ha (RRMSE~34%, R2 = 0.59). Moreover, the results show that for all ecoregions, the most significant variables for AGB estimates, determined using a stepwise regression, were Wext_cor, LE, H80 and TI:


AGBinsitu = Wext_cor + LE + H80 + TI


(5)

Table 1 shows the coefficients and p-values for each significant variable. The use of significant variables to derive the AGB decreases the error of in situ AGB estimates. For the eastern ecoregion, the RMSE decreased from 56.2 to 51.5 t/ha (RRMSE~18%, R2 = 0.91) when only the significant variables were used (Figure 4a). In addition, for the western and southern ecoregions, the use of significant variables decreased the RMSE of AGB estimates from 20.7 to 18.9 t/ha (RRMSE~31%, R2 = 0.66) (Figure 4b). Finally, these linear regression models were applied using only significant variables to derive the AGB from all GLAS footprints.", 4. Results, 4.1. Estimation of the AGB from GLAS,4
718,"To improve Vieilledent’s AGB map, the ordinary kriging technique was used. First, the difference (additional correction factors) between the AGB from Vieilledent’s AGB map and the GLAS AGB was calculated at the location of each GLAS footprint. Second, the semivariogram of the additional correction factors was performed for each ecoregion separately to respect the conditions of stationarity. Figure 5 shows the semivariogram samples (black points) obtained in the eastern ecoregion (Figure 5a) and in the western and southern ecoregions (Figure 5b). Semivariogram samples were then fitted using an exponential function with a nugget of 17,014 (t/ha)2, partial sill “difference between the nugget and the sill” of 10,710 (t/ha)2 and range of 16,699 m for the eastern ecoregion (Figure 5a), and with a nugget of 197 (t/ha)2, partial sill of 191 (t/ha)2 and range of 261 m for the western and southern ecoregions (Figure 5b). Furthermore, for each ecoregion, the additional correction factors were kriged using the exponential equation with the associated parameters (nugget, partial sill, and range) to provide a correction factor map for that ecoregion. Later, the correction factor map of that ecoregion was added to the corresponding part of Vieilledent’s AGB map to increase its precision. Finally, the two sub-improved AGB maps were combined to obtain the improved AGB map covering Madagascar. The improved AGB map has the same resolution as Vieilledent’s AGB map (250 m).The feasibility of the OK to improve Vieilledent’s AGB map was assessed by analyzing the evolution in the accuracy of Vieilledent’s AGB map after the integration of GLAS data. This evolution was determined by comparing the precision of Vieilledent’s AGB map to that of the improved AGB map (Vieilledent’s AGB map with the integration of GLAS data). As for the improved AGB map, the precision of Vieilledent’s AGB map was calculated using AGB pixels that cover at least two in situ AGB values. The precision of Vieilledent’s AGB map and the improved AGB map were calculated using 128 samples (each sample was obtained by averaging at least two in situ AGB values). These samples are located in all ecoregions and have values within the range of in situ AGB used to build the models relating in situ AGB to both GLAS and DEM metrics (Figure 6). Figure 6a shows the AGB from Vieilledent’s AGB map as a function of the average in situ AGB. Similarly, the comparison between the AGB from the improved AGB map and the average in situ AGB is shown in Figure 6b. The results show that the OK decreased the RMSE of Vieilledent’s AGB map by 6.9 t/ha; the RMSE of the improved AGB map is 74.1 t/ha (R2 = 0.71, RRMSE = 28.2%) compared to an RMSE of 81.0 t/ha (R2 = 0.62, RRMSE = 30.8%) for AGB estimates from Vieilledent’s AGB map.In addition, statistics were calculated separately for in situ AGB lower and higher than 400 t/ha. For in situ AGB lower than 400 t/ha, the precision of the improved AGB map was better than the precision of Vieilledent’s AGB map; the RMSE of the improved AGB map was 61.7 t/ha (R2 = 0.52) and the RMSE of Vieilledent’s AGB map was 69.3 t/ha (R2 = 0.49). Similarly, for AGB higher than 400 t/ha, the precision of the improved AGB map (RMSE = 125.6, R2 = 0.34) was better than the precision of Vieilledent’s AGB map (RMSE = 131.4 t/ha, R2 = 0.17). Thus, the precision of Vieilledent’s AGB map was improved for both lower and higher values of AGB.", 4. Results, 4.2. The Improved AGB Map,4
719,"A comparison between Vieilledent’s AGB map and the improved AGB map was also performed. At the scale of Madagascar, the results showed that the mean AGB values from both maps are similar (204.8 t/ha for Vieilledent’s AGB map, and 197.0 t/ha for the improved AGB map). However, important differences between these maps were observed when the two maps were compared visually (Figure 7). In particular, in the north of the eastern ecoregion, the improved AGB map was able to provides much higher AGB values (up to 647.7 t/ha) compared to Vieilledent’s AGB map (maximum AGB pixel value of 529.5 t/ha). In addition, the absolute difference between both maps (the improved AGB map—Vieilledent’s AGB map) was more important in the eastern ecoregion than in the western and southern ecoregions (Figure 7c). In the eastern ecoregion, this difference (the improved AGB map—Vieilledent’s AGB map) frequently reaches values lower than −100 t/ha and higher than 100 t/ha. For both the western and southern ecoregions, intermediate difference values were obtained (between –40 and 100 t/ha). In addition, the relative difference between the improved AGB map and Vieilledent’s AGB map was performed. For the eastern ecoregion, the results showed that the AGB estimates from Vieilledent’s AGB map were generally decreased and increased by 25% and 50% at the most, respectively. The increase (up to 50%) was observed mainly for a dense forest stand located in the north of the eastern ecoregion, whereas the decrease (up to 25%) was observed throughout the eastern ecoregion. For both the western and southern ecoregions, the decreases and the increases of the AGB estimates from Vieilledent’s AGB map were up to 50% and 100%, respectively.Finally, the carbon stock was computed from both Vieilledent’s AGB map and the improved AGB map. To compute the carbon stock, the sum of AGB pixel values was first multiplied by 0.47 to convert AGB to carbon stock, and then multiplied by 6.25 to convert from hectares to an area of 250 m × 250 m (the improved AGB map pixel resolution). The carbon stock in Madagascar from the improved AGB map was estimated to be 0.85964 × 1015 PgC (1 PgC = 1015 grams carbon) compared to 0.89350 × 1015 from Vieilledent’s AGB map.", 4. Results,  4.3.

The results showed that Avitabile’s AGB map is much less accurate (RMSE = 168.9 t/ha, RRMSE = 53.9%, R2 = 0.04) than the improved AGB map with a 1 km spatial resolution (RMSE = 68.9 t/ha, RRMSE = 22.0%, R2 = 0.80).Finally, the carbon stock was calculated from Avitabile’s AGB map and the improved AGB map with a spatial resolution of 1 km. The carbon stock from Avitabile AGB was 1.08548 PgC, which is considerably higher than the carbon stock value calculated from the improved AGB map with spatial resolution of 1 km (0.85628 PgC).", 4.

721,"In this section, the precision of the improved AGB map and the precision of the AGB map from Baccini’s approach were compared. The results show that the AGB map from Baccini’s approach has quite low precision, with a RMSE of 135 t/ha (RRMSE = 51.5%), in comparison to the precision of the improved AGB map, with a RMSE of 74.1 t/ha (RRMSE = 28.2%) (Figure 9). For the AGB map from Baccini’s approach, the RMSE is equal to 118.1 t/ha and 212.2 t/ha for in situ AGB lower and higher than 400 t/ha, respectively. In addition, the AGB map from Baccini’s approach was not able to map AGB higher than 500 t/ha (value obtained from the AGB map using Baccini’s approach).", 4. Results, 4.5. Comparison between the Improved AGB Map and the Baccini’s Approach AGB Map,4
722,"In this study, a method based on the use of GLAS data was developed mainly to overcome the saturation at high AGB values of the existing AGB map derived by Vieilledent et al. [28] using optical images, parameters computed from DEM, climatic variables, and field inventories. A good correlation between in situ AGB and GLAS and DEM metrics was obtained (R2 = 0.91 for the eastern ecoregion, and R2 = 0.66 for the western and southern ecoregions). Despite the fact that the relationships between in situ AGB and both GLAS and DEM metrics was built with only a few in situ AGB samples (14 for the eastern ecoregion, and 13 for the western and southern ecoregions) located within a distance of 250 m from GLAS footprints, the integration of GLAS data leads to an improvement in the precision of Vieilledent’s AGB map (Figure 6). This improvement was possible because Vieilledent’s AGB map was created by using the EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index) computed from optical images as an input parameter. The EVI saturates at higher AGB levels, leading to an underestimation of high AGB values, which limits the estimation of AGB to lower values (lower than 550 t/ha in the study of Vieilledent et al. [28]). In contrast, our approach is based on the integration of LiDAR GLAS data, which are able to provide much higher AGB values, and thus improve Vieilledent’s AGB map (derived using optical data), even in densely forested areas (in situ AGB up to 650 t/ha). However, results showed that the improved AGB map values still underestimate the in situ AGB values for AGB higher than 350 t/ha. This is probably due to the fact that (1) the used spaceborne LiDAR data are not sufficiently dense (0.5 points/km2) to completely eliminate the high underestimation of AGB for values higher than 350 t/ha and (2) the data used, mainly optical (such as EVI), to derive the Vieillendent’s AGB map have low sensitivity to high AGB values (high than 350 t/ha). Fayad et al. [42] showed that the use of dense spaceborne and airborne LiDAR data in addition to other data (optical, DEM, and environmental) provides good estimation of the AGB. In general, the integration of GLAS-derived AGB moderately increases the precision of Vieilledent’s AGB map by 7.6 t/ha and 5.8 t/ha for AGB values lower and higher than 400 t/ha, respectively. Considering in our method remote sensing variables that describe the floristic composition and the biogeography characteristics of forested areas would improve the precision of GLAS-derived AGB and consequently, the correction factor map, and thus brought a larger improvement to Vieilledent’s AGB map. Finally, our approach could be applied to improve the most recent and accurate pan-tropical AGB map produced by Avitabile et al. [39] because GLAS LiDAR shots cover the pan-tropical forested areas [43]. Applying our approach would improve Avitabile’s AGB map mainly by overcoming the problem of saturation at high AGB values.Our approach uses an existing AGB map (Vieilledent’s AGB map). The use of an existing AGB map does not represent an inconvenience, since it would have been possible for us to derive this AGB map from freely available remote sensing data. The advantage of the proposed approach is that despite LiDAR data density of 0.5 points/km2, a simple ordinary kriging seems sufficient to improve an AGB map derived using optical data (such as Vieilledent’s AGB map). It should be noted that GLAS footprints have a good distribution over forested areas in Madagascar. The main potential limitation of our approach is the unavailability of GLAS data since 2009 (GLAS data are between 2003 and 2009). Thus, this method could be applied to improve an AGB map created using data from between 2003 and 2009 and to an AGB map for forests with conditions that have not changed with respect to the period between 2003 and 2009. In addition, field inventories are necessary to apply our approach. However, a relatively low number of field inventories could be enough to calibrate LiDAR and SRTM metrics data to AGB [25].In this paper, we also compared the improved AGB map and the most recent pan-tropical AGB map provided by Avitabile et al. [39]. Avitabile’s AGB map was created using a fusion of data from Baccini’s and Saatchi’s AGB maps and reference data. The results showed that the improved AGB map has better precision than Avitabile’s AGB map. This is because the reference data used for the calibration of the fusion model in the study of Avitabile et al. [39] does not cover the ranges of AGB values of forested areas in Madagascar (up to 700 t/ha according to our in situ AGB measurements). These reference data used by Avitabile et al. [39] (60 samples) are located in a zone to the north of Madagascar characterized by in situ AGB values lower than 235 t/ha [39].In addition, the most popular method, proposed by Baccini et al. [26], for AGB mapping was applied using our in situ AGB measurements to produce an AGB map (Baccini’s approach AGB map). The results showed that the accuracy of the Baccini’s approach AGB map was lower than the accuracy of the improved AGB map. Thus, it seems that using optical data as predictive variables to derive AGB estimates do not allow to the accurate estimation of high AGB values, even if GLAS-derived AGB values are used to establish the relationship with the optical data.Finally, our approach could be applied to improve the existing global pan-tropical AGB map, mainly by overcoming the problem of saturation at high AGB values, from which most of these recent pan-tropical maps, such as Avitabile’s AGB map and Baccini’s AGB map, suffer.", 5. Discussion,None,5
723,"This study analyzed the potential of LiDAR sensor data and ICESat/GLAS data to improve a AGB map recently established in Madagascar (Vieilledent’s AGB map) using optical and digital elevation model spatial imagery and climatic variables. First, GLAS data were used to provide AGB estimates at 48,247 footprint locations covering the forested areas in Madagascar between 2003 and 2009 with a density of 0.5 points/km2 of forest (Figure 1). Second, the additional correction factors, which are the difference between Vieilledent’s AGB map and GLAS AGB, were calculated. Third, an ordinary kriging interpolation was performed using these additional correction factors to provide a correction factor map. Finally, Vieilledent’s AGB map and the correction factor map were summed to improve Vieilledent’s AGB map.The results showed that the precision of the improved AGB map (RMSE = 74.1 t/ha, R2 = 0.71, N = 128) produced is better than that of the Vieilledent’s AGB map (RMSE = 81.0 t/ha, R2 = 0.62, N = 128). In addition, results showed that the improved AGB map allows higher estimates of AGB than Vieilledent’s AGB map. Indeed, the AGB values in the improved AGB map reach 650 t/ha, whereas the maximum AGB value in Vieilledent’s AGB map is 550 t/ha. For the improved AGB map, the number of AGB pixels (size = 250 m × 250 m) with a value higher than 550 t/ha is 13,241, covering an area of approximately 68,917 ha in the eastern ecoregion, out of which 61,865 ha represent one continuous forest stand located to the north of the eastern ecoregion.Moreover, the results show that our approach provides more precise AGB estimates in comparison to the approaches proposed by Baccini et al. [26] and Avitabile et al. [39]. This is because the in situ AGB measurements used to calibrate the GLAS data, i.e., derive AGB from GLAS metrics, cover the range of all in situ AGB values. In addition, optical data that saturate at higher AGB values were not used in the procedure, which leads to the improvement in Vieilledent’s AGB map.A limitation of our method is the unavailability of new GLAS data because ICESat ceased operations in 2009. However, this method could be applied to improve existing AGB maps constructed for forests before 2010 because data acquired by ICESat between 2003 and 2009 are free. The Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation LiDAR (GEDI) mission (launch date in 2019) will ensure LiDAR data with a smaller footprint (25 m) for better mapping of pan-tropical forests.Finally, we assume that the nominal year of the improved AGB map is 2010 because we used the Vieilledent’s AGB map performed for the year of 2010, in addition to spaceborne LiDAR data acquired between 2003 and 2009.", 6.

724,"As an indispensable component of the world’s forest resources, planted forests make up approximately 6.94% of global forest areas [1]. Planted forests make significant contributions to society and the environment and have the potential to provide not only timber products (e.g., wood, fiber and fuel), but also non-timber forest services and ecological functions [2,3], such as carbon sequestration, rehabilitation of degraded land, and species diversity conservation [3,4]. China currently has the largest planted forest area at 91.8 million ha, approximately 33.03% of total planted forests in the world [1,5]. Subtropical planted forests account for approximately 9% of planted forest areas in the world [5] and are regarded as an important ecosystem with higher species richness and higher productivity, compared to boreal or temperate forests [6]. Differing from natural or semi-natural forests, subtropical planted forests usually endure intensive harvest or other human disturbance, due to commercial operations. China, especially in the southeastern region, also contains the largest proportion of low latitude humid subtropical forests, which play an essential role in establishing an ecological balance and improving environmental quality [7,8]. Attributes describing forest structure can be an imperative support tool in forest management planning [9]. Thus, timely, effectively, and accurately acquiring up-to-date and reliable information on the state and structure attributes of China’s subtropical planted forests is crucial for enhancing forest productivity, understanding forest ecological function, supporting forest management decisions, improving silvicultural treatments (e.g., thinning, timber harvesting and assortment) and promoting sustainable management [1,10,11,12].Tree diameter distributions of forest stands are critical to describing forest structures and functions [13,14,15,16]. For example, a diameter distribution is an essential component for calculation of stand volume, biomass, and carbon stocks [14,17,18], stand-level timber assortment [17,19], assessment of ecological biodiversity [20,21], and forest growth and yield [22]. Accurately predicting diameter distributions of planted forest stands is of great importance to inform forest managers for understanding forest structure and succession [23], updating forest inventories [24] and scheduling optimal silvicultural treatments [25], thereby facilitating efficient use of forest resources and supporting sustainable management [26]. Traditionally, forest inventories for acquiring diameter distribution have relied on field measurements, which is time consuming, spatially constrained, and labor intensive [27]. As a result, remote sensing has become a key instrument to enhance traditional forest inventories and inform spatial forest management planning [27,28,29]. Airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) has been widely regarded as an information-rich tool for accurately characterizing 3D forest structure and providing spatially consistent wall-to-wall estimations of forest attributes, such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height, basal area, volume, stem density and biomass in an area-based approach (ABA) [30,31,32].In recent years, due to strong correlation with LiDAR-derived forest structure attributes (e.g., DBH, basal area, volume, stem density, etc.) [33], airborne LiDAR has shown potential in predicting diameter distributions using a variety of strategies [24,27,28,34,35,36,37,38,39]. One such strategy, using parametric distributions, is based on the assumption that the diameter distribution’s probability density can be characterized by a theoretical probability density function (PDF) [22,35], e.g., Weibull, beta, gamma and Log-normal [27]. The Weibull model has been widely applied for modeling diameter distributions, due to its flexibility and fewer parameters [40]. The ABA method for estimating diameter distributions by airborne LiDAR employs LiDAR metrics as predictors to estimate density function parameters [22], such as the scale and shape parameters, in the case of a Weibull model. Gobakken and Næsset [39] were among the first to predict diameter distributions based on estimated Weibull parameters using airborne LiDAR data over a boreal forest in southeast Norway. In studies, such as this, diameter distributions derived from a unimodal Weibull (UWM) model could accurately be predicted by LiDAR data. Another parametric approach used to infer diameter distributions is a parameter recovery method (PRM), which is an indirect approach that first estimates other distribution-related attributes and then uses these estimates to predict parameters of one PDF, e.g., a Weibull model. The PRM approach can be parameterized by the field-inventoried forest attributes [41,42,43,44], e.g., stand age, DBH, height, and volume, or by LiDAR metrics [45]. However, for irregular stand structures, such as uneven-aged stands, mixed-species stands, and old-growth stands, the use of these UWM and PRM may lead to an oversimplified characterization of diameter distributions and the irregularities of distributions are more or less ignored [38,46]. For these structural types, an alternative method for modeling a multimodal or irregular distribution of diameters is a finite mixture model (FMM), which is made up of two or more component distributions (typically Weibull) [47,48]. Thomas et al. [36] compared an FMM approach using two component Weibull distributions and a UWM to predict diameter distributions with LiDAR data in the boreal forest stands of central Ontario. Results suggested that the FMM approach provided more effective predictions of diameter distribution than the UWM in irregular stands. Mulverhill et al. [48] used the FMM approach to predict diameter distributions in bimodal stands that were differentiated by LiDAR metrics in a boreal mixedwood forest. They found that the FMMs provided more accurate estimates for bimodal stands compared with unimodal Weibull models.A non-parametric strategy with an effective ability to predict multimodal diameter distributions is a k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) imputation model [22,33,35]. KNN is a reliable strategy in more irregular forest stand structures, because KNN does not rely on any underlying probability distribution [49,50,51] and can accurately describe the local variability of diameter distributions [37,52]. The most frequently employed imputation method is a Most Similar Neighbor (MSN), in which the k neighbor reference observations are determined by distances computed in a projected canonical space [53]. Packalén and Maltamo [27] employed the MSN method to impute diameter distributions and compared the performance of MSN to a Weibull model in Finnish boreal forests. They found that the diameter distribution based on MSN imputed tree-lists outperformed the Weibull distribution. Maltamo et al. [38] also applied airborne LiDAR data to predict stand diameter distributions in south-eastern Norway. Their results reported the utility of non-parametric MSN method for prediction of diameter distributions. Recently, Random Forest (RF) [54] has been adapted as a KNN imputation method [55] in which numerous classification trees fitted from a random sample of reference data are concatenated to calculate the proportion of shared terminal nodes across all the response variables for the purpose of “identifying nearest neighbors” [56], and therefore represent an essentially different approach from the other KNN imputation methods [57]. Penner et al. [58] found the potential of this imputation method to predict tree diameter distributions in a northeastern Ontario boreal forest. Strunk et al. [35] also evaluated RF imputation strategies for prediction of tree diameter distributions with tree species using LiDAR data in a boreal forest. The utility of RF imputation also been reported by Shang et al. [59].Using LiDAR data for predicting diameter distributions are usually based on UWM approaches that are difficult to implement for complex forest stands, whereas studies related to using multimodal FMM or KNN approach to predict multimodal diameter distributions are few. Furthermore, previous studies for estimating LiDAR-derived diameter distributions are typically limited to boreal forests of Europe [33,37,38,39,51,60,61] or boreal and temperate forests of North America [36,48,58], whereas few studies focus on subtropical planted forests. Predicting diameter distributions of subtropical planted forests aid in operational planning of timber harvest and other silvicultural treatments. In this study, we predicted diameter distributions using multimodal FMM and KNN approaches compared to UWM based on airborne LiDAR data in a subtropical planted forest of Southern China. The aims of this study are: (1) To evaluate the capability of LiDAR for discriminating unimodal and multimodal stands by examining the modality of diameter distributions; (2) to implement multimodal FMM and KNN models for predicting tree diameter distributions, and to investigate the sensitivity of various KNN strategies, including the number of neighbors (i.e., k), response configurations and imputations approaches (i.e., MSN and RF) for KNN-imputed diameter distributions; and (3) to assess the performance of FMM and KNN models for predicting diameter distributions by comparing to those estimated by UWM.", 1.

725,"This study was conducted in Gaofeng Forest, a state-operated planted forest located near the town of Nanning city of Guangxi Province in southern China, approximately between latitudes 22°49′ N, 23°5′ N and longitudes 108°7′ E, 108°38′ E (Figure 1). The area of the study site is approximately 5200 ha with the elevation range between approximately 80 m and 460 m above sea level. The climate of this study site belongs to a typical south-subtropical monsoon with annual mean temperature, mean precipitation means a relative humidity and annual total sunshine of approximately, of 21.6 °C, 1304.2 mm, 79%, 1500–1700 h. The highest monthly precipitation occurs in summer. The main soil type is lateritic red soil developed by sand shale, and the average thickness of the soil layer is above 80 cm. The Gaofeng Forest is a south-subtropical plantation type with two main habitats: Conifer-dominated and broadleaf-dominated. Planted broadleaf tree species are mainly swamp mahogany (Eucalyptus robusta Smith), along with Timor white gum (Eucalyptus urophylla ST Blake) and flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis L.). The dominant coniferous tree species is Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.). Other species include Acacia confuse Merr., Magnolia glance Blume. and Pinus massoniana Lamb.", 2.

726,"The field surveys for ground data acquisition of the study site was carried out from 16 January to 3 February 2018. 49 fixed-area square sample plots (20 × 20 m) within the study site were used in this research. All plots were divided into those dominated by Chinese fir (n = 20) and those dominated by Eucalypt (n = 29). The center position of each plot and each plot corner were registered using a Trimble juno T41/5 Handheld GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) instrument (including a GPS Collector) (Trimble, Sunnyvale, CA, USA), and corrected with high-precision real-time corrected differential post-processing signals received from Trimble NetR9 GNSS Reference Receiver equipped with Trimble Zephyr Geodetic Model 2 GNSS Antenna, resulting in a positional of accuracy of less than 0.5 m [62]. The plot directions were recorded by forest compass, and the border lengths were measured by PI tape. For all live trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) over 5 cm, species, DBH, height, height to crown base, crown width in both cardinal directions were measured. In addition, small trees (DBH < 5 cm) and dead wood were also tallied for total stem density, but not used in volume calculations.Table 1 shows a summary of plot-level DBH, mean height (H), stem density (N), basal area (G) and volume (V). The individual tree volume with each plot was calculated according to the local provincial species volume equations, which were based on DBH and tree height as predictive variables. Then, plot-level volume was summed by the calculated tree volume within each plot.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Field Data,2
727,"A workflow for predicting diameter distributions by airborne LiDAR data is shown in Figure 2. The workflow includes three main steps: Data pre-processing, modality differentiation and modeling diameter distributions. In step one, a 1 m Digital Terrain Model (DTM) was generated by calculating the average elevation of LiDAR ground returns within a rasterized cell grid. Metrics were then extracted from point clouds normalized by the DTM. In step two, field plots were classified as either unimodal or multimodal using a bimodality coefficient (BC). Then, the capability of BC, along with the Gini coefficient (GC) and Lorenz asymmetry (LA) predicted by LiDAR metrics were assessed to differentiate modality. In step three, the UWM and FMM were generated for diameter distributions of estimated unimodal and multimodal plots. For comparison, a KNN model was also employed for constructing diameter distributions using LiDAR-derived metrics. KNN diameter distribution prediction strategies, including number of neighbors (i.e., k), response configurations and imputation methods (i.e., MSN and RF) were also examined. Finally, the performance of LiDAR predicted diameter distributions was evaluated. These steps are described in further detail below.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Data Acquisition and Pre-Processing,2
728,"The small footprint airborne LiDAR data were acquired over the entire study site, initially from 17 to 30 January 2018. The LiDAR data acquisition was operated from a fixed-wing aircraft flown at 750 m above ground level with a flight speed of 180 km/h, using a Riegl LMS-Q680i sensor (Riegl Laser Measurement Systems, GmbH, Horn, Austria) integrated into the LiCHy System [63]. The flight line side-lap was 65% and the sensor recorded a temporal sample spacing of a laser pulse was 1 ns (approximately 15 cm). The emitted laser pulses by LiDAR system were in the near-infrared band (1550 nm) with a 300 kHz pulse repetition frequency and an 80 Hz scanning frequency. The maximum scanning angle and FOV (field of view) were ±30° from nadir, 60°, respectively. The average ground point distances of the dataset in flying and scanning direction were both of 0.45 m in a single strip, with a point density of approximately 8.51 pulses/m2. The average points density on sample plots was 9.58 pulses/m2 and the average beam footprint size was 0.45 m (nadir) in diameter. Extracted point clouds and associated waveforms were stored in LAS (log ASCII standard) 1.2 format (American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Bethesda, MD, USA).To obtain tree heights from normalized point clouds, raw point cloud data were first de-noised under the processing of removing outliers. The above-ground return points were filtered using an Improved Progressive TIN Densification (IPTD) filter algorithm adapted from Zhao et al. [64]. After filtering the above-ground points, a 1-m Digital terrain model (DTM) was generated by calculating the average elevation from the ground points within a rasterized cell grid. If there were no returns within cell grids, these cell grids were filled by interpolation using an Inverse Distance Weighted (IDW) algorithm). Then, the point cloud was normalized against the DTM surface height. Point clouds for all plots (n = 49) were extracted using the coordinates of the lower left and upper right corners.LiDAR metrics were generated from normalized point clouds and were classified into two groups: Standard metrics [65] and canopy metrics [66] (see details in Table A1). Standard metrics mainly involved height-related metrics (e.g., height percentile, mean height, skewness and kurtosis of heights) and canopy return density-related metrics (e.g., density and canopy cover). Canopy metrics included a set of canopy volume (CV) metrics which represent spatial organization of the tree material (e.g., trunk, foliage, etc.) and the total canopy volume within the canopy [67], along with others, such as rumple, coefficient of variation of leaf area density (CvLAD) [68] and vertical complexity index (VCI) [69]. The canopy volume metrics of this study were calculated by a voxel-based canopy volume model (CVM) with a 5 × 5 × 1 m3 voxel resolution. The metrics used as predictor variables were calculated for the 20 × 20 m plots using procedures similar to that of Naesset [70] by FUSION [71] and Matlab Software [72].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. LiDAR Data and Metrics,2
729,"Although having relative simple structures compared to other natural forests, subtropical planted forests still show a certain degree of heterogeneity of structural types. To estimate tree diameter distributions of forest stands more accurately than only using a UWM in this heterogeneous forests, prior discrimination of forest structural types (FSTs) and knowledge of appropriate models to pertinently fit diameter distributions is required [48,73,74]. In this study, we attempted to stratify forest stands into two generalized FSTs, i.e., unimodal and multimodal, by examining the modality of diameter distributions for each plot using LiDAR-derived predictions. Referring to Mulverhill et al. [48], we identified modality of sample data distribution each plot using a bimodality coefficient (BC), which reflects a form of the distribution of sample data, to The BC is the sum of the squared skewness of a distribution (g) and 1, divided by the sum of the kurtosis (kt) and a correction factor (C), and has the following equation [75]:

where n the number of samples. C varies between 3 and 4, depending on the number of observations n, and corrects for the fact that the kurtosis of a normal distribution equals 3. The value of BC for the uniform distribution is 5/9. In this case, values of BC for ground-measured diameter distributions greater than 5/9 will indicate bimodal or multimodal diameter distributions. Thus, total 49 plots were classified into 23 unimodal plots and 26 multimodal plots (Table 2).Previous studies [26,74,76,77,78] pointed out superiority of Lorenz curves for describing FSTs and suggested their derived indicators as a good alternative for describing tree size inequality. In a forest stand, the Lorenz curve represents dominance relations by comparing relative cumulative proportions of basal area and stem density accounted for each tree [78]. The descriptors of Lorenz curves, the Gini coefficient (GC) and Lorenz asymmetry (LA), were regarded as relevant indicators of forest structure. These two Lorenz-based indicators have been used as a basis for characterizing tree size inequality to stratify the forest area into homogeneous or heterogeneous stands [77]. The value of GC is equal to half of the relative mean difference in size among all the trees, and it is usually conceptualized as the area comprised between the Lorenz curve and the diagonal line-of absolute-equality [78]. LA describes the skewness of Lorenz curves. Valbuena et al. [74] reported that the values of GC greater than 0.5 and LA less than 0.5 suggest multimodal diameter distributions. Based on this decision rule, GC and LA were as a suite of Lorenz-based indicators for identifying unimodal or multimodal plots in this study. The GC and LA were derived from Lorenz curves generated by ‘ineq’ in R software [79,80].In an operational context, LiDAR predictions have the capability to extrapolate this modality differentiation from a grid cell to larger spatial extents. Thus, the BC, GC and LA can be predicted by LiDAR metrics and used as estimates of modality differentiation. Finally, LiDAR predictions for modality differentiation were assessed by determining the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the classification. The differentiation accuracy was defined as the percentage of all plots that were correctly classified as either unimodal or multimodal plots. The initial classification in Table 2 was used as a reference.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Modality Differentiation,2
730,"As a two-parameter Weibull distribution is greatly adaptive, ranging from an inversed J-shape to unimodal skewed and unimodal symmetrical curve, the Weibull distribution has been shown to be able to characterize a wide range of tree size distributions (e.g., diameter or basal area distribution) in forest stands [40,81]. The two-parameter Weibull distribution is generated by integrating the Weibull density function, and has the following equation:

Estimation of Weibull parameters is typically performed by maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), because of its consistently better goodness-of-fit statistics when compared to the previous methods [25,82]. Thus, the MLE method was used for the calculation of the Weibull parameters.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.6. Unimodal Weibull Model,2
731,"A finite mixture model (FMM) is used to describe the multimodal distributions of tree diameter in mixed species or uneven-aged forest stands [46,83].

The Selection of Number of Neighbors, Response Configurations and Imputation MethodsKNN, a non-parametric approach, assigns the mean of observed response values of the k nearest reference units to the target unit [86]. In this study, diameter distributions could be compiled from tree-level data from the nearest plots [37]. Two nearest neighbor (NN) imputation strategies were tested in this study: Most Similar Neighbor (MSN) and Random Forest (RF). For MSN, a canonical correlation analysis was used to produce a distance metric that determines which k nearest neighbors are most similar to the target observation according to the predictor variables [37,53].In RF, observations are considered similar if they tend to converge in the same terminal node in a suitably constructed collection of classification and regression trees [54]. The metric used to define statistical distance is calculated as one minus the proportion of trees where a target observation is in the same terminal node as a reference observation [55,87]. Here, the RF imputation was set to generate 500 regression trees (‘ntree’) in each run, and the number of predictor variables was fixed at the square root of the number of LiDAR metrics (i.e., ‘mtry’ = 


n


) [58]. In this study, the imputed value was produced as a weighted average over the k neighbors, or as a mode, where the count was the sum of the weights rather than each having a weight of 1, as in the case of a categorical variable [56].

The response variables of imputations used in this study were volume (V), basal area (G), mean height (H), mean diameter at breast height (DBH), and stem density (N), because they have a strong correlation with diameter distributions and can be successfully predicted with LiDAR in previous studies [27,33,37,38]. Combinations of these five responses made up the 15 response sets listed in Table 3. The effect of the number of neighbors k was investigated at a range of 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 with the SET1 (V, G, H, DBH, N) response configuration. Once the optimal value of k was determined, a sensitivity analysis of response configurations and imputation methods (i.e., MSN and RF) was carried out. Since RF imputation allows the number of variables to be much larger than the number of training samples [57,88], all LiDAR-derived metrics were used as predictor variables for RF imputation. In order to ensure comparability between the two imputation methods, MSN also employed all metrics. Two imputations were generated by the ‘yaImpute’ package in R [55,79]. In the RF imputation, scaled importance values of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) metrics were calculated by the ‘yaiVarImp’ function in the ‘yaImpute’ package [55]. 2.8.2. Constructing Diameter Distribution Based on KNNAs nearest neighbors were found by means of KNN imputation, the diameter distributions of reference neighbors can be used to construct a tree list of a target plot. To impute diameter distributions of target plot i, the stem density (N) of reference plot j and weight Wij for the distance between plot i and j were required. In this study, the field measured stem density and KNN imputed N were respectively used for predicting diameter distributions.

735,"In this study, we used Pearson’s correlation (r) between total LiDAR metrics and parameters of predictive models for selecting optimal metrics. The metrics were chosen as candidate metrics to enter into regression analyses when r is greater than 0.6 [89]. To improve model linearity all of the dependent variables (i.e., BC, GC, LA and parameters of UWM and FMM) and independent variables (i.e., LiDAR-derived metrics) were converted into a form of natural logarithm in the regression analyses, due to the fact that this functional form could provide more accurate estimates of forest structure attributes [70]. In addition, this form model with a positive intercept will lead to non-zero estimates of structural attributes compared with some linear models with negative intercepts when developed models are extrapolated to larger scales. Then all variables were back-transformed from natural logarithm to original arithmetic units using a bias correction factor (BCF) [90].Regression models were constructed as non-specific models (i.e., all plots), species-specific models (i.e., Chinese fir plots and Eucalypt plots), and structure-specific models (i.e., classified unimodal plots and multimodal plots). Independent variables were left in the model using an F-test with a p < 0.05 significance level [91]. To avoid a high inter-correlation of independent variables, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on the correlation matrix was employed. To reduce the collinearity of regressions, the models with low condition factor ( k < 30) based on PCA were accepted in this study [70]. To avoid overfitting, the maximum number of predictor variables in each regression model was set to four. The best-fitting models were eventually selected according to the lowest Akaike information criterion (AIC) value [92]. The coefficient of determination (R2), Root-Mean-Square-Error (RMSE) and relative RMSE (rRMSE) were employed to evaluate the performance of predictive models for UWM and FMM parameters. For non-parametric model, all metrics were used as predictors for predicting KNN response sets in MSN and RF imputation. The performance was also assessed using R2, RMSE, and rRMSE. Due to the limited field data available, predictive accuracies were validated by a leave-one-out cross-validation analysis (LOOCV).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.9. Model Creation and Assessment,2

737,"LiDAR predictions (i.e., LiDAR-predicted BC, GC, and LA) were respectively used as means of differentiating between unimodal and multimodal plots. The results of this differentiation are presented in Table 4. For LiDAR predictions of modality differentiation predictors, models for all plots and species-specific plots were separately developed. In comparison, predictions of the non-specific models (i.e., all plots) of BC, GC and LA had relatively lower accuracy than the species-specific models, indicating that the stratification approach according to forest species types may improve the estimates of parameters. GC models had the highest prediction accuracy, followed by LA and BC. For all modality differentiation predictors, both stand metrics (e.g., h50, hcv) and canopy metrics (e.g., Oligo, CvLAD, VCI) were selected by each predicted models. Notably, all of CG, Oligo and CvLAD were the most frequently selected metrics which separately selected by three out of nine models while most other metrics were selected at least twice in nine models. In addition, vertical distribution dependent metrics, such as Lkurt, Oligo and CvLAD contributed to the prediction of distribution-related BC.In terms of these LiDAR predictions for differentiating modality, the predicted Lorenz-based indicators (i.e., GC and LA) produced higher classification accuracies than predicted BC. In addition, the species-specific predicted GC and LA provided the highest classification accuracy, whereas the predicted BC of the non-specific model produced the lowest classification accuracy in terms of overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient. Thus, final unimodal or multimodal plots were classified by LiDAR-predicted GC and LA from the species-specific model.", 3. Results, 3.1. Differentiation of Modality,3
738," 3.2.1. Predictive ModelsAs shown in Table 5, similar to LiDAR-predicted models of BC, GC and LA, the plots with undifferentiated modality were stratified by forest tree species for model development of Weibull parameters (i.e., b and c) derived from a UWM model. As a result, species-specific models yielded better prediction accuracies than the non-specific model (all plots). Two suites of species-specific models performed similarly for predicting b and c. Using predicted GC and LA for identifying modality of plots, 21 unimodal plots and 28 multimodal plots were differentiated (Table 5). The forest type ratio (FTR) of Chinese fir to Eucalypt for 28 unimodal plots was 7/21 and FTR for 21 multimodal plots was 13/8, indicating that most of the Chinese fir plots had uneven tree size distributions whereas most of Eucalypt plots had relative even-sized diameter distributions. UWM and FMM parameters (respectively derived from reference diameter distributions of identified unimodal and multimodal plots) were predicted by LiDAR metrics. The R2, RMSE and rRMSE of predictive b and c for identified unimodal plots ranged from 0.83 to 0.87, 0.71 to 1.74 and from 12.26 to 15.21%, respectively. Regarding the predictions of bimodal Weibull parameters, predictive accuracies of the other five parameters except for b2 were lower than unimodal b and c. However, scale parameters (i.e., b, b1 and b2) produced notably better performance than shape parameters (i.e., c, c1 and c2) regardless of FMM or UWM models. Overall, the predicted second component parameters (R2 = 0.61–0.83, rRMSE = 12.22%–26.66%) of bimodal Weibull model performed better than the first component parameters expect for c2 obtained a relative lower R2 value of 0.61 with a larger RMSE value of 47.42.Each predictive model included standard metrics, and eight of the fourteen models included canopy metrics, except for b and c of UWM for all plots and Eucalypt plots, c of differentiated unimodal plots and b2 of multimodal plots. Specifically, the c model of all plots used the same set of metrics (i.e., d1, d3, d7, d9) that were selected for c model of Eucalypt plots. The most frequently selected height-related metric was hmax, by six out of 14 models. d5 and d7 were the most frequently used density-related metrics, selected by four out of fourteen models. Among all models, the most frequently used canopy metrics were CvLAD and Rumple.Accuracy results for LiDAR-predicted UWM parameters in undifferentiated plots using leave-one-out cross-validation are shown in Figure 3. The b and c for all plots had the lowest accuracies, whereas the b and c of Chinese fir models and that of Eucalypt models produced similar accuracies to one another. Figure 4 shows the cross-validation results of FMM parameters models in differentiated plots. For identified UWM plots, b and c produced same R2 values of 0.83, with RMSE of 12.73% and 14.76%, respectively. For FMM parameters, b2 obtained the highest accuracy, followed by b1, c1, p2, c2, and p2. Overall, the scale parameter models performed better than shape parameter models, indicating LiDAR metrics had a relatively high correlation with scale parameter. 3.2.2. Predicted Parametric Diameter DistributionsBased on the procedure of differentiating modal plots and predicting UWM and FMM parameters with LiDAR, we compared ground-estimated diameter distributions to LiDAR-predicted diameter distributions by using mean values of the two error indices for assessment. The results for different plot types are presented in Table 6. Diameter distributions of undifferentiated plots (Model 1–3) generated by UWM from either ground estimations or LiDAR predictions had a poorer accuracy than those of differentiated unimodal and multimodal plots (Model 4–6). For the two tree species, diameter distributions of Eucalypt plots (Model 3) performed better than those of Chinese fir plots (Model 2). After differentiating the modality of plots, models of multimodal plots (Model 6) produced more accurate diameter distributions, whereas identified unimodal plots (Model 5) had slightly less accurate diameter distributions. Overall, LiDAR-predicted diameter distributions had relative higher errors than ground-estimated diameter distributions, but the accuracies of LiDAR-predicted distributions were acceptable. For differentiated plots, FMM (Model 6) produced higher accuracies than UWM.", 3. Results, 3.2. Unimodal Weibull Model and Finite Mixture Model,3

741,"For MSN and RF imputations, a total of 15 response configurations (Refer to Table 3) were originally compared in different forest types (i.e., all plots, Chinese fir plots and Eucalypt plots). The effect of number of neighbors k was evaluated with SET1 and the results are presented in Table 7. It intuitively found that the values of error indexes were the lowest when k = 5 neighbors for both imputations. The accuracy of predicted diameter distributions from 15 response configurations by MSN and RF imputations are presented in Figure 5. Overall, there was a relatively high difference in mean eR values of MSN-imputed distributions among 15 response configurations compared with RF-imputed distributions. This suggested that the MSN imputation was more sensitive to the selection of response configurations, while RF was much less dependent on the selection of response configurations. As shown in Figure 5 and Table 8, SET14 (i.e., DBH) produced the lowest mean eR value for all plots by RF imputation, whereas SET14 also produced the lowest mean eR value for Eucalypt by MSN imputation. The optimal response configuration for Chinese fir was SET7 (i.e., G, H and DBH) when distribution was imputed by the RF imputation. Table 8 summarizes the optimal response configurations for all plots, Chinese fir and Eucalypt plots, the cross-validation results of imputed responses, and the accuracies of predicted diameter distributions. Regarding the responses, DBH of SET14 imputed by RF imputation produced higher accuracy than DBH of SET14 imputed by MSN imputation. In SET7, H had the highest accuracy (R2 = 0.87, rRMSE = 5.40%), followed by DBH, and G. The LiDAR-predicted distribution of Eucalypt produced the highest accuracy of diameter distribution, followed by Chinese fir, and all plots.Figure 6 displays the scaled importance of top ten predictors that were used for two RF imputation models of Table 8. For the RF-imputed DBH model of all plots (Figure 6a), d3 was the most important variable in the DBH model, followed by the hmax, CvLAD, VCI, Filled, OG, Eu, CC2m and CG. d1 was the least important variable in the top ten variables. For SET7 responses employed in Chinese fir plots, the h75 was the most important metric (Figure 6b), followed by the d1, OG, VCI, hcv, d3, h50, Filled, hmax and CvLAD. For two RF imputation models, except Eu, CC2m and CG in Figure 6a, the other metrics were ranked among the top ten metrics (Figure 6b).", 3. Results, 3.3. KNN Model,3
742,"This study compared three methods for predicting diameter distributions. In terms of the accuracy of diameter distributions, the FMM produced more accurate results than KNN, while UWM produced the lowest accuracies (Table 6 and Table 8). To investigate effects of different stem density for predicting distributions, we chose two groups of four sample plots (i.e., Chinese fir plot 1, 2, 3, 4: Cf1, Cf2, Cf3, Cf4; Eucalypt plot 1, 2, 3, 4: Euc1, Euc2, Euc3, Euc4), including two species with relatively low and high stem density to compare the diameter distributions derived from parametric and non-parametric methods. The two groups were separately differentiated as unimodal plots and multimodal plots by LiDAR-predicted Lorenz-based indicators. For four differentiated unimodal sample plots, the diameter distributions were predicted by Model 1 (i.e., UWM of undifferentiated all plots in Table 6), Model 5 (i.e., UWM of differentiated unimodal plots in Table 6) and Model 7 (i.e., KNN model for all plots in Table 8). The Lorenz curves and the predicted diameter distributions results are shown in Figure 7. For the four differentiated multimodal sample plots, the diameter distributions predicted by Model 1, Model 6 (i.e., FMM for differentiated multimodal plots) and Model 7, and their Lorenz curves are shown in Figure 8. From Figure 7a, the predicted Lorenz curves of unimodal plots lied above the line of perfect uniformity (red dotted line), whereas multimodal ones (Figure 8a) were situated below it, indicating larger inequalities among tree sizes in multimodal plots. Overall, the nonparametric predictions (Model 7) were more irregular than the parametric predictions (Model 1, Model 5 and Model 6). In addition, we found that the ground and LiDAR-predicted diameter distributions were skewed to the right and became more positive kurtosis shapes when stem density increased (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Regarding the performance of predicted distributions of these two group plots, the Model 5 and Model 6 performed the best in each group. As shown in Figure 7a and Figure 8a, generally, the error index exhibited a slightly decreasing trend with increasing stem density, indicating diameter distributions with high stem density may be more easily be fitted by three methods. Unlike Model 1 for unimodal distributions, Model 6 and Model 7 seems more suitable for fitting multimodal distributions. Hence, for multimodal plots, the performance of Model 6 and Model 7 was better than Model 1, except for Model 7 for Cf3 and Euc3. The KNN could produce even more multimodal peaks compared with FMM, but the KNN seemed unstable for characterizing bimodal distributions in our study site. The ground distributions of Cf1 and Cf2 were relatively irregular and tended to be multimodal, which may be caused by differentiation errors brought by errors of LiDAR-predicted Lorenz-based indicators (GC and LA). In fact, Cf1 and Cf2 should be classified as multimodal plots, whereas LiDAR predictions identified them as unimodal plots.", 3. Results, 3.4. Predicted Diameter Distribution in Different Stem Densities,3
743,"Assessing the FSTs of forest stands is critical for understanding tree competition and succession [26,94], accessing silvicultural treatments [73,76] and forest management planning [74]. As a key driver of forest ecosystem process [23,95], FSTs are diversified structures induced by either natural forest regeneration or silvicultural practices [96]. Tree diameter inequality, referring to tree diameter diversity interpreted by differently-shaped diameter distributions [9,76], has been shown to be an important feature for characterizing the structural diversity of diameter distributions [76,97]. Prior knowledge of FSTs is a prerequisite to reliably predict tree diameter distributions of forest stands. In this study, we stratified FSTs into unimodal and multimodal stands by means of examining diameter dispersion (i.e., modality of distributions) using concise indicators of describing tree size inequality.Among a variety of indicators, the GC has been regarded as a consistent descriptor of tree size inequality, outperforming other forest structure indicators characterizing tree size heterogeneity [26]. Lexerød and Eid [76] compared the reliability of a variety of indicators for diameter diversity in boreal forests and they found the GC was the most suitable indicator for assessing stand heterogeneity. Bollandsås and Næsset [14] also used GC to stratify forest areas into different diameter distribution types. However, previous studies [78,98] demonstrated that the same values of GC can be obtained by very different Lorenz curves. For this reason, LA related to the skewness of diameter distributions was developed as a complement to GC in describing tree size inequality [74,78,99]. This study assessed ground-measured and LiDAR-predicted GC and LA derived from Lorenz curves and another statistical indicator, BC, to differentiate unimodal and multimodal stands. The results showed that the LiDAR-predicted Lorenz-based indicators produced higher accuracies (overall accuracy = 59.18%–77.55%) of modality differentiation than BC (overall accuracy = 48.98%–65.31%). In regard to the performance of LiDAR predictions (Table 4), Lorenz-based indicators generally were predicted with relatively high accuracies (R2 = 0.35–0.90, rRMSE = 10.78%–35.80%) compared to BC (R2 = 0.28–0.72, rRMSE = 28.96%–35.80%). The reason for the results may be that Lorenz-based indicators simultaneously included more information of both distributions of stems and their basal areas and therefore were more accurately predicted by LiDAR metrics. This may also explain why Lorenz-based indicators were more appropriate for modality discrimination. Furthermore, the results revealed that LiDAR metrics had more explanatory power for predicting GC than LA, which was similar to the results reported by previous studies [9,74,77]. A reason explaining this result may be the fact that GC could bear more variabilities than LA. Valbuena et al. [97] point out the GC was employed to interpret the composition of vertical strata in a forest and LA described the balance between overstory and understory whereas the balance with low variance was relatively difficult to be characterized by LiDAR metrics. In this study, Lorenz-based indicators from the species-specific model (overall accuracy = 77.55%) were as discrimination indices, which may have a disadvantage with regard to limit the application of this method in this study since we need to know the species of the forest for more accurate modality differentiation. The LiCHy System used for remote data acquisition in this study simultaneously integrates LiDAR (RIEGL LMS-Q680i), CCD camera (DigiCAM-60) and hyperspectral (AISA Eagle II) sensors [63], thus accurate classification of tree-species using airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data in this study should be considered for future work. In addition, more accurate non-specific models (all plots) could be achieved by using either more model forms or using more LiDAR metrics from vertical structure profiles.Chinese fir plots made up most of the stands differentiated as multimodal (FTR = 13/8 in Table 5), indicating that most Chinese fir plots had multimodal or irregular tree size distributions, whereas most Eucalypt plots had relatively even-sized diameter distributions. This may be caused by different silvicultural treatments in different forest types. As cold-tolerant and commercial fast-growing tree species, Eucalypt played an increasingly important role in plantation forestry in southern China after 1990 [100]. Eucalypt planted forest was highly intensive managed with a short rotation, thereby a clear cutting was often chosen as the harvest method for Eucalypt plantation and the even-aged seedlings were planted after large area cutting, which resulted in even-sized or even-aged forest structure with regular or unimodal diameter distributions. Compared to Eucalypt, forests planted with Chinese fir have a longer rotation age and succession and regeneration of stands often undergo periodic commercial thinning operations, which increases tree size inequality and results in more uneven-sized stands with multimodal or irregular diameter distributions.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Differentiation of Modality,4
744,"Multiple regression analysis using LiDAR-derived metrics as independent variables for establishing predictive models for BC, Lorenz-based indicators and parameters of UWM and FMM. A logarithmic transformation was used, as it was found to be suitable for the estimates of forest structure attributes in previous studies [70,101,102]. However, the regression analysis method may involve overfitting the models for small sample data. Thus, the developed FMM for multimodal plots did not consider tree species separation in this study. As shown in Table 4 and Table 5, BC, GC, LA, b and c were predicted by LiDAR-derived metrics in non-specific models (i.e., all plots) and species-specific models. Other studies reported that forest type had a positive impact on predictive models for improving estimates of forest structural attributes [68,89,103,104]. Similarly, the species-specific models obtained higher performance (R2 = 0.44–0.88, rRMSE = 5.13%–28.42%) than the general models (R2 = 0.44–0.88, rRMSE = 5.13%–28.42%) in this study. This can likely be explained by the increasing variability in all plots, including multispecies compared with single tree species plots. Notably, the species-specific models for extrapolation to larger scale also need to acquire more accurate tree species classification maps as a prerequisite in future work. For the predictive models of BC, GC, LA, b and c (Table 4 and Table 5), Chinese fir models generally performed better than Eucalypt models, although b and c of Chinese fir models obtained similar performance to that of Eucalypt models. This may be likely due to the fact that the relationships between forest structure and estimated structural attributes are usually species dependent, and vertical structures of Chinese fir forests are easily characterized, due to their relatively simple and even conical crown structures. In addition, due to more open overstory in Chinese fir forests, LiDAR-derived metrics could capture more full vertical structure information of understory, which may be a potential complement for performance improvement. More variation was explained with the inclusion of canopy metrics to Chinese fir models. The potential of canopy metrics in enhancing an understanding of the physical characteristics of forest canopy structure and improve estimates of structure attributes has been reported in previous studies [68,89]. As shown in Table 4 and Table 5, all Chinese fir models included canopy metrics, which may be another reason explaining slightly better performance in Chinese fir models. Rumple has been demonstrated to be used for characterizing the horizontal complexity of the canopy surface [102,105]. CvLAD metric contains more valuable distribution information on the forest vertical structure [68]. Due to this high correlation with a vertical structure, the CvLAD and Rumple were the most frequently selected in predictive models, indicating their high sensitivity to predicted parameters. Notably, the CvLAD was separately selected by predictive models of BC, GC, LA, b, c and c1, indicating moderate applicability and universality of this metrics for estimating vertical forest structural attributes.Similar to the results by other studies in boreal forests [36,48,102], LiDAR-derived metrics had stronger predictive capabilities for scale parameters (i.e., b, b1 and b2) (R2 = 0.77–0.95, rRMSE = 5.65%–18.74%) than shape parameters (i.e., c, c1 and c2) (R2 = 0.61–0.83, rRMSE = 12.22%–26.66%) regardless of UWM or FMM. The shape parameter is responsible for overall distribution form, which could be an exponential, normal, Weibull or inverse-J distribution, while the scale parameter can control the range of overall distribution. However, the shape of the distribution is often more difficulty characterized by LiDAR metrics than the scale parameter. Similar to the results reported by Thomas et al. [36] and Mulverhill et al. [48], the second component parameters of FMM in this study were more accurately predicted than the first component parameters. A reason explaining this result may be the fact that more mature forest leads to more peaks of the second component of diameter distributions in larger DBH class, which could be easily characterized. Comparing to the performance of LiDAR-predicted parameters of UMM and FMM in Thomas et al. [36] and Mulverhill et al. [48], our results had slightly lower error index accuracy. The cause is likely due to different forest structure in planted forests rather than in unmanaged natural forests.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Predictive Models,4
745,"In this study, a KNN model was employed to predict tree diameter distributions by tree species. To obtain more accurate predictions of diameter distributions and stand attributes, we examined the effects of three imputation strategies, including number of neighbors, response configurations and distance metric (i.e., imputation methods). To shed light on the implication of number neighbors k on fitting diameter distributions, we chose five distribution-related forest structure attributes (i.e., V, G, H, DBH and N) as response variables and carried out a sensitivity analysis of k with a range of 1, 3, 5, 9. After determining the optimal value of k, a total of 15 response sets were examined for their sensitivity to MSN and RF imputations (Table 3). Our results revealed that k = 5 obtained slightly smaller error indices, which was similar to the results reported by Vauhkonen et al. [57]. The optimal k usually depends on the available sample size [57]. Large k shifts the prediction toward the sample mean and may also increase the prediction accuracy [56]. However, for a small sample size, a KNN method with too large or too small k values may lead to less accurate results [49,59]. For KNN imputation by tree species, the total number of plot data (n = 49) in this study still seems to be small, thereby this may explain why the values of error indexes showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing when k increased (Table 7). Figure 5 shows that MSN imputation was more sensitive to the selection of response configurations than RF, which indicates more stability and robustness of RF imputation. With respect to the performance of MSN and RF imputation for diameter distributions, it was found intuitively from Figure 5 that most of RF imputed distributions had higher accuracies than MSN among different response configurations, except that MSN performed slightly better than RF when the response configuration was SET1-2 for all plots, and SET4-5 and SET13-14 for Eucalypt. Similar to Strunk et al. [35] and Shang et al. [59], RF was fairly insensitive to the choice of response configurations and was more robust than MSN. As a robust method against overfitting, the superiority of RF for predicting forest structure attributes had been reported by previous studies [56,57,86,106]. This may be a reason explaining the better performance of RF for diameter distributions with most of the response configurations. Another reason explaining these results may be the fact that RF has an iterative procedure and the average outcome does not describe the worst possible case [57], which may lead to a stable and robust predictive ability of RF for diameter distributions. However, a limitation of RF was that calculating distances is more time-consuming than MSN [35]. As shown in Figure 5, generally, we also found that there was no significant improvement in separate MSN imputations by tree species compared to the imputed diameter distributions for all plots, although there was a significant improvement in RF imputation (Figure 5b). This result was similar to those of Strunk et al. [35] and Räty et al. [37]. This may be explained by the reason that selected neighbors by unstable MSN imputation may include tree species that did not occur in the target plot, due to lower target samples in post-stratification. The sufficient robustness of RF may have only a slightly negative effect on imputed diameter distributions. Our results showed that SET14 (i.e., DBH) was an optimal response configuration for imputing diameter distributions in all plots and Eucalypt plots. Due to meet the needs of predicting diameter distributions in relative complex stands of Chinese fir forests, other responses (i.e., G and H) had to be used in the configurations to increase the capability of searching neighbors for the NN model. Once optimal response configurations and imputation methods were determined for different forest types, the performance of KNN-imputed diameter distributions was evaluated. From Table 8, the diameter distributions of Eucalypt forests derived from MSN imputation performed slightly better than those of Chinese fir forests derived from by RF imputation with the optimal response configuration. This may be explained by Chinese fir forests having larger tree size inequality compared to Eucalypt forests, although a steadier RF model was chosen by Chinese forests.", 4. Discussion," 4.3. The Selection of Number of Neighbors, Response Configurations and Comparisons of MSN and RF Imputations",4
746,"In this study, we investigated the capability of UWM, FMM and KNN for predicting tree diameter distributions. Our results revealed that the inclusion of FMM (Mean eR = 40.85, Mean eP = 0.20) for all plots (Model 4 in Table 6) produced the highest accuracies of diameter distributions, followed by the KNN (Mean eR = 52.19, Mean eP = 0.26) and UWM (Mean eR = 52.31, Mean eP = 0.26) methods (Table 6 and Table 8). The UWM was expected to have the lowest accuracy, because this model form restricts on a simple unimodal distribution in which UWM has the insufficient capability for fully characterizing multimodal diameter distributions in uneven-sized and multi-species stands. However, this parametric method is still applied in ABA forest inventory, because a relatively few parameters that have to be predicted [58]. Compared to UWM, FMM is more flexible for multimodal empirical distributions. This study discriminated multimodal stands using LiDAR-predicted Lorenz-based indicators. An FMM could be more reliable for capturing a complete representation of the continuous bimodal diameter distributions of differentiated bimodal stands, which has been demonstrated [16,36,47,48]. The FMM for multimodal plots from this study produced higher accuracies (Mean eR = 39.38, Mean eP = 0.20) for prediction of diameter distributions than did the results (Mean eR = 62.21) reported by Mulverhill et al. [48] in boreal natural forests, which may be explained by the effects of higher modality differentiation accuracy (overall accuracy = 77.55%). In non-parametric strategies, KNN has the potential to fit multimodal or irregular distributions rather than unimodal or bimodal distributions. For this reason, KNN could easily produce an overfitting diameter distribution for planted stands with relatively simple structures, such as the imputed distribution in Figure 7e. Although no limit on the number of candidate predictor variables, the KNN model produced unstable distributions. Generally, the KNN model is more sensitive to the quality and amount of field reference data, therefore suggesting that KNN may need a larger number of samples for obtaining more reliable results [18,38]. KNN-imputed diameter distributions in this study obtained relative better performance than did the results (Mean eR = 80.16) reported by Rana et al. [18], which may be explained by the latter study area was suited in a subtropical natural forest with relative higher tree size heterogeneity.This study also investigated the effects of stem densities on predicted diameter distributions (Figure 7 and Figure 8). Similar to other studies [39,82], the error index seemly exhibited a slightly decreasing trend with increasing stem density, indicating diameter distributions with high stem density may be more easily be predicted by UWM, FMM and KNN. This may be explained by the fact that the stands with high stem density are often seedlings or young-aged forests and thereby results in relatively low variations.", 4. Discussion," 4.4. Assessing Diameter Distribution Predictions with UWM, FMM and KNN",4
747,"In this study, we provide a framework for using LiDAR data to discriminate forest structural types and to predict plot-level diameter distributions with unimodal and multimodal models (i.e., UWM, FMM and KNN). This framework provides foresters with a mean to improve differentiation of stand structure types and use differentiated types as prior knowledge to select appropriate models for more accurately estimating diameter distributions. This could contribute to improving the selection of stands for harvest, optimization for stand compositions, silvicultural interventions and enhancing growth and yield projections. However, there is still a lot of potential improvements that need to be done in future work. For instance, plot-level diameter distributions prediction should be used for extrapolation to regional areas. This study only used two error indices to assess goodness of fit. To assess diameter distributions more objectively, more assessment indices, such as the balanced error index (BEI) [59], scaled root mean squared distance (sRMSD) [59], modified error index eL [107] and bias [45] could be used. In terms of response configuration of MSN and RF imputations, more structural attributes could be considered as response variables to test, such as basal area weight mean height (Hg) [51], basal area weighted diameter (Dg) [51], Lorey’s mean height (Hlorey) [38], etc. In addition, more parametric (e.g., mixture Gaussian model, trimodal Weibull models) and non-parametric methods (e.g., Bayesian model and 10-percentiles model) could be attempted in future work. Previous studies [51,108] demonstrated the synergy of LiDAR and other optical data sources (e.g., hyperspectral data [109]) to improve estimates of forest structural attributes and diameter distributions. Thus, future work could consider this synergy for developing links between inherent forest structures and their spectral information to enhance the reliability of predicting diameter distributions. To improve direct interpretability and transferability of LiDAR metrics, multimodal distribution models should be used to characterize more detailed information on vertical forest structure profiles for further extracting more LiDAR metrics.", 4. Discussion, 4.5. Applications and Potential Improvements in Future Work,4
748,"This study compared UWM, bimodal FMM, and multimodal KNN models for predicting tree diameter distributions using airborne LiDAR data over a subtropical planted forest within southern China. To better understand forest structural types and predict diameter distributions using UWM and FMM, prior knowledge of forest structural types is required. For this reason, we evaluated the capability of LiDAR predictions for stratifying forest areas into unimodal and multimodal stands by examining the modality of diameter distributions. When modality differentiation was determined, the UWM and FMM were used to fit diameter distributions in unimodal or multimodal stands and KNN model was employed to predict diameter distributions. In addition, the effective strategies of number neighbors, response configurations and imputation methods in the KNN model with tree species were assessed. The result showed that LiDAR-predicted Lorenz-based indicators, i.e., GC and LA, were the most optimal differentiation index (overall accuracy = 77.55%). Parameters of UWM and FMM were predicted well (R2 = 0.58–0.95, rRMSE = 5.69%–29.21%) and species-specific models (R2 = 0.75–0.95, rRMSE = 7.17%–14.94%) had higher accuracies than non-specific models (R2 = 0.80–0.94, rRMSE = 5.65%–16.39%). The number of neighbors k equal to 5 was been found to be optimal with KNN imputations. Overall, RF imputation generally achieved more stable performance than MSN imputation with respect to changes of responses. The optimal response configurations for all plots, Chinese fir and Eucalypt plots were respectively SET14 (DBH), SET7 (G, H and DBH), and SET14 (DBH). Furthermore, compared to the UWM (Mean eR = 52.31, Mean eP = 0.26) method on all plots, FMM and KNN generally produced better performance (Mean eR = 40.85–52.19, Mean eP = 0.20–0.26) for predicting diameter distributions. Multimodal KNN model could be expected to provide valuable insights into multimodal diameter distributions in more heterogeneous planted forests with more complex structure. This study demonstrated benefits of multimodal models with LiDAR data to predict diameter distributions and showed that FMM has the great potential to predict diameter distributions and can be a valuable tool for supporting sustainable forest management in subtropical planted forests.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
749,"Human activities and natural processes are rapidly changing the global distribution and structure of forests [1]. The subsequent changes in forest biomass are thought to dominate changes in net terrestrial carbon flux, altering the global carbon cycle, affecting species diversity, and changing Earth’s climate [1,2,3]. However, the total amount of carbon contained in forest’s biomass and subsequently the future state of the terrestrial Carbon sink remain highly uncertain [4]. Constraining this uncertainty is paramount to safeguarding the future of our planet not least through informing sustainable local forest management policies, forest-based natural climate solutions, and international carbon emission reduction initiatives [5,6,7,8].Spatially contiguous information on forest 3D structure is needed to better resolve forest biomass distribution and net terrestrial carbon flux [9,10,11,12,13]. Indeed, a number of quantitative and observable 3D forest structure characteristics (canopy cover, canopy height, leaf area index, and vertical foliage distribution) are essential for modeling the true magnitude of global forest biomass stocks as they exist today [14], modeling biomass change associated with forest disturbance and regrowth [15], modeling current and future net forest carbon flux [16], and for understanding the impacts of forest 3D structure changes on habitat and biodiversity [17].While satellite-based observations have been successfully used to monitor changes in forest cover and leaf area index [18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28], the 3D structure of forests continues to be the most crucial information gap in the observational archive [10]. To fill this ongoing gap in observations of forest canopy structure, the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) was installed on the Japanese Experiment Module-Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) on board the International Space Station (ISS) in December of 2018. GEDI is a full waveform Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) instrument. GEDI has been collecting data between 51.6° N and S latitude, covering the tropical and temperate forests of the Earth. Over its two-year nominal lifetime (April 2019–April 2021), GEDI is anticipated to provide over 10 billion cloud-free waveforms at a footprint resolution of 25 m. The distribution of the laser energy in the GEDI waveform is being used in [29,30] to derive the height, horizontal coverage, and vertical distribution of plant material within the GEDI ~25m footprint.GEDI is specifically designed for measuring vegetation structure [10]. Pre-launch calibration and validation studies that simulated GEDI waveforms from Airborne LiDAR Instruments (ALS) suggested that GEDI products can be used as a reference data [31,32,33,34]. However, the accuracies of post launch GEDI data and products might differ from the accuracies of the ALS-simulated GEDI data due to, for example, geolocation inaccuracies and spatiotemporal variations in atmospheric attenuation. A robust post-launch validation is therefore needed to assess the accuracy of GEDI science data products. A robust validation requires contemporaneous reference data (e.g., Terrestrial Laser Scanning and Airborne Laser Scanning data) collocated with on-orbit GEDI data that encompass a broad range of tropical and temperate vegetation types. To date, two studies produced an assessment of the accuracy of on-orbit GEDI-derived canopy height product [9,35]. These studies produced divergent assessments of the GEDI canopy height product. However, these studies used ALS data with acquisition dates spanning 2012 to 2017. It is possible that forest growth and disturbance in the intervening period between GEDI data and ALS reference data acquisitions influenced the findings in [9,35]. The limited set of GEDI-coincident ground and airborne reference data are being expanded with dedicated ALS campaigns and with community contributed field and airborne LiDAR data [10]. Once available, a more complete validation of the GEDI products will become attainable. The GEDI footprint level data is providing a limited sample of tropical and temperate forest 3D structure. Integration of LiDAR sample data with wall-to-wall radar and optical data archives (e.g., from Landsat, Sentinel-1/Sentinel-2 satellites, Tandem-X,, and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)) provides the opportunity for contiguous multi-annual to multi-decadal monitoring of 3D vegetation structure at spatial scales of 1-km or less. For instance, the integration of ALS and Landsat data enabled the multi-decadal analysis of forest extent and structural changes at national [36] and regional [37] scales. A global map of tree height at 30-m resolution for the year 2019 was recently produced in [9] by integrating GEDI and Landsat data. GEDI measurements could also be used to enhance the development of training and validation data needed for generating global surface type products from VIIRS and other global observing systems [38,39].In this paper, we investigate the potential of extrapolating GEDI-derived forest structure attributes into 1-km resolution spatially-contiguous maps of tree height (TH), canopy fraction cover (CFC), plant area index (PAI), and foliage height diversity (FHD) for the conterminous US (CONUS) using Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) annual metrics data. Foliage height diversity is a canopy structural index that describes the vertical heterogeneity of foliage profile [40].VIIRS data was utilized in this study because it extends and improves upon a series of measurements initiated by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and the Operational Linescan System (OLS). Due to their similar spatial resolution and spectral response functions, mapping methods developed for VIIRS should be applicable for MODIS data, thus providing the opportunity for operational multi-decadal monitoring of key forest structural attributes from the 2000 MODIS first images until the nominal life expectancy of the fourth VIIRS instrument expected to last through 2031 [41].", 1. Introduction,None,1.
750,"The VIIRS has 16 bands with a nadir resolution of 750 m (M-bands) and five bands with a 375 m nadir resolution (I-bands). Following previous MODIS and VIIRS-based global vegetation and land cover studies [22,24,39,42,43,44], 9 of the 16 VIIRS M-bands were processed (Table 1) to create a set of multi-temporal spectral metrics to serve as consistent land surface phenology inputs for mapping 3-dimensional canopy structure. This section provides an overview of VIIRS data processing. More details have been described in previous studies [22,39,44].The VIIRS swath level surface reflectance data for the year 2019 were obtained from the NOAA’s Comprehensive Large Array-Data Stewardship System (CLASS). The swath data were then projected into a sinusoidal projection and mosaicked into global daily data following the method described in [39]. The spatial resolution of the global mosaic daily data was 926.65 m. These daily mosaics were then aggregated to create 5-day and 32-day composites using the self-adaptive compositing approach which employs spectral and temporal information to determine the general surface cover condition (e.g., vegetation/land, water, snow/ice) of a given pixel and adaptively select the most suitable compositing criterion for that pixel [44]. The monthly composited values were used to create the annual spectral and phenology metrics using the methods described in [19,39]. Compositing reduces temporal inconsistencies associated with clear-sky data availability, cloud shadow and snow cover contamination [45] and hence may allow more consistent mapping of vegetation structure [19,22,24].In addition to the composite spectral data and phenology statistics, the VIIRS-derived annual surface type data [8,10,14], data from the VIIRS Global Land Surface Phenology product (VNP22Q2) [23], and the geographic position of each pixel encoded in coordinates of latitude (−90–90°) and longitude (−180–180°) were also incorporated into the multi-temporal metrics. VNP22Q2 data were resampled from its native resolution of 463.325 m to the MODIS sinusoidal 926.65 m grid by averaging the values of the 4 spatially coincident 463.325 m pixels. The incorporated data from the VNP22Q2 product were the salient transition dates of the phenology cycle (start, peak, onset of senescence, and end of the plant growth season), the length of the plant growth cycle, the growth season integrated two band enhanced vegetation index (EVI2) [46], and the rates of change in EVI2 values during the vegetation growth and senescence phases. The inclusion of geographic position was based on the hypothesis that because large scale climate patterns exert strong control on the geographic distribution of vegetation biomes, geographic position serves as a good predictor of land cover and vegetation class at continental to global scales [43]. Table 2 provides a full list of the multi-temporal metrics used to produce the wall-to-wall maps of CFC, CH, PAI, and FHD.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. VIIRS Multitemporal Metrics,2
751,"GEDI detectors record the amount of laser energy reflected by earth 3D structures at different heights above the ground [10,29]. The recorded energy as a function of distance is the GEDI waveform. The GEDI instrument is comprised of 3 lasers, one of which is split into two beams (“coverage” beams), while the other two remain at full power (“power” beams). At any one time, 4 beams, each with footprint diameter of approximately 25 m, are incident on the ground. Each of these 4 beams is then dithered every other shot across track, to produce 8 tracks of data, separated by about 600 m across the flight track direction. For any one track, footprint centers are separated by 60 m along track. Over the 2-year mission, GEDI is expected to acquire waveform data for ~10 billion cloud-free footprints [10]. The distribution of the laser energy within the GEDI ~25 m footprints was used in [29,30] to determine the height, canopy cover, and vertical distribution of plant material. A detailed description of the GEDI L2B footprint canopy cover and vertical profile metrics can be found in [30]. In the GEDI L2B product, the first and last modes (i.e., the detected signal above noise) within the GEDI waveform have been associated with the highest and lowest perceived reflecting surfaces [30]. Adam et al. [35] compared GEDI L2B canopy height data calculated from the first and last modes of the GEDI waveform (rh100) to the maximum of ALS-derived crown canopy height. Potapov et al. [9], on the other hand, compared GEDI relative height metrics data (rh90, rh95, and rh100) to the 90th percentile distribution of ALS-based forest canopy height data. The comparisons in [9] produced similar precision values (r2 = ~0.7) but the metric rh90 underestimated canopy height (mean difference 2.3 m) and rh100 overestimated (mean difference −2.7 m) compared to rh95 (mean difference 0.7 m). However, vegetation growth from the time of acquisition of ALS reference data (2012–2017) to the time of acquisition of GEDI data (2019) might have influenced the comparisons in [9]. In this study, the relative height difference between the first and last modes (rh100) was used to represent canopy height (CH).In addition to plant canopy height, the GEDI LiDAR waveform was used in [30] to derive canopy fraction cover (CFC), plant area index (PAI), and foliage height diversity (FHD). The GEDI-derived CFC is the percent of the ground covered by the vertical projection of canopy material (i.e., leaves, branches, and stems). CFC accounts for the gaps between and within the canopy [10,30] and is therefore different from other commonly used definitions such as the “crown cover” definition in [47] which does not account for within plant canopy gaps.The GEDI-derived PAI is related to Leaf Area Index (LAI) defined as one half of the total leaf area per unit ground surface but differs from LAI in that it incorporates, in addition to leaves, all canopy structural elements [30]. Finally, the GEDI-derived FHD is calculated from the PAI vertical profile (Equation (1)) and is a measure of the complexity of canopy structure with higher FHD values often associated with multiple canopy layers [48].

This section provides an overview of the quality flags used in this study. A more complete description of the quality flags is provided in [29,30]. The waveform “sensitivity” flag provides an estimate for the relative minimum percentage of the waveform energy return that needs to be present in the ground for it to be detected. The “sensitivity” flag therefore aids in identifying the ability of waveforms to penetrate canopies and detect the ground level. The “quality” flag is an aggregation of several individual quality assessment parameters and is intended to provide end users with the ability to easily remove erroneous and/or lower quality returns. The “degrade” flag indicates whether the recorded waveform contains saturated intensities. Saturated waveforms are flagged since they do not accurately represent the return photon flux and might degrade the precision of the ground elevation and canopy height measurements.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. The GEDI Data,2
752,"The GEDI level 02B product data granules [49] over North America were obtained for the two months of June and July 2019. Data from June and July were selected since for most of the conterminous US, except for some arid areas, tree canopy during the selected period is at or near full leaf out [23]. The obtained data contained 254,550,672 GEDI level 02B footprints of tree height, canopy cover, and vertical distribution of plant material. To select the highest quality data, the GEDI data were further filtered to remove the waveforms flagged as unsuitable for measuring canopy structure (“Quality flag” = 1), flagged as detector-saturated (“Degrade flag” = 1), or had sensitivity values <0.95. The sensitivity value of 0.95 was selected to reduce the proportion of false positive ground returns [50]. The application of these filters removed most of the data collected from the GEDI “coverage” beams, cloud-contaminated observations, and observations taken over water bodies [9,10]. The filtering resulted in a subset of 27,361,244 GEDI footprints or ~10.75% of the data collected over the study area during the two months of June and July.The remaining GEDI level 02B data were then mapped into the VIIRS standard global 1-km Sinusoidal grid system. This resulted in 1,324,640 of collocated VIIRS-GEDI paired data records. The number of GEDI footprints falling within a collocated VIIRS grid cell ranged between 1 and 29 observations except for the VIIRS grid cells where the ascending and descending GEDI tracks intersected. In the latter case, the maximum number of GEDI observations falling within a VIIRS grid cell reached a maximum of 59 observations. Some 349,634 (or 26.4%) of the collocated VIIRS-GEDI grid cells contained 20 or more GEDI footprints and 580,744 (or 43.8%) of the collocated VIIRS-GEDI grid cells contained 10 or less GEDI footprints. The remaining VIIRS grid cells (394,471) contained 11 to 19 GEDI footprints.The average values of GEDI products within the coincident VIIRS grid cells were calculated in order to investigate the relation between VIIRS and GEDI data products. The output are metrics of GEDI-VIIRS paired collections. However, only GEDI-VIIRS paired collections calculated from 20 or more GEDI observations were retained. The selection of the cutoff value of 20 was made to minimize the errors associated with under-sampling of GEDI observations within a VIIRS grid cell while maintaining a sufficiently large sample of GEDI-VIIRS paired collections that can capture variations in canopy structure across the study area. The resulting GEDI-VIIRS metrics contained 349,634 paired records relating VIIRS data to GEDI-derived CH, CFC, PAI, and FHD.The GEDI-VIIRS paired collections were split into calibration and validation subsets. The calibration subset was drawn from a random sampling of half of the downloaded GEDI tracks. The validation subset were derived from the remaining GEDI tracks (Figure 1). Selecting independent GEDI tracks for model calibration and validation, especially when the geographic position is included as an explanatory variable, should reduce the impacts of spatial autocorrelation on model validation results [43,51]. The resulting GEDI-VIIRS training subset contained 162,477 paired records, whereas the validation metrics contained 187,157 paired VIIRS-GEDI records. ", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. GEDI Data Processing ,2
753,"The paired GEDI-VIIRS calibration data were used to train four random forest regression models [52] that can predict GEDI-like CH, CFC, PAI, and FHD. In total, 159 VIIRS-derived multi-temporal phenology metrics (Table 2) were used as input features (i.e., independent variables) in model construction.Random forest regression models are an ensemble learning method. The method grows a user-defined number of regression trees and averages their predictions. In random forests, each tree in the ensemble (i.e., forest) is built from a sample drawn with replacement (i.e., a bootstrap sample) from the training set. Furthermore, when splitting each node during the construction of a tree, the best split is found either from all input features or from a random subset of inputs defined by the user [52]. The size of the subset of inputs and other regression tree model hyper-parameters (e.g., number of trees in the forest, the maximum depth of the regression trees, the minimum number of training samples required to split a node, and the minimum number of training sample to form a leaf) that produce optimal model performance can be estimated by an exhaustive search over user specified parameter values or through a randomized sampling from a user specified distribution of parameters settings [53].To optimize model performance, the hyper-parameter values of the random forest models were approximated through a randomized sampling of 300 parameter setting. The 300 hyper-parameter samples were obtained from the distributions outlined in Table 3. Accordingly, a total of 1200 random forest models were evaluated (300 for each of the four random forest regression models). A randomly selected subset of the calibration data (15% of the calibration dataset) were used to search for the optimal hyper-parameter values. The use of only 15% of calibration data to tune the hyper-parameters of the models was done to maintain a reasonable utilization of computing resources.The hyper-tuned random forest model parameters that better explained the out of bag sample variances of the GEDI-derived CH, CFC, PAI, and FHD (i.e., the models with the highest evaluated r2 value) were retained (Table 4). The retained hyper-parameters were subsequently used to calibrate four random forest regression models using the complete training dataset of 162,477 paired GEDI-VIIRS records. Model hyper-parameter and model calibration were performed using the Scikit-learn platform in Python [53].Model validation was performed on the independent validation sample of 187,157 GEDI-VIIRS paired records derived from the GEDI granules not used in model calibration (see Section 2.3 for more details). The spatial distribution of the validation sample is shown in Figure 1. The four calibrated random forest regression models were then used to predict the four canopy structural elements CH, CFC, PAI, and FHD using VIIRS phenology metrics as model inputs. These VIIRS-derived CH, CFC, PAI, and FHD were compared to their corresponding GEDI-derived values in order to evaluate the performances of the four random forest regression models. The evaluation criteria were the ability of the models to explain the variances observed in the GEDI-derived canopy structural elements (R squared values as a measure of the precision of the models); and the accuracy of the four models measured by calculating the mean and median absolute errors as well as the root mean-squared error (RMSE). We also investigated model bias by calculating the distribution of differences between model-derived canopy structural elements and their corresponding GEDI-derived values at multiple intervals of the variables’ distribution.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Calibration and Validation of the Random Forest Regression Models ,2
754,"The calibrated random forest regression models were applied to the 2019 multi-temporal phenology metrics (Table 2) in order to produce wall-to-wall maps of canopy height, fraction canopy cover, plant area index, and foliage height diversity index for the conterminous US. In producing the wall-to-wall maps, water bodies were not processed since the GEDI data used in model calibration did not include observations over water. The 926.65-m grid size water mask was calculated from the global 231.66-m land/water product [54]. Any 926.65-m was flagged as a water pixel if any of the 16 spatially coincident pixels in the original product were classified as water pixels. Summary statistics and histograms were used to assess variations in the spatial distribution of the VIIRS-derived forest attribute values between ecoregions. The ecoregion boundaries used were the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) level 1 and level 3 ecoregion boundaries. EPA ecoregions are identified by analyzing the patterns and composition of biotic and abiotic phenomena that affect or reflect differences in ecosystem quality and integrity [55,56,57]. Spatial patterns of forest structure attributes were expected to conform to the boundaries of EPA ecoregions since the biotic and abiotic phenomena used to delineate the ecoregions include geology, landforms, soils, vegetation, climate, and land use; all factors known to influence potential natural vegetation, its type and structure. ", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Derivation and Assessment of Vegetation Structure Attributes for CONUS,2
755,"Results from the comparison of the VIIRS-derived canopy attributes with their corresponding GEDI-derived attributes are summarized in Table 5. The precision (degree to which variations in GEDI-derived values were explained by the models) of the FHD model was higher (r2 = 0.83) than that for the other models with the PAI model having the lowest precision (r2 = 0.76).When calculated over the entire data range, comparisons between the modeled and GEDI-derived values had negligible bias and offset values (Figure 2). However, when the distribution of the differences between the VIIRS-derived and the GEDI-derived values were plotted for strata representing intervals drawn from the range of each canopy attribute, it was noticed that the canopy height model underestimated GEDI-derived canopy height data for tall (>27 m) forests and the Plant Area Index model underestimated the GEDI-derived Plant Area Index at index values greater than 2 (Figure 3). Underestimation of fraction tree cover in denser forests were less pronounced while the comparisons of FHD values showed good correspondence between the modeled and reference data for all strata (Figure 4).", 3. Results, 3.1. Random Forest Model Validation,3
756,"The four random forest regression models were used to extrapolate from GEDI products wall-to-wall maps of canopy height, canopy fraction cover, plant area index, and foliage height diversity for the conterminous US using the phenology metrics derived from the observations acquired by the VIIRS instrument onboard the NOAA-20 satellite for the year 2019. Overlaying the EPA ecoregions on these maps showed distinct variations in the spatial patterns of forest structure attributes between EPA level III ecoregions (Figure 5 and Figure 6). This was expected since the factors that were used to delineate the ecoregion boundaries reflect the aggregate of geographic characteristics (both natural and anthropogenic) that determine potential vegetation, its type, horizontal distribution, and vertical profiles. The remainder of this section further examines the relation of EPA ecoregions to the VIIRS-derived forest attributes. The VIIRS-modeled canopy height map (Figure 5a) demonstrated canopy height (CH) variations across natural forest and ecoregion types in the conterminous US. The tallest modeled tree heights were in the Klamath Mountains and the Cascades of the Northwestern Forested Mountains as well as in the coast range of the Marine West Coast Forests (Figure 5c). These ecoregions are habitats for very tall conifer species including the coast Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii ssp. menziesii), the Western Red Cedar (Thuja plicata), the coast Redwood (Sequoia sempervirens), and Sitka Spruce (Picea sitchensis). The next modeled tallest trees were in the North Cascades, Eastern Cascade slopes and foothills, and in the northern reaches of the Sierra Nevada range. These regions are also home to the tall coniferous species of Douglas-fir, Western Red Cedar, and Jeffrey pine (Pinus jeffreyi). Similarly, modeled tree height results suggest that some forested regions in the Northern Rockies are also taller than the Eastern temperate forests and the Northern Hardwood Forests of the US (Figure 5a and Figure 7a). Modeled canopy height values in the Eastern Temperate forests also show height variation related to natural forest types, clearly separating taller Appalachian and Blue Ridge Mountain forests from lower canopy height forests of the Piedmont Plateau, the Southeastern Plains, and the Southern Coastal Plains (Figure 5a). However, the forests of the Piedmont Plateau were, in general, taller than the northern hardwood forests of the Great Lakes (Figure 7b).Results from the canopy fraction cover (CFC) model showed several ecoregions with expansive forests characterized by high percentage canopy cover (Figure 5b). For example, the landscapes of the Blue Ridge and the Central Appalachians (Figure 5d) had a median VIIRS-derived percentage canopy cover greater than 55%. In general, most of the natural forest types of the Eastern Temperate forests had a median VIIRS-derived canopy fraction cover exceeding that of the forests of the Northwestern Forested Mountains except for the sub ecoregions of the cascades and the Coast Range (Figure 7c). The latter sub-regions had median percentage cover values comparable to the Eastern Temperate Forests and the Northern hardwood forests.VIIRS-modeled Plant Area Index (PAI) values were found to be higher in forests with tall trees and high percentage canopy cover (Figure 6a). Large areas of the Blue Ridge and the Central Appalachians had PAI values greater than 2.75. In comparison, fewer forested areas had PAI values greater than 2.75 in the South-Western Appalachians, the Western Allegheny Plateau, and in the Northwestern parts of the Interior Plateau (Figure 6c). Some patches of the tall forests in the Cascades, Coast Range, and to a lesser extent in the Klamath mountains ecoregions had VIIRS modeled PAI values between 2.0 and 2.75. Large areas with relatively high VIIRS-modeled PAI values were also found in Ouachita/Boston Mountains ecoregions, and Northern Appalachian/Maritime Highlands. Except for the Cascades and Coast range, most of the Northwestern Forested Mountains had lower PAI than the Northern Hardwood Forests and the Eastern Temperate Forests (Figure 7d).The spatial arrangements of the VIIRS-modeled foliage height diversity (FHD) values showed different spatial patterns from those for PAI, CFC, and CH (Figure 6b). Compared to other ecoregions with similar canopy height, and canopy fraction cover, the FHD values over large areas of the Sierra Nevada range were surprisingly high (Figure 6d). Similarly, the relatively shorter and sparse coniferous forests of the Middle and Southern Rockies ecoregions had, on average, similar FHD values to the taller and denser canopies of Klamath Mountains. In general, median FHD values were highest in the Northwestern Forested Mountains followed by the Eastern temperate forest, and the lowest median FHD values were modeled for the Northern Hardwood Forests (Figure 7e). The distribution of very high FHD values were in the sub-regions of the Appalachians, Ouachita/Boston Mountains ecoregion, the Cascades, Klamath Mountains, and large swaths of the Sierra Nevada range (Figure 6b). The multiband color rendering of CH (red band), CFC (green band), and PAI (blue band) further illustrates how these three forest structural attributes vary across the CONUS (Figure 7a). The color intensity of the Red-Green-Blue bands in Figure 7a is linearly related to the spatial distribution of its corresponding forest structure attribute values. Compared to other forests in the CONUS, forests with relatively high CH, CFC, and PAI values are rendered in white tones such as in the Marine West Coast Forests, the Cascades, and Central Appalachians. Darker red/orange tones such as in the central and northern Rockies represent more open canopy with relatively tall trees. Darker green tones such as in the Piedmont Plateau represent dense canopy with relatively shorter trees. Black tones in Figure 7a are non-forested areas.", 3. Results, 3.2. Wall-to-Wall Maps of Canopy Structure for the Conterminous US,3
757,"After its nominal two-year lifetime, GEDI will have covered the majority of 1-km cells between 51.6° N and S with two or more ground tracks [34]. However, cloud contamination, track spacing, clumping in the ISS orbital tracks, and removal of GEDI waveforms unsuitable for measuring canopy structure can result in large coverage gaps at the 1-km grid [31,58]. In this study, only 10.75% of the GEDI footprints were retained after filtering out waveforms flagged as “low quality” and waveforms with a sensitivity value <0.95. The estimation of forest structure attributes for the 1-km grid cells that have few or zero “high quality” GEDI waveforms can benefit from using statistical models that integrate GEDI-derived forest structure data with wall-to-wall satellite images [31,58]. Similarly, the GEDI L4B 1-km gridded science data product will use statistical models that utilize wall-to-wall satellite images to estimate above ground biomass in grid cells with less than two coincident GEDI ground tracks [10]. This study demonstrated the potential of using random forest regression models and VIIRS data to extrapolate the GEDI-derived forest structure attributes into wall-to-wall maps of CH, CFC, PAI, and FHD. It should be noted that the GEDI and VIIRS-derived PAI are different from True PAI and LAI since large-footprint LiDAR systems cannot directly measure leaf clumping or leaf angle distribution. End users are therefore recommended to apply conversions based on their best knowledge to convert GEDI’s PAI to true PAI and LAI for running earth system models [30].The accuracy of the modeled results in this study depended on several factors, notably the quality and availability of reference LiDAR data, the quality and consistency of the optical VIIRS data, and any limitations of the ability of the statistical models, to accurately predict the outputs without bias. One factor which could have affected the generalization ability of the models was the number of cloud-free “high-quality” GEDI observations used to calculate the mean values of the canopy structural attributes within the 1-km VIIRS grid cell. The number of GEDI observations ranged between 20 and 59. Especially in heterogeneous landscapes, under-sampling can result in high mean standard errors [59] and thus in inaccurate representation of canopy structural attributes at the 1-km resolution grid cell [34,43]. The availability of GEDI observations is expected to increase as soon as the data collected during the full leaf-out period in 2020 become publically available. Furthermore, the expected future availability of more GEDI data will increase the size of the GEDI-VIIRS training sample for some of the currently underrepresented surface types (e.g., human settlements and landscapes with frequent cloud cover). Therefore, the expected increase in GEDI data availability should increase the accuracy of model outputs.In addition to GEDI data availability, other issues still exist in GEDI data that can affect model performance. Surface slopes, for instance, can affect tree height estimation by LiDAR instruments [60,61]. While the GEDI footprint size was selected to limit the vertical mixing of vegetation and ground signals caused by surface slope [10], comparisons of the GEDI height metric (RH95) with airborne laser scanning (ALS) data in [9] revealed that RH95 tends to overestimate canopy height in areas of complex topography and sparse tree cover. Additional corrections of the footprint-level data may therefore be required to reduce slope-induced canopy height uncertainty [9]. Furthermore, residual geolocation errors of GEDI data were also found to affect the calibration and validation of the statistical models [9]. Currently available GEDI data from [62] has a horizontal geolocation accuracy between 10 and 20 meters [10] which was found to affect the performance of Landsat-based tree height models [9]. Future calibration process is expected to reduce the geolocation error down to 8 m horizontal [10]. Nonetheless, the impacts of surface slopes and residual geolocation errors on the results of this study should be less pronounced than the impacts surmised in studies utilizing higher spatial resolution optical data [9]. Aggregating LiDAR data to a 1-km grid cell size is expected to reduce model uncertainty due to spatial averaging of errors [5,59,63,64,65,66]. For instance, the impacts of LiDAR positioning errors on biomass prediction errors [63,64] and on the prediction errors of tree canopy attributes [66] were all found to decrease exponentially with mapping resolution [59]. A theoretical analysis on how spatial aggregation can reduce spatial random noise and improve the accuracy and precision of predictive models is presented in [67].In addition to inherent errors in GEDI data, validation results using the reserved sample of 187,157 VIIRS-GEDI observations showed an underestimation of canopy height for tall (>27m) forests and an underestimation of Plant Area Index at index values greater than 2.5. Other studies integrating LiDAR and optical data using regression forests (RF) or regression trees similarly reported an underestimation of tree height in tall forests [9,68]. This might be due to (1) the problematic behavior of the random forest regression models in situations where the training and prediction inputs differ in their range and/or distributions (i.e., covariate shift); (2) the low sampling rate in the training data of very tall forests; (3) the loss of sensitivity of optical data, especially in the visible spectrum, to increasing LAI/PAI values [26,27,69]; and (4) due to the previously discussed errors in the GEDI training data. Highly localized calibration of Landsat-based models of canopy height were found in [70] to improve model performance and reduce model biases at either edge of the data range. Substituting RF models with Deep Learning models might reduce model biases at the higher end of the distribution of canopy height and PAI values. Indeed, recent applications of deep learning (DL) regression models to retrieve continuous canopy structural attributes [68,71,72] showed promising results. DL models were found in [68] to outperform RF models in mapping canopy height in Northwestern China. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to Sentinel-2 data to estimate vegetation height were demonstrated to have better sensitivity to the taller canopy heights in [72] than RF models applied to Landsat data in [9] and to VIIRS-data in this study.It should be stressed that while the resulting 1-km VIIRS-derived maps of forest attributes showed good agreements with the GEDI-validation data, the GEDI-VIIRS comparisons cannot be construed as accuracy assessments of the derived 1-km maps. These comparisons are a representation of the ability of the models to extrapolate GEDI-like forest structure attributes across the CONUS. A robust accuracy assessment should consider the errors in the GEDI-derived products. Results from the GEDI pre-launch calibration and validation studies suggested GEDI ability to measure subtle variations in the complex vertical canopy structure [50] at sub-meter vertical accuracy [10,30]. Several studies also demonstrated the added value of incorporating simulated GEDI data into models that map forest structure and biomass from space-born Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data [31,58,73]. However, the accuracies of post launch GEDI data and products might differ from the accuracies of the ALS-simulated GEDI data due to, for example, geolocation inaccuracies, and spatiotemporal variations in atmospheric attenuation. A robust post-launch validation is needed to assess the accuracy of GEDI science data products. A robust post-launch validation requires contemporaneous reference data (e.g., Terrestrial Laser Scanning and Airborne Laser Scanning data) that are collocated with on-orbit GEDI data, and encompasses a broad range of tropical and temperate vegetation types. The acquisition and processing of these data is a global collaborative effort that is being coordinated by the GEDI calibration and validation program. These reference data, once available, will be used by the GEDI team to validate GEDI performance against design requirements, assess the repeatability of the GEDI level 1 and 2 product variables, and verify their accuracy [10]. Other approaches are currently being tested to produce 1-km or finer scale wall-to-wall maps of 3D vegetation structure. These include a spatially interpolated GEDI-derived level 3 gridded canopy vegetation metrics [10], the fusion of GEDI with interferometric SAR [31,58,74,75], and the fusion of GEDI and ICESAT-2 data with moderate (10–30 m) resolution optical remote sensing data [9,68,72]. While Sentinel-1/2 and Landsat data were utilized to derive tree height and tree cover products at much finer spatial detail [9,68,72] than the VIIRS-derived products, they can be subject to data gaps in cloudy regions and in regions with sparse Landsat/Sentinel-2 data record. Compared to finer spatial resolution sensors, the VIIRS very high data acquisition rate reduces the effects of clouds and incomplete atmospheric correction on the temporal consistency of VIIRS data which should in turn reduce spatial and inter-annual fluctuations in modeled results that would otherwise be caused by atmospheric contamination. Furthermore, the generalization ability of parametric and non-parametric statistical models was found to be inversely related to spatial scale [59,64] as a results of the spatial aggregation of errors [5,63,64,65] and because aggregation reduces the contamination of a pixel reflectance values from reflected light originating beyond the pixel’s area (i.e., aggregation reduces the impacts of the sensor’s point spread function or PSF) [76].Improving the accuracy of the statistical models will enable a more precise analysis of inter-annual and multi-decadal forest dynamics. Robust models will enable the annual monitoring of changes in forest structural attributes. This is essential for monitoring post disturbance forest regrowth, forest degradation, and carbon emissions from land conversions. It is expected that more robust models can be achieved by (1) the increased availability of the GEDI data; (2) the planned improvements to the GEDI data and the quality of its products [9,10]; (3) and tuning the hyper-parameters and parameters of deep learning algorithms.", 4. Discussion,None,4
758,"Accurate, multi-year, 3D vegetation structure data at spatial resolutions of 1-km or less are needed by the ecosystem science community to constrain the errors associated with modeling above ground biomass (AGBM), Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), and Carbon fluxes associated with forest disturbance events and post-disturbance forest recovery [1]. The higher the accuracy of the derived 3D vegetation structure, the more feasible it is to precisely model biomass and Carbon fluxes especially where the scale of mapping matches the important scales of vegetation dynamics and the underlying environmental gradients [1].This study demonstrated the feasibility of integrating GEDI-derived tree canopy structure data with VIIRS-derived multi-temporal phenology metrics to produce contiguous maps of tree canopy height, canopy fraction cover, plant area index, and foliage height diversity. Unfortunately, the limited availability of reference data did not allow for a robust accuracy assessment that considers the propagation of the errors that resulted from using the modeled GEDI forest structure products. Nevertheless, if the GEDI-derived tree canopy data do provide a valid representation of canopy 3D structure as suggested by GEDI pre-launch validation studies, the VIIRS-derived maps produced in this study can assist in modeling the true magnitude of global forest biomass stocks and for prognosticating future trends in the strength of the land carbon sink.Future endeavors will focus on increasing the robustness of the statistical models to enable multi-decadal monitoring of forest dynamics at global scale using the entire VIIRS-NPP and MODIS data records. Extending the methods presented in this study to global coverage may require training separate models for each biome or for each vegetation type as suggested in [9,72] in order to overcome the limitations of model overfitting when employing very large training datasets. Furthermore, it will be worthwhile to evaluate the potential of developing global 3D vegetation structure data using the VIIRS 350m I bands with a precision that is sufficient to calculate about 80% accurate 500 m biomass maps as this would represent a significant advance forward and provide the most accurate baseline map of carbon stocks to date [10].", 5. Conclusions,None,5
759,"Remote Sensing (RS) is one of the technologies that has been currently most employed in the forestry sector for monitoring, inventorying, and mapping purposes. RS techniques with the aim to obtain information on large areas can be conducted at different levels of precision, according to the different goals to be achieved. The choice of the RS platform to be employed, and consequently the sensors installed and operating on-board that specific platform will depend on the processes under investigation and the level of detail required for a particular analysis [1].RS platform as satellite systems, aircraft platforms and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have features that differ in terms of spatial resolution, surface covered, temporal resolution, operational procedures, and costs. Satellite solutions remain a fundamental tool for long-term and extensive monitoring and surveillance forestry activities against fire events [2], pests attack [3], illegal logging [4] and more generally, to assess the health and structure of forests’ cover [5]. Aircraft platforms provide a better image resolution, returning a higher level of detail compared to satellite, against a higher effort in flight planning and relevant operational costs [6]. UAVs are flexible small platforms characterized by low operational costs, high spatial and temporal resolution [7] but suitable to cover only limited areas. Comparisons among different platforms have been made both in the agricultural [8] and in the forestry field [9].The use of UAV in precision forestry has exponentially increased in recent years, as demonstrated by the large number of papers published between 2018 and 2019; more than 400 references were found when searching for “UAV” + “forest” and considering articles, conference proceedings and books [10].Authors have dealt with several research topics involving applications in forest monitoring, inventorying, and mapping both with multirotor and fixed-wing unmanned platforms equipped with a wide series of optical technology sensors [11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. These studies took into account forestry UAV applications mainly within two forest types: the first one included planted, pure and even-aged forests [19,20,21,22,23,24] and the second one included natural, mixed and uneven-aged forests where the spatial variability of vegetation was very high [25,26,27,28,29].Within natural, mixed and uneven-aged forests research, UAVs have been employed most commonly for (i) estimation of dendrometric parameters such as dominant height, stem number, crown area, volume and above-ground biomass (Wa) using RGB (Red–Green–Blue bands camera) [30,31,32,33,34], multispectral near red green (NRG) [35,36] and laser scanning [37,38] sensors. This is the top research topic because reliable information on the status and trends of forest resources is the basis for the decision-making process for forest management and planning [39]; (ii) tree species classification and invasive plants detection for forest inventories and monitoring of biodiversity using RGB [40,41], multispectral [42,43], hyperspectral [29,44] and laser scanning [45] sensors; (iii) flight plan ad RGB sensor settings to improve imagery products accuracy [26,46,47,48,49] (iv) forest health monitoring and diseases mapping using different sensors (RGB [50], multispectral [51], hyperspectral [52], thermal [15]) to provide data for supporting intervention decisions in the management of forests; (v) recovery monitoring after fire events or conservation interventions through UAV equipped with RGB [53] and multispectral [2,17] cameras.By providing key forest structural attributes such as tree crown centers and boundaries, UAV imagery tree segmentation is used for stem counting [32,54], extrapolation of further dendrometric parameters (i.e., Wa) [55,56,57,58,59], species recognition [42], and pathogens detection and mapping [60].Regarding Wa estimation, there are two main strategies adopted for Digital Aerial Photogrammetry (DAP) and Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS)-based analysis in forestry inventories: (i) the Area-Based Approach (ABA), a distribution-based technique which provides data at stand level using predictive models developed with co-located ground plot measurements and RS data that are then applied to the entire area of interest to generate estimates of specific forest attributes [61]; and (ii) Individual Tree Crown segmentation (ITC) delineation, in which individual tree crowns, heights and positions are the basic units of assessment and where specific algorithms are used to identify the location and size of individual trees from raster images or high-density point clouds [62]. Previous research papers dealt with biomass estimation both at the stand and at tree level. Biomass at stand level is evaluated by comparing the effects of flight settings, sensor type and resolution in tropical woodlands [55], the influence of plot size in dry tropical forests [58] or by taking into account different mangrove species in South China wetlands [59]. Concerning tree-level biomass estimation, Guerra-Hernandez et al. [57] and Guerra-Hernandez et al. [56] used, respectively, UAV-DAP point clouds in open Mediterranean forest of coniferous Pinus pinea (Central of Portugal) and DAP and ALS data in evergreen Eucalyptus spp. plantation (North of Portugal). The latter two studies are important references for modeling SfM individual tree diameters and SfM-derived individual tree biomass (WaSfM) and volume (VSfM) from the canopy height model (CHM) in Mediterranean forest plantation.Segmentation of individual tree crowns is difficult, particularly in broadleaf, mixed, or multi-layered forests. This is generally due to an inability to determine the appropriate kernel size to simultaneously minimize omission and commission error with respect to tree stem identification [63]. In the literature, several unsupervised segmentation approaches have been proposed: the most widely used is the watershed segmentation algorithm [20,23,34,64,65,66,67] and its variants [16,54,68]. Other techniques are multiresolution segmentation algorithm [27,69], large-scale mean-shift algorithm [35], semantic-level segmentation using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [70] and more complex approaches with two or more integrated algorithms [37,63,71]. Some authors associated the above-mentioned unsupervised approaches to manually drawn individual tree crown polygons from on-screen interpretation to compare and validate results or provide a reference for the accuracy assessment of an automatic procedure [72,73,74].Among the papers that adopted both manual and unsupervised tree segmentation, only a few research works included ground data collection [42,72,75,76,77] with a tree sample size ranging from 109 to 2069 trees. None of those presented wood biomass in-field data. For natural, mixed and uneven-aged forest, Mayr et al. [75] gathered tree height in dry savannah and used an implementation of the watershed segmentation algorithm provided by System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses-Geographic Information System (SAGA-GIS) while Franklin and Ahmed [42] utilized the multi-resolution segmentation procedure with the ENVI software system and they collected tree height and crown dimensions in a mixed maple, aspen, and birch forest. Concerning planted, pure and even-aged forests, Ganz et al. [72] used a multiresolution segmentation algorithm and measured tree height within stands of Norway spruce and common beech while Apostol et al. [77] utilized the watershed algorithm and collected tree height and stem diameter in an even-aged Douglas fir stand. By taking tree height as ground-truth data in a chestnut plantation, Marques et al. [76] segmented trees by combining a vegetation-index based algorithm with the Otsu method.Chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) orchards are a type of multifunctional tree cultivation used worldwide that represent a relevant income for rural populations. In Italy, sweet chestnut groves cover 147,568 hectares (ha) of the whole Italian forested territory [78]. Only a few research papers used UAV in chestnut plantations and dealt with phytosanitary problem detection and monitoring of tree health [76,79,80], automatic classification and segmentation of chestnut fruits through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [81], and insects damage rate detection and pest control methods [82]. However, there is no research available that tried to estimate the amounts of residues coming from tree tending by using UAV techniques and comparing their information with ground truth. In the present study, the authors applied RS techniques (UAV) to collect data on uneven-aged and irregularly spaced chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) orchards. The aim of the present study was to verify the reliability of RS techniques for the estimation of pruning wood biomass (Wpw) through differences in the volume of canopy trees calculated with supervised extraction and to evaluate the performance of an unsupervised segmentation methodology as a feasible tool for large-area analysis. In the context of the Circular Economy, a fast and cost-effective tool able to estimate the amounts of residues available as by-products, such as chestnut pruning material, can be included in an alternative and virtuous supply chain.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
760,"The study took place within the Amiata mountain region (Tuscany, Italy) between 2017 and 2018. Four sites located into three different chestnut orchards were selected as representative of this area in terms of variety and management practices (Figure 1).The experimental sites’ characteristics are shown in Table 1. The chestnut orchards under study were uneven-aged and irregularly spaced (Figure 1), mainly due to replacements of dead trees that occurred over time. For this reason, they were equated to irregular forests.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Experimental Sites,2
761,"At the beginning of March 2017, 30 chestnut trees per plot (A, B, C, D) were selected and the diameter at breast height (DBH) was callipered. The choice of the sample trees was made by identifying plants representative of each site in terms of size (DBH). Sample trees were georeferenced at high resolution (0.02 m) with a differential GPS (Leica GS09 GNSS, Leica Geosystems AG). In February 2018, the previously selected trees were pruned, their branches severed and grouped in two sets: “wings” (pieces below 4 cm in diameter) and “wood” (pieces over 4 cm in diameter). The first group had no commercial use while the second could follow two different destinations: sold as firewood after being seasoned in the field or sold to the industry for tannins extraction. These two raw materials were separately loaded on a tractor equipped with a bucket or a pitchfork and weighed by means of portable scales (model WWSD6T, Nonis s.r.l., Biella, Italy). Every five weighing the scales’ accuracy was checked by weighing the tractor unloaded. From every site, Wpw samples were collected and weighed fresh, then oven-dried according to the standard UNI EN ISO 18134-2:2017 to measure their moisture content. The following analyses and comparisons were made on a dry matter basis, avoiding uncontrollable variability due to wood samples size, initial moisture conditions or seasoning.", 2.

762,"Remote sensed data were acquired to characterize the intra-plot variability in terms of plant vigor and Wpw. Two flight campaigns were performed on 2 August 2017 and on 25 July 2018 at the same phenological stage using a modified multi-rotor Mikrokopter (HiSystems GmbH, Moomerland, Germany) described in Matese and Di Gennaro [83] equipped with a multispectral camera Tetracam ADC Snap (Tetracam Inc., Chatsworth, CA, USA). The second flight was performed immediately after the canopy pruning management to enable a comparison between ground truth and UAV results. Multispectral image acquisition was planned flying at 60 m above ground level at midday, yielding a ground resolution of 0.05 m pixel−1 and a 70% overlap in both directions. The images were recorded in clear sky conditions. The radiometric calibration processes were realized by acquiring, during the flight, images from three OptoPolymer (OptoPolymer-Werner Sanftenberg, Munich, Germany) reference panels, with 95%, 50%, and 5% reflectance, respectively.The data processing workflow is described in Figure 2. Multispectral or NRG images with three broad bands (Near-infrared–Red–Green bands) acquired by UAV were processed using Agisoft Metashape Professional Edition 1.5.2 [84], which allows to generate the dense cloud and the orthomosaic of each experimental site. During this process, any ground control points (GCPs) were used due to the irregular and dense canopy cover. The spatial variability in the chestnut orchard was evaluated in terms of vigor and assuming the correspondence between NDVI and vigor [85,86]. NDVI was used as a further filter threshold, as described in Section 2.4.The dense cloud obtained was normalized using a digital elevation model (DEM) from the automatic classification of ground points from photogrammetric software and subsequently imported into QGis software [87] to develop, by means of the LAStools toolbox [88], the CHM relative to the canopy height of each sample tree. The resolution chosen for this model was 0.05 m.The next processing step concerned the creation of a chestnut crown mask through a two-fold approach: supervised and unsupervised segmentation. The supervised method consisted of manually drawing each chestnut crown one by one within the experimental plot, visualizing together the CHM and the NRG orthomosaic in the QGis software. The unsupervised approach used a script called ‘rLIDAR’ (version 0.1.1) [89] in R programming language (version 3.6.0), which allows to generate a vector format file relative to the position and the crown dimension of each sample tree. First, CHM smoothing was performed to eliminate spurious local maxima caused by tree branches. Then, the location and height of individual trees were automatically detected using the CHM and the Local maxima method (rLiDAR: FindTreesCHM function) by sequentially searching the moving window through a Fixed Window Size (FWS) set to 9x9 pixels. In this step, we used a lower CHM resolution (0.25 m/pixel) to generate the mask with the unsupervised method, due to the fact that the workflow with native resolution (0.05 m/pixel) required to many computing resources. However, the segmentation provided enough accuracy with respect to the supervised segmentation. The threshold for the lowest tree height (minht) was fixed at 3.0 m to avoid the misdetection of forest undergrowth as trees. For unsupervised crown segmentation, the ForestCAS function (cf. rLiDAR) based on the watershed method was applied to automatically detect crown boundaries. The threshold for the maximum crown radius (maxcrown) was set to 15.0 m, according to chestnut dendrometric characteristics.Finally, the obtained dataset was analyzed to perform a spatial estimation of the potential pruning biomass (Figure 2). The tree crown volume was calculated at the pixel level by integrating the volume of all the individual pixels that were positioned below each tree. This choice was made to deal with the irregular shape of every tree and consequently, to reduce the error usually produced in empirical estimations due to the inexact assimilation of trees to regular solids. Therefore, as suggested by Torres-Sanchez et al. [90], the height and area of every tree pixel were multiplied to obtain the pixel volume; subsequently, the crown projected volume was derived by adding the volume of all the pixels below each chestnut tree.For identifying the volume change between the two years (before and after pruning), the tree mask generated both in the supervised and unsupervised method for the 2017 dataset was chosen as the reference and also used in 2018 (QGis Software) to correct the XY shift of the camera GPS between the two flights. This operation avoided an overestimation of the segmented crown area in 2018 following pruning, especially with R software. The Wpw estimation was performed on the basis of the crown volume reduction in the post-pruning survey with respect to the first flight. A linear regression model between the Wpw measured on the ground and estimated by UAV was applied to evaluate the performance of the UAV approach.Since the aim of this work was Wpw estimation from remote sensing data, for ground truth measurements, we focused on a very large number of pruning wood sampling (30 trees/site), while only the DBH parameter was meausured as geometric field data for sample trees selection. As a consequence, the geometric data evaluation was related only to the comparison between the supervised and unsupervised methods on the structure from the motion dataset, without any field data as ground truth (tree height or crown dimension).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. UAV Platform and Data Processing,2
763,"Several authors reported on the improvement in tree crown segmentation when vegetation indices analysis is applied in discriminating between vegetation targets [76,90]. However, in our study, the discrimination between canopy and no canopy pixels was ensured by the CHM thanks to the higher tree height which was more than double the regular plantation sites observed in other works [76,90]. Although the spectral data were not used to improve the segmentation of the crowns from the soil, in our study, they were used to improve the measurement of volume reduction from the CHM.In detail, the elaboration of crown volume data from the pruned tree (2018 survey) accounted also for no canopy information of the small holes within the canopy undetected by the 3D reconstruction process performed with Agisoft Metashape but clearly visible in the orthomosaic. To solve these problems, we applied a double filtering process: the first one based on canopy height (CHM) and the second based on a vegetation index (NDVI) threshold to remove no vegetation pixels within the crown (Figure 3). The results presented in this work were obtained from a dataset filtered with an NDVI threshold of 0.3.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Double Filtering Approach,2
764,"Reference segmentation masks of sample trees were manually created for each experimental site. The supervised method was applied to develop a linear model between ground truth Wpw and crown projected volume reduction extracted by the reference segmentation mask. The linear model was then applied to calculate the estimated Wpw from the unsupervised segmentation method following Equation (1):

Y = β (X1 − X2) + γ


(1)


where Y is the dependent variable (Wpw), X1 to X2 are independent variables related, respectively, to crown-projected volume before and after pruning management, β is the multiplicative parameter and γ is the intercept. The coefficient of determination (R2) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were computed between the measured correlations, between supervised and unsupervised segmentation approaches for UAV geometric data extraction, and between ground-truth measured and estimated Wpw data.The adjusted coefficient of determination (Equation (2)), the relative root mean square error (Equation (3)) and the percentage bias (Equation (4)) to determine the accuracy of unsupervised segmentation for estimating Wpw using crown projected volume reduction are as follows:

adjR2 = 1 − ((n − 1)∑(yini = 1 − ŷi)2(n − p)∑(yini = 1 − yi)2)


(2)



rRMSE = RMSEy


(3)



PBias = 100*(∑(ŷi − yini = 1)n)

where n is the number of trees, yi is the field measured Wpw i, y is the the mean observed value of Wpw and ŷi is the estimated value of Wpw derived from the linear regression model. A statistical analysis was performed using R software.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Puning Wood Biomass Estimation,2
765,"In Table 2 are presented the ground data of measured Wpw per tree, per site (sample of 30 trees) and per surface unit.The yield of Wpw per hectare was comparable with the data presented in a former study [91], where three chestnut groves produced from 22 up to 33 Mg ha−1, but this result matches only with site A. In fact, although site A was different from the other three sites presented in the aforementioned study, showing an even bigger DBH on average compared to them, it had a similar pruning intensity. Compared to site A, the number of pruning residues produced in the other three sites investigated in the present study turned out to be noticeably lower, probably caused here—as in other case studies—by differences in trees age, site density, and pruning intensity. The results of sites C and D were very similar and still comparable to site B in terms of wood biomass recovered after pruning, despite the different chestnut varieties.The proportion of “wood” compared to “wings” was equal to 311.9% at site A, 55.7% at site B and 51.7% at site D. At site C, it was not possible to separate the two fractions due to operative reasons.", 3. Results, 3.1. Wpw Ground Measurement,3
766,"Table 3 shows the geometric characterization of each experimental site arising from supervised segmentation before (2017) and after pruning (2018). Maximum tree height, crown mean height, crown area, and crown projected volume are mean values of each site. Crown area and crown projected volume per site are also showed to provide a general overview of biomass reduction after pruning. These values derive from a single tree crown area and projected crown volume, respectively, multiplied by the total number of trees for each site.The decrease in heights after pruning is not significantly different. However, considering crown mean height and crown area, biomass reduction between the two years detected by UAV is relevant. In fact, it ranges from 8.8% in site A to 14.2% in site B, referring to the crown mean height and from 6.5% in site B to 15.1% in site A, considering the crown area values. In sites C and D, these two parameters show intermediate but comparable variations, reflecting the geomorphological and vegetational similarities of the two sites, in detail: crown mean heights of 11.0% (C) and 11.6% (D), and crown areas of 13.1% (C) and 11.8% (D).The tree geometric characteristic that best shows the effects of pruning is crown projected volume, whose values have the strongest variations between 2017 and 2018. The highest percentage of biomass reduction was found at site C (21.4%) while site A has the maximum decrease (298 m3), confirming ground measurements (see Table 2).", 3. Results, 3.2. Supervised Data Extraction,3
767,"Table 4 reports the segmentation results of the proposed unsupervised methodology. Following Marques et al. [76]’s study, the evaluation of the automatic segmentation accuracy applied in this work was assessed by comparing it with a manual crowns’ segmentation. In line with the different site conditions in terms of trees age and dimension, the proposed methodology provides a different response in terms of accuracy. Site A presented the lowest accuracy value (46.7%) due to the highest presence of both over and under detection cases. In detail, the irregular and oversize crown (mean values over 90 m2) caused elevated crown shape fragmentation (33.3%), while the high overlap crown level led to 20.0% of merged cases. Sites B and D, characterized by a lower overlap level, showed the best accuracy performances, respectively 83.3% and 76.7%. Site D presented a lower accuracy value due to the 20.0% of merged crowns in a circumscribed zone with close trees with similar crown heights. An intermediate accuracy performance was found in the C site (63.3%), where the lowest values and variability in terms of height and some irregular shape cases caused an overestimation of 26.7% crown shape segmentation. The methodology provided the optimal results in terms of undetected tree crown, with 1.7% mean accuracy considering the overall dataset (four sites).", 3. Results, 3.3. Unsupervised Data Extraction,3
768,"Figure 4 presents the comparison results between supervised and unsupervised segmentation approaches to perform tree geometric characterization from the structure of motion products. Taking into account the presence of split and merged cases in the unsupervised approach, the dataset was first analyzed not tree-by-tree but by means of the aggregation per site of each polygon identified by both segmentation methodologies. Each XY graph shows the comparison of geometric data related to four sites in both years (2017–2018). The height estimation both for tree height and crown mean height was correctly described from the proposed unsupervised method, providing R2 = 1.00 correlation coefficient and a good accuracy in terms of values RMSE = 0.25 m and RMSE = 0.24 m, respectively. Considering the estimation of the crown area mean value per site, no correlation was found from the application of the proposed methods (R2 = 0.01), with a high difference between the values (RMSE = 21.47 m2). The crown-projected volume shows a lower correlation (R2 = 0.54) than pure height-derived variables (tree height and crown mean height), but a discrete error in the absolute values (RMSE = 274.64 m3). Regarding full site characterization in terms of canopy cover area and crown projected volume, the unsupervised method provided very high correlations: R2 = 0.93 and R2 = 0.99, respectively.A deep analysis was performed taking into account a larger dataset obtained by the unsupervised segmentation to evaluate the performance of the proposed method as a feasible tool for Wpw evaluation on large scale areas. The unsupervised dataset was created with about 67.5% matched polygons, potentially available to investigate correlation tree-to-tree with measured ground truth Wpw and supervised geometric data per tree. The dataset was then increased by adding the 16.7% of split cases considered as single-tree data by the merging of the sub-polygons in which a sample tree was fragmented by the unsupervised approach. Figure 5 reports the correlations (R2 and RSME) related to crown volume reduction of the proposed methodology versus the manually segmented mask.The unsupervised method showed a high accuracy performance in crown segmentation, providing high R2 values ranging between 0.76 and 0.95, and good precision in term of absolute values, with RMSE ranging between 79.16 m3 and 117.48 m3. The scatterplots show results close to the 1:1 line between supervised and unsupervised segmentation methods.", 3. Results, 3.4. Geometric Data Comparison between the Supervised and the Unsupervised Approach,3
769,"Table 5 presents the correlation results (equations and R2) between crown projected volume reduction (X-independent variable) and pruning wood biomass (Y-dependent variable), in which a linear regression model was applied to the dataset extracted with the manually reference masks and the ground truth Wpw measurements. All sites show representative results with higher correlation coefficients for the A site (R2 = 0.78), intermediate value in site C and D (R2 = 0.71 and R2 = 0.69 respectively) and lower in site B (R2 = 0.60). Considering the similar tree ages and dimensions in the close sites C and D, Table 5 also reports the good correlations obtained by oganising the two sites as a single dataset (R2 = 0.65). The linear regression analysis applied to the overall dataset provides good results but lower than the values at the single-site level (R2 = 0.33).Concerning the Wpw validation, the estimated Wpw values obtained using the calibration realized in each site with the manually segmented mask were compared with ground-truth Wpw measurements. Figure 6 shows the linear regression results within every single site and with the aggregated dataset (C + D and all dataset), which are similar to the trend found in Table 5.Table 6 reports the statistic results of the methodology suggested as Wpw estimation approach. Site A presents a higher accuracy in Wpw estimation (R2 = 0.83) but RMSE = 221.26 kg is very high, while site B presents lower correlations (R2 = 0.53 and RMSE = 46.99). Sites C and D show good correlations with R2 = 0.54 and R2 = 0.67 respectively, and similar values in terms of RMSE 47.38 kg and 43.08 kg, respectively. Combining the C and D datasets, the results obtained show similar behavior to the separate dataset analysis (with R2 = 0.61 and RMSE = 45.28 kg). The correlations identified using the overall dataset present a lower correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.49) than the other sites, but similar to sites B and C. As reported in Table 6, the unsupervised methodology provides rRMSE values between 44.10% (site A) and 71.60% (site B), and presents very low PBias values with a minimal tendency of understimation in sites B, C, D (mean value −3.0%). Site A presents an overestimation tendency with a bias value of 12.60%.", 3. Results, 3.5. Wpw Estimation,3
770,"This work aimed to evaluate the accuracy performance of supervised and unsupervised methodologies to estimate pruned biomass. To carry out this objective, an experimental design was planned by taking into account four sites with different conditions of vegetative growth in terms of DBH dimension, trees density and height. Site A presented the highest vegetative growth conditions, site B an intermediate level, C and D, the lowest dimensions. Those different vegetative conditions directly affected the geometric estimation provided by the UAV data analysis, so it was necessary to divide the dataset into three different groups of trees according to age and therefore, size.Pruning intensity varied among sites as the tender’s choice normally depends on the trees’ growth, health conditions and age. The heavier intervention carried out with restoration purposes, as in site A, corresponded to a higher wood production, in line with analogous cases. In orchards where pruning is conducted on a long timespan (8–10 years) the amount of wood residues available for industrial purposes can be relevant (from 51.7% to 311.9% in the present study) and an early survey can provide useful information for planning the supply.The results show that UAV monitoring has a good performance in detecting the biomass reduction after pruning, despite the differences between the trees’ geometric characteristics mentioned in Section 3.1. The tree height decrease was weakly detected, mainly due to some branches not being pruned in 2017, which therefore attenuated the height reduction with their vigorous growth in 2018. Considering crown mean height and crown area, the biomass decrease is evident because they are more representative features of the whole canopy. By analyzing the data shown in Table 3, it can be stated that the crown projected volume is the best tree geometric characteristic with which biomass variation can be monitored. In site C, the highest volume decrease is not associated with the greatest height decrease and this can be explained by the typical chestnut pruning method. This technique is not characterized by a uniform topping and hedging but by the cutting of whole branches, so there is no marked height reduction. This led to the formation of crown holes whose presence can be clearly detected only by analyzing tree volume.In the present work, the chestnut orchard condition strongly affected the segmentation accuracy. The high variability due to irregular spacing between trees, ages and dimensions, irregular crown shape, absence of isolated tree cases, high overlap crown conditions and minimal presence of free space around each tree crown caused a lower accuracy performance in tree segmentation with respect to elevated tree detection results described in other valuable works such as those suggested by Marques et al. [76] and Jorge Torres-Sánchez et al. [90]. The large number of oversized tree crowns in the site A led to an increase in the percentage of split and merged cases, while in sites C and D, the lowest values of DBH and trees’ height affect the segmentation accuracy providing 26.7% of split and 20% of merged cases respectively. Concerning the feasibility of large areas canopy cover scouting, the method proposed provided similar results as those reported by Marques et al. [76] related to an undetected tree percentage value (1.7%).The evaluation of the accuracy of the unsupervised method applied in this study was realized by the comparison of a geometric dataset for each site in each year with the data extracted with the reference mask manually drawn. The proposed method provides a correct estimation of the mean height per tree in terms of tree height with minimal difference in absolute values (RMSE = 0.25 m), confirming the good performance as a height estimation tool for that type of survey on large areas. The mean crown area per tree within each site presents poor correlations and a high RMSE value, as a consequence of the wide value range derived from the split and merge cases of the unsupervised segmentation polygons. The crown projected volume shows a better performance in terms of correlations than the crown area due to the positive influence of the well estimated height but still with a high RMSE value. The analysis of the total canopy cover and the total crown projected volume per site provides optimal results, confirming the method as a powerful tool for fast detection in large areas. A focus elaboration on the projected crown volume reduction between the two years as a consequence of the pruning management practice was performed by increasing the dataset of the matched crowns with the sum of the sub-polygons in which some crowns were divided, reported as “split cases”. The improved dataset shows the highest correlation coefficients (mean R2 = 0.86) and a low difference in values (mean RMSE = 99.75 m3) with respect to manually segmented crowns.The validation of the method was carried out after a calibration step, a model was created using a regression analysis between Wpw and volume variation extracted with the reference mask manually drawn on the crown profile. Subsequently, the model identified was applied to the segmentation results obtained with the proposed method. The estimated Wpw per crown was finally correlated with the measured Wpw in order to define the accuracy in terms of correlation coefficient and RMSE. In the case of a full dataset analysis, the approach obtained good correlation (R2 = 0.33 for calibration and R2 = 0.49 for validation) but the clustered nature of the dataset with different tree conditions implied a lower performance, confirming the application of a site-by-site approach as the most correct choice. The method proposed showed the high coefficient of correlation (R2 = 0.83) for site A, but with a very high RMSE since this site was extremely modified in terms of Wpw removed more than the others. Despite showing a lower accuracy in Wpw estimation (R2 = 0.53), site B presented an acceptable RMSE = 46.99 kg. The factors that strongly reduced the segmentation success were the higher tree density within the site and an elevated overlap level between adjacent crowns, as reported in Table 3. In fact, this site is characterized by high tree and DBH values (close to the biggest in site A), but the lowest mean crown area with respect to all other sites. The application of the proposed methods in sites C and D characterized by similar tree conditions provided high and concordant performances, suggesting that they should be considered as a single dataset (R2 = 0.61). This result strongly encourages the hypothesis of the feasibility of this method as a site-specific tool for large-scale monitoring. The PBias indicates an overall tendency of minimal understimation, while in site A, characterized by very different conditions in term of Wpw harvested and tree ages, the unsupervised segmentation approach shows a low overstimation of the Wpw with respect to ground truth meausurements.In the literature, there are no studies regarding chestnut Wpw estimation using UAV. Nevertheless, there have already been recent studies that specifically derived individual biomass and VSfM at tree level with ITC segmentation. Among these, important references in the Mediterranean environment were represented mainly by Guerra-Hernandez et al. [57] and Guerra-Hernandez et al. [56], who used a fixed-wing UAV equipped with an RGB camera to evaluate (i) WaSfM in Pinus pinea regular forest plantation (10 x 16 m regular spaced, open canopy, fairly flat terrain, no understory) and (ii) VSfM in Eucalyptus regular forest plantation (3.7 × 2.5 m regularly spaced, steep terrain). Comparing our results with the aforementioned studies, it worth noting that the RMSE could only be compared with Guerra-Hernandez et al. [57], who used the same unit (kg) and reported a value of 87.46 and 117.80 kg for 2015 and 2017, respectively. These values are lower than the overall aggregated dataset RMSE (217.54 kg, Table 6) and the difference could be partially explained by the regular characteristics of the stand investigated by the reference study (spacing, tree age, field management). Thereafter, it is of pivotal importance to compare different remote sensed tree biomasses through statistic indexes that facilitate comparison between datasets or models with different scales, as rRMSE and adjR2. Guerra-Hernandez et al. [57] in P. pinea plantation gained good results in the estimation of WaSfM in comparison to measured Wa (0.85 < adjR2 < 0.87 and 11.44% < rRMSE < 12.59% in two different years and model approaches) while Guerra-Hernandez et al. [56], in a Eucalyptus plantation, got slightly worse performances (R2 = 0.43 and rRMSE = 20.31%). However, the current work presents lower correlation values (except in one case) and lower rRMSE (Table 6) with respect to the literature references, mainly due to orchard characteristics (uneven-aged and irregularly spaced) and fine pruning evaluation purposes with respect to growth monitoring. As for Guerra-Hernandez et al. [57], who focused on canopy management study in fruit production crop, our method falls within precision agriculture applications while most of the literature focused on precision forestry.A strong point of this method was that the dataset was acquired with a low-resolution multispectral camera, which provides both geometric information from the CHM reconstruction and spectral data to calculate the NDVI layer used as a filtering approach to improve the quality of the dataset. As a consequence, the weight of the products to be processed were much lower, allowing faster data processing and requiring less computing power.", 4. Discussion,None,4
771,"In the context of the Circular Economy envisaged as a “regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimized by slowing, closing and narrowing material and energy loops” [92], it is important to estimate the amounts of wastes available as by-products for industrial purposes. In this specific case, chestnut pruning and their periodical availability can be forecasted and included in supply chain planning to benefit both producers and industrial users.The unsupervised segmentation method proposed in this work made it possible to realize an accurate estimation of chestnut geometric characteristics from high-resolution CHM layers in four study sites. The results obtained are strongly in line with those extracted with a reference manually segmented mask. Applying a calibration performed on supervised UAV data extraction, the method reports a high accuracy in terms of R2 and RMSE values, suggesting this approach as a fast and cost-effective tool for fast monitoring of large areas. The dataset was acquired before and after a pruning management practice in four study sites identifying three different DBH classes (around ~0.50 m, ~0.60 m, ~0.80 m). The results obtained allow for us to conclude that the method provides generally good performance, but to achieve the best Wpw estimation, is necessary to choose the correct calibration curve in the function of the DBH. This input information could be easily provided by the orchard owner, making the proposed method a useful tool for fast Wpw estimation purposes.A future perspective could be to evaluate the potential of a combined approach analyzing also the spectral data actually used only to improve data extraction accuracy, with the aim of finding the described Wpw estimation performance by the contribution of information on vegetation indices.", 5. Conclusion,None,5
772,"Plants require nitrogen (N) nutrition for many important compounds, such as amino and nucleic acids [1,2]. Over a wide range, plant growth is linearly dependent on N supply [3]. Above that range, higher rates of fertilization do not necessarily improve yield and can cause serious water pollution [4]. Additionally, leaf nitrogen concentration (LNC) is associated with the photosynthetic capacity of leaves and thus allows global-scale CO2 assimilation to be modelled based on specific leaf area and LNC [5,6]. There is a need for the N condition of plants to be determined efficiently and accurately for fertilization guidance and for understanding carbon and N cycles.Traditional hand-held or chemically-determined LNC can be accurate but destructive or unrealistic for large-area needs. Meanwhile, various remote sensing techniques have been proposed as convenient and precise methods for detecting the physiological condition of plants [7,8]. The visible and red-edge region has been recognized as an important indicator of chlorophyll and N [9,10,11]. Apart from the traditional passive (using sunlight as the light source) reflectance acquired by spectrometers, laser intensity can also reflect the target’s properties in an active (light source is provided by the sensor) way. Both techniques have their respective advantages and disadvantages. Passive spectrometers often cover a wide spectral range with high spectral resolution. However, they tend to be influenced by environmental factors, such as weather and sunlight conditions, and have a large field of view (FOV > 50 cm2), depending at the range to target. By contrast, multispectral LiDAR (MSL) and hyperspectral LiDAR (HSL) strengthen the spectral detecting abilities of traditional single-wavelength LiDAR and simultaneously provide three-dimensional information and spectral properties. However, they are often limited to a few to dozens of channels [12,13,14,15]. The laser-induced fluorescence technology is also promising in detecting the biochemical conditions of plants [16].Both passive and active reflectance spectra have been successfully applied in estimating the LNC of rice [17,18], which is an important crop. However, the regression result can be strongly influenced by the adopted machine learning algorithm [19,20]. Moreover, no algorithm presents a universally good performance, and the “best” regression method varies with the characteristics of the problem and the data set provided. Though deep learning has demonstrated outstanding abilities in studying internal data mechanisms [21,22], its demand for training data volume and computation hardware is high. Training samples can be expensive, especially for remote sensing applications. The aim of this study is to investigate the performance of six popular machine learning algorithms in the context of detecting rice LNC with passive and active spectral data (i.e., ASD FieldSpec Pro FR (Analytical Spectral Devices, field spectroradiometer, full-range, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA), MSL, and HSL) and provide reference to find a comparatively “universal” regression algorithm for similar applications. This study also endeavors to offer guidance for choosing classification and regression algorithms for the development MSL/HSL systems. As the exact relationship between LNC and leaf reflectance remains unclear, both linear and nonlinear regression models were applied in this study, including partial least-square regression (PLSR), least squares boosting (LSBoost), bagging (Bag), random forest (RF), back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and support vector regression (SVR) of different types/kernels/parameter values. The R2, root mean square error (RMSE) and relative error (RE) in rice LNC estimation using these different methods were compared, using the passive and active measurements of rice of different varieties and at different locations and time, namely, Yongyou 4949 in Suizhou, 2014, and Yangliangyou 6 in Wuhan, 2015.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
773,"Yongyou 4949 and Yangliangyou 6 were the rice cultivars used in this study. They were cultivated at Junchuan County, Suizhou, and the experimental area of Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, in 2014 and 2015, respectively (Figure 1). These two areas lie in Hubei Province (108°21′42′′–116°07′50′′E, 29°01′53′′–33°6′47′′N), in the center of China. The climate of this area is subtropical monsoon humid, which is suitable for the growth of paddy rice.For obtaining rice samples with a variety of LNCs, different levels of urea fertilizer treatments were applied in separate fields while controlling other cultivation conditions identically. In 2014, the crops were seeded on 27 April and transplanted on 1 June. Altogether six levels of urea fertilizer (0, 189, 229.5, 270, 310.5, and 351 kg/ha) were implemented, with 30% at seeding, 20% at tillering, 25% at shooting, and 25% at booting stage. In 2015, the crops were seeded on 30 April, and transplanted on 27 May. Four levels of urea fertilizer (0, 120, 180, 240 kg/ha) were implemented, with 60% at seeding, 20% at tillering and 20% at shooting. Three replicate fields were utilized for every urea fertilizer level. In each plot, at least six fully expanded second leaves from the top were selected randomly, obtaining a total of 220 leaves. The fresh leaf samples were sealed in plastic bags, kept in ice chests, and then transported to the laboratory. The LNC of the rice samples were determined through the Kjeldahl method [23] at the Wuhan Academy of Agricultural Science and Technology.", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.1. Study Sites Description,2
774,"The ASD FieldSpec Pro FR (Analytical Spectral Devices, Inc., Boulder, CO, USA) is a popular detector that can measure reflectance spectra from 400 to 2500 nm with a resampled 1 nm resolution. It has been widely utilized in remote sensing because of its convenience as a field spectrometer and high spectral resolution [24,25]. A strong correlation between foliar N and chlorophyll has been found in various plant species using different spectral indices [26,27,28]. The sensitivity of various biochemical parameters to spectra according to the PROSPECT model shows that chlorophyll content and leaf structure index prevail from 400 to 1000 nm [29]. Thus, the 400 to 1000 nm range was chosen for the ASD data in the analysis.The two active sensors investigated were the MSL and the HSL system. The MSL system emits and detects light at four wavelengths: 556, 670, 700, and 780 nm. The HSL system has a white continuum light source and 32 channels that receive light from 538 to 910 nm, with a spectral resolution of 12 nm. Both systems were developed by Wuhan University and are laboratory-based prototypes. Further detailed description of the two systems are referred to in the works of Wei et al. [30] and Du et al. [31]. The spectral characteristics of rice samples were acquired by MSL, ASD, and HSL. For each leaf, three positions were randomly selected, and the average reflectance was later seen as a proxy for the reflectance of the whole leaf. A reference panel (Spectralon, Labsphere, Inc., North Sutton, NH, USA, reflectance nearly 99%) was measured before and after the spectral measurements by the three sensors in the laboratory under the same lighting conditions as the detected rice samples (lighted by a halogenated lamp of 50 W in the case of ASD and then by the MSL and HSL system respectively).The return intensity of the reflected light must be calibrated against the measurements of a standard white reference panel. The reflectance at each wavelength can be obtained by dividing the raw return intensity value of the target by the averaged value of the reference panel. Thus, some systematic and random errors can be eliminated. The Savitzky–Golay smoothing filter [32] with a third-order polynomial function and a bandwidth of 25 nm was applied to the ASD data within the range of 400–1000 nm.", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.2. Passive and Active Spectra Measurement,2
775,"Principal Component Analysis: The ASD provides spectral data with hundreds of wavebands that provide high dimensionality that is often much higher than the number of available training samples. Additionally, significant redundancy is observed in high-dimensional spectral information. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a useful tool for reducing the correlation among high-dimensional data and can produce several principal components (PCs) that contain nearly as much information as the whole dataset [33]. Considering the noise and the redundancy of information from many wavelengths, the accuracy with hyperspectral data is not necessarily higher than that with the first few PCs. In the process of reducing the dimensionality of ASD spectra, the eigen vectors and eigen values of the covariance matrix composed of multi-dimensional data were first calculated. The data vectors were mapped from the original space to a new orthogonal space using the PCs corresponding to the first few eigen values. In this study, the first three PCs and the hyperspectral data collected by ASD were used as the regression model input (explaining > 99% variance). PCA transformation was not performed on the active spectra because the spectral dimensions of MSL and HSL were not as large as the samples.Partial least-square regression: As a popular linear model, PLSR has been applied in a wide range of fields, including remote sensing. PLSR is a good alternative to many traditional multiple linear regression and PC regression methods because of its robustness [34]. Similar to PCs regression, a PLSR model tries to find the multidimensional direction in the independent space that explains the maximum multidimensional variance direction in the dependent space (y) in an iterative manner [35]. The final model that predicts the p dependent variables y (in this case, p equals 1, LNC) has the following form:

 are the standardalized PCs calculated on mean-centered variables.Least squares boosting and Bagging: The exact relationship between LNC and reflectance spectra remains unclear, and is possibly nonlinear. With this consideration, more nonlinear regression algorithms were employed in this study.LSBoost was developed by Friedman [36] based on the squared loss function. It is a kind of boosting regression method. Boosting creates an ensemble of models that collectively make a prediction to improve performance in the case of the rice LNC. The ensemble is composed of base learners. Each base learner minimizes the residual error of the previous one iteratively with weighted samples. The LSBoost algorithm was chosen because it has a solid mathematical foundation compared with other boosting algorithms. LSBoost begins with an initial guess f_0 and then fits a sequence of M weighted models of T_1 to T_M (decision tree as the base learners in this study) [37]. The final model has the following form:

 denotes the weight for base learner m and v denotes the learning rate. The final output is the weighted average output of all the base learners.Both boosting and bagging [38] build a set of base learners that are combined by voting. Bagging builds a set of base learners by generating replicated bootstrap data, and boosting does so by adjusting the weights of training samples [39]. Bagging and boosting have several differences. First, the training samples of bagging are selected randomly and independently, whereas those of boosting are related to the result of the previous learning. Second, each of the base learners in boosting has its respective weight, whereas in bagging the weights are equal. Third, the base learners of bagging can be generated in a parallel manner, instead of sequentially as that in boosting.In this study, the LSBoost and Bag regressions were executed with the “fitensemble” function in MATLAB R2015b (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), for fitted ensemble for regression. Decision trees were used as the individual models that form the ensemble, as is often adopted [37]. Decision trees select important input dimensions in its calibration process. Different numbers of regression trees were investigated to establish the LSBoost and Bag regression models. Each setting was repeated 50 times, and the average was taken for model performance assessment.Random forest: Proposed by Breiman [40], RF added an additional layer of randomness to bagging. In addition to constructing each tree using a different bootstrap sample of the data, RF changes how regression trees are constructed. In standard trees, each node is split using the best split among all variables. In contrast, each node in RF is split using the best among a subset of randomly selected predictors at that node [41]. This strategy improves the model’s generalization performance and its training efficiency. RF has three parameters: the number of regression trees, the number of predictors to select randomly for each decision split, and the number of predictor splits summed over all trees [42]. The defaults of the latter two parameters in the routines were accepted in the analysis, and the number of trees was tested. Each setting was repeated 50 times, and the average was calculated for model performance assessment.Back-propagation neural network: As a kind of feedforward network, BPNN has been widely applied in solving various nonlinear problems [43,44]. It has the advantage of self-learning and self-adaption with generally good performance [45]. BPNN was applied in this study to model rice LNC and reflectance. BPNN is based on the strategy of gradient descent and adjusts the parameters toward the negative gradient direction.A neural network consists of two or more layers, each with a number of neurons. Each hidden and output neuron in BPNN processes its inputs by multiplying each by the respective weight, summing the product, and passing the sum through a nonlinear transfer function for the final result. The weights of the neurons are modified in response to the errors between the actual and target output values. Training is performed by repeatedly updating the weights at the end of each cycle until the average sum squared error over all the training samples are minimized and within the tolerance specified [46]. More details can be referred to in [47,48]. The regression performance was investigated with different training functions and hidden layer sizes. Each setting was repeated 50 times and the average was obtained for model performance assessment.Support vector regression: SVR can construct both linear and nonlinear regressions using different kernels. Different from an artificial neural network (ANN), SVR has an excellent generalization performance with a strong theoretical foundation in statistical learning theory [49]. SVR is insensitive to the dimension number of training samples and requires a small number of training samples [50]. SVR fits linear regression in the high-dimension feature space and attempts to reduce model complexity by minimizing the empirical risk. SVR has two types: ε-SVR and v-SVR. ε-SVR estimates an unknown continuous-valued function based on a finite set of noisy samples [51]. The optimization problem of SVR has the following form:

In SVR, four kinds of kernels can be chosen: linear, polynomial, RBF, and sigmoid. The latter three kernels establish nonlinear relationships. In this work, all data preprocessing, regression, and evaluation was executed in MATLAB R2015b (Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA, USA), where many regression toolbox and LIBSVM [53] are available. The type of transfer function/kernel function and the associated parameters have to be determined in advance for BPNN and SVR. Thus, the optimization process using different kernels or transfer functions and main parameter with varying values were presented, while other parameters were settled through five-fold cross validation and are not presented below.", 2.

776,"A total of 220 rice samples were collected in 2014 and 2015. They were divided randomly into two datasets: 80% (176) as the training dataset and the remaining 20% (44) as the validation dataset for predicting LNC. The coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and relative error (RE) were calculated as follows to evaluate the performance of the estimation models:

777,"ASD acquires the reflected signals of the targets in a wide range with high spectral resolution. Figure 2 shows that the first three PCs of ASD reflectance contained most of the spectral characteristics. Among them, PC1 was dominated by the red-edge (around 700 nm) and the near-infrared region, with a small slope in the green light domain around 530 nm. PC2 and PC3 contained several complementary spectral features to PC1. PC2 is generally significant in the visible region, covering the absorption spectrum of chlorophylls and carotenoids [54]. PC3 represents the derivative of the reflectance spectra. The first three PCs extracted the most important information in the reflectance spectra (cumulative variance > 99%). In the regression process, both hyperspectral data and PC1–3 were applied in every regression algorithm except for PLSR, because the process of extracting the PCs was originally incorporated in the method. The results showed that for every investigated algorithm except for LSBoost and SVR, the first three PCs showed a stronger correlation with foliar N than the hyperspectral data. This is because LSBoost and SVR have an advantage in dealing with high-dimensional data [50,55]. Hence, the results using the ASD hyperspectral data instead of PCs for these two algorithms are shown in Section 3.3.", 3. Results, 3.1. Principal Components Analysis of ASD Spectra,3
778,"PLSR and SVR with a linear kernel are the two linear regression algorithms investigated in this study. In the optimization process, when the contribution of factors in PLSR was above 90%, the influence of this parameter on the result was marginal. For SVR regression, v-SVR showed a superior ability to ε-SVR, regardless of the spectra used (Figure 3).Figure 3 shows the performance of PLSR with different factor contributions, and ε-SVR and v-SVR with a linear kernel. Figure 4 is scatters of observed and predicted rice LNC using the two linear algorithms with optimal parameters. Figure 3 and Figure 4 show that the MSL data showed a weak correlation with foliar N using PLSR (R2 = 0.17, RMSE = 5.08). Linear regression is not enough to characterize the relationship between rice LNC and MSL, which has only four wavelengths. This was confirmed by the results of SVR with a linear kernel. Meanwhile, the relationships of ASD and HSL with LNC were stronger than that of MSL. Our results also show that the estimation precision of LNC based on ASD was comparable with that of HSL using SVR with a linear kernel (R2 = 0.62, 0.66, RMSE = 3.56, 3.46, respectively).", 3. Results, 3.2. Linear Regression Algorithms,3
779,"Figure 5 shows the process of parameter, transfer function, and kernel optimization using different nonlinear algorithms (LSBoost, Bag, RF, BPNN, and SVR). Optimization process of algorithms of least squares boosting (LSBoost), bagging (Bag), random forest (RF), and SVR using R2 as a measure (ASD, MSL, and HSL). Other parameters were settled through 5-fold validation.As an ensemble learning algorithm, LSBoost uses several base learners (decision tree in this case) to improve the performance of weak learners. HSL requires comparatively fewer decision trees to provide a stable estimation of rice LNC, whereas 170 trees are optimally required by MSL and ASD. Above this threshold, more decision trees did not provide a more accurate LNC estimation. Using the LSBoost algorithm, passive and active spectra showed a stronger relationship to LNC than PLSR and SVR with a linear kernel. Hence, this initially suggests that the relationship between spectral data and foliar N is nonlinear rather than linear.Fewer base learners were required for Bag and RF to provide a satisfactory LNC estimation than the order of magnitude in LSBoost. Moreover, the fold lines of R2 with different base learner numbers were rather flat. The results show that the relationship for reflectance spectra and foliar N using Bag was comparable with that using RF.BPNN has 13 different varieties of transfer functions: trainbfg, trainbr, traincgb, traincgf, traincgp, traingd, traingda, traingdm, traingdx, trainlm, trainoss, trainrp, and trainscg. Until now, no settled criterion for selecting a transfer function exists because the choice should be based on specific circumstances. The performance of different transfer functions deviated greatly with the use of the spectral data from different sensors (Figure 5). However, transfer functions traingd and traingdm produced the worst LNC estimation for the reflectance spectra from every detector, with a lower R2 than any other transfer function (R2 < 0.5). Except for these two transfer functions, the performance of the different transfer functions was similar for ASD regardless of the number of hidden layers. The circumstance for HSL data was similar, except for trainlm, whose performance degraded with the increase of hidden layers. The transfer functions with the highest prediction accuracies were trainlm, traingdx, and traincgp for MSL, ASD, and HSL, respectively.Similar to the transfer function of BPNN, the type and kernel of SVR must be settled through investigation. Figure 3 and Figure 5 show that for kernel linear and RBF, the performance of v-SVR was generally better than ε-SVR. This result confirms the applicability of v-SVR, as reported in a previous study [56]. For the polynomial kernel, their respective R2 values were similar. Our results show that v-SVR with kernel RBF provided the strongest relationship for spectra to paddy rice LNC regardless of the detectors. The influence of different kernels was weak on HSL, stronger on ASD, and strongest on MSL. This result is similar to that of Yao et al. [57], who found that SVR and ANN outperformed PLSR in monitoring wheat LNC.Table 1 shows the regression assessment of the six algorithms with the optimal parameter/transfer function/kernel in terms of the three sensors. In the context of R2, the best estimations of LNC using the spectra from MSL, ASD, and HSL were obtained with SVR, BPNN, and RF, respectively. On the other hand, LNC can be estimated with the lowest RMSE/RE using the spectra from MSL, ASD, and HSL with SVR, SVR, and BPNN, respectively. In summary, BPNN exhibited significant abilities in building the relationship between passive and active reflectance spectra and rice LNC.", 3. Results, 3.3. Nonlinear Regression Algorithms,3
780,"The in vivo specific absorption coefficient of N is hard to get, meaning that LNC can only be detected in an indirect way. Considering the close relations between leaf chlorophylls and N concentration, LNC can be detected through the reflective characteristics of chlorophylls in visible and NIR regions in leaf reflectance [58,59]. Thus, by using machine learning algorithms to study the relationship between leaf spectra and LNC, ideally, the scatter points of predicted versus observed LNC would fall along the 1:1 line. However, apart from chlorophylls, a small portion of N also resides in material such as protein, nucleic acid, and auxin etc. [3]. Systematic and random noise have an influence on the spectra. Also, the performance of different regression algorithms and their ability to analyze the relationship between leaf spectra and LNC determines the regression results. Therefore, the fitting line of the scatter deviates from the 1:1 line, and to different extents with respect to different detectors and regression algorithms. The nearer to the 1:1 line indicates a better regression result.Boosting and bagging have a sound theoretical base as classifiers and regression methods. In the experiments of Quinlan [39] with various datasets, boosting appeared be a more effective method in classifying than bagging. However, in this study, bagging generally presented more accurate predictions of LNC than LSBoost, regardless of the dataset used. This could be caused by the difference in the sensitivity to noise of the two methods. Tzeng et al. [60] found that boosting tends to perform poorly in terms of accuracy when there is noise in the data. In contrast, bagging is not very sensitive to noise in the data. The RF algorithm has become increasingly popular in many different applications [61]. RF is an improvement of bagging. However, it performed similarly with Bag in this study in terms of accuracy, and its performance was more stable with a varying number of base learners. The feed-forward BPNN is the type of neural network that is most commonly used in remote sensing [45]. BPNN provided the best overall performance in terms of accuracy estimating rice LNC among all the investigated algorithms in this study, that is, highest for ASD and second highest for MSL and HSL compared with other methods. Neural approaches have been shown to be more accurate than other techniques, and are insensitive to incomplete or noisy data [46]. However, overfitting is also often encountered because of its powerful representation ability. Early stopping and regularization help address this problem [62]. Ensuring that the global minimum instead of a local minimum is found by means of simulated annealing and genetic algorithms is important [63,64]. SVR presented rice LNC estimation using MSL data with the highest precision, and ASD as the second highest compared with other algorithms. With a clear theoretical foundation, SVM is favored in remote sensing classification and regression [65,66]. However, the regression relationship between HSL and LNC established by v-SVR using kernel RBF was not as good as those of Bag, RF, and BPNN. Theoretically, SVR has a more powerful transferability than BPNN because it aims at minimizing the structured risk and has a global optimum. A dataset that covers a wider range is required to test whether the good performance of BPNN over SVR stands in terms of predicting vegetation LNC.Table 1 and Figure 2 and Figure 5 show that the spectra measured by HSL generally presented a stronger relationship to rice LNC than MSL and is stronger or comparable with ASD. Fusing passive images and LiDAR data introduce sophisticated problems of registration [67]. With more bands in the system, the spectral characteristics of targets can be accurately characterized and the full potential of the backscattered intensity of laser light can be gained. Nevalainen et al. [68] investigated several vegetation indexes measured by a HSL system in reflecting nitrogen in oat samples (R2 = 0.757, RMSE = 0.37 mg/g). The exploration was promising but tentative because of limited samples. A dual-wavelength system was employed in assessing crop foliar nitrogen with better results than a single green laser wavelength (R2 = 0.47 versus 0.72) [13] and can be improved with more laser wavelengths. The detector ASD has more bands (601 in this study versus 32) with a finer spectral resolution than HSL. In contrast, LiDAR has a smaller FOV, and the laser return allows different types of surfaces to be resolved in the vertical dimension, resulting in a more accurate detection, while the radiance measured using ASD is a function of the total vertical column [67].More samples of different rice varieties across locations are required to test the transferability of BPNN in the accurate estimation of rice LNC. Several researchers have proposed using multiple kernels learning in SVR to deal with problems where single-kernel may be insufficient [69,70]. Our next step is to extend the experience with the MSL and HSL systems in leaf spectra toward canopy spectra, where the circumstance is much more sophisticated. Many factors have an influence on the canopy reflectance that have to be considered, such as the leaf area index, leaf inclination distribution, relative leaf size, and soil background, etc. [71]. In addition, it should be noted that it is not always possible to retrieve the actual leaf constituents from leaf or canopy reflectance. This is because very similar reflectance spectra can be obtained from very different combinations of input parameters (leaf constituents, viewing angles, canopy architecture and soil background, etc.), leading to the well-known “ill-posed” problem [29,72]. Though the inverse problem is by nature ill-posed, some measures can be taken to help alleviate it, such as restriction of ranges of input parameters and using prior information [24,73]. One of the future directions of MSL/HSL is to make it more compact and mounted on vehicles and UAVs for wider application.", 4. Discussion,None,4
781,"This study investigated the performance of six popular linear and nonlinear regression algorithms to predict paddy rice LNC using the spectra from three different passive and active sensors: ASD, MSL, and HSL. Furthermore, the influence of parameter values, transfer functions, kernels, and regression types on the estimation results at a leaf scale from the reflectance spectra was verified.The results demonstrate that BPNN has a greater ability to characterize the relationship between reflectance spectra and rice LNC than other investigate algorithms and provided generally satisfactory results on all passive and active spectra (R2: 0.69–0.78). The HSL constructed a regression relationship with higher R2 compared with MSL and higher or comparable results to ASD regardless of the algorithm adopted.The results also show that HSL is capable of estimating vegetation biochemical properties. The advantage of the HSL over the MSL is obvious. Further work will be performed to extend the results of different datasets and locations and investigate the canopy scale.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
782,"Temporal series of lidar data (TSL) are increasingly available and used to estimate forest carbon. Net primary production (NPP) is the difference between carbon fixed through photosynthesis and released through respiration. Estimates of forest NPP as growth—and debris-fall as mortality—rely on field-collected databases that show that environmental controls [1], as well as individual tree size [2] and age [3], and forest composition [4] determine growth rates, while local environmental conditions and species composition control mortality [1]. However, field sampling to confidently estimate forest biomass, forest canopy carbon gain as NPP, and debris-fall as forest canopy carbon loss in carbon-rich but difficult-to-access boreal forests of Alaska, Canada, Scandinavia, and Russia is expensive and time-consuming.Remote sensing reduces costs and increases the precision of the estimates of standing biomass and carbon [5,6] through spectral imagery, lidar [7], and aerial photography’s structure from motion (SfM [8]). Many recent applications of remote sensing to measure forest carbon rely on metrics of forest canopy structure [9] extracted from canopy height models (CHMs). Although many current analyses provide distributions of net change in aboveground carbon [10], none have separated TSL into statistical distributions of forest NPP (G, as in growth, with units of carbon mass per unit area per unit time) and forest debris-fall (D, as in death, with units of carbon mass per unit area per unit time) that determine the observed net change (U) in aboveground carbon [11], and so are hampered in their application to identify likely covariates with forest NPP and debris-fall rates.The generalized method of moments (GMM), little known in the field of remote sensing, is a flexible technique to estimate statistical parameters based on distributional moments that was developed by Hansen [12] as a key econometric method. Both least squares regression and maximum likelihood are special cases of GMM [13]. We apply GMM using the R package gmm (written by the second author) to resolve the observed distributions of differenced lidar estimates of forest canopy carbon into unobserved, latent variable distributions of forest canopy carbon gain, G, and loss, D, rates. The process is sometimes refered to as deconvolution. We then show that variability in topography, forest composition, and canopy structure explain variability in mean G and D rates, thus providing an ecologically relevant deconvolution of TSL. We have found no prior attempt to statistically separate differenced values of remote sensing products (like lidar-derived CHMs) that have been collected as a time series into latent variables with ecological interpretations (such as growth and death).Our application of the generalized method of moments is a novel approach in remote sensing using lidar. However, it could also be extended to SfM or to other repeated time applications of remote sensing at the same location where the differences over time are partitioned among categorical variables, such as sampling strata or vegetation type, when the researcher is interested in the distributions of process-oriented latent variables that determine the observed differences. Here we provide an example using changes in above-ground biomass estimated from lidar collected over a decadal interval in a boreal forest in southcentral Alaska. We deconvolve the change in biomass into G and D and compare their distributions across both numerical and categorical co-variates to generate ecological hypotheses about NPP and debris-fall.", 1.

783,"The study covered 150 km2 of boreal forest (N 61.3 W 149.7 WGS 84) in southcentral Alaska. Fieldwork (Appendix A); previous vegetation classifications [19,20]; timber volume estimates [21]; and long-term vegetation monitoring [22] also informed this project. Species of early successional broadleaf trees (Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides, P. balsamifera) and late successional needleleaf trees (Picea glauca, P. mariana) formed the overstory community above a tall-shrub understory of Alnus and Salix. Forests and woodlands were classified by “vegetation type:” Mixed broadleaf-needleleaf forest (55% of the area), Broadleaf (>75% of Betula or Populus cover; 34%), and Needleleaf forest (>75% Picea cover; 11%). “Canopy structure” was classified as Woodland (<5% canopy cover), Open forest (<60% canopy cover), or Closed forest (≥60% canopy cover). The study area was below 475 m·asl “elevation” (Low ≤ 75 m·asl < High) within the Cook Inlet Basin Lowlands ecoregion [23]. The ecoregion is subject to ~50 y cycles of spruce-beetle irruptions (Curculionidae: Dendroctonus ruifipennis) [24] and ~500 y cycles of wildfires [25]. These disturbances lead to widespread Picea mortality and replacement by broadleaf growth. The last beetle irruption occurred in the mid-1990s and the last major burn in the late-1700s [19]. Foehn and other winds are a frequent disturbance and damage agent responsible for episodic debris-fall and windthrow. Sustained 2-min gusts > 50 km·h−1 occur at ~10 y cycles as recorded at nearby Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport (TSI: 40 m·asl; max > 175 km·h−1 in 2012).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1.

These point densities differed because the lidar instrument models differed in their pulse frequency. We did not have access to raw lidar point files from 2002 and were provided with 1m resolution canopy height models (CHM). For 2015 lidar, the vendor performed laser point classification using Merrick Advanced Remote Sensing (MARS®) LiDAR software (https://coast.noaa.gov/htdata/lidar2_z/geoid12b/data/8406/supplemental/ak2015_anchorage_m8406_lidar_report.pdf, (accessed on 24 February 2021)).The lowland flights occurred on 7–8 June 2002 and 12 May 2015, and upland flights occurred on 14 June 2002 and 31 May 2015 (15 d apart). Lidar was flown both years after the mean daily temperatures had surpassed 10 °C, suggesting similar phenology for both missions. April and May temperatures at TSI were warmer in 2015 than 2002 with temperatures 14–19 d advanced (mean = 16.5 d apart) in 2015 relative to 2002 (Figure S1). Cumulative precipitation sums at TSI between 1 April and dates of lidar missions were similar (26.3 vs. 25.9 mm). We used two Landsat scenes (2002 and 2015) to compare snow distributions during lidar flights and found that above 600 m asl snow persisted longer in 2002. Modeling a windthrow event of 2012 (Appendix B) used lidar collected during leaf-off conditions in September–October 2009. Digital elevation models (DEM2009) and CHMs were obtained at 1m resolution, then aggregated by the mean into 13m pixels (169 m2) to match FIA-style subplot size (168.6 m2) [26] used for biomass (B) and carbon (C = B/2) allometric estimates. We refer to the aggregated CHMs as CHM2002 and CHM2015 for the 13m products of 2002 and 2015, respectively. Because lidar densities differed between the 2002 and 2015 missions, and because lidar pulse-rate biases order statistics [27,28], whereas the mean is unbiased, we used the means, although other studies have found that differences in point cloud densities do not significantly impact estimates [14,29].", 2.

.The modeling approach assumes that for fixed values of elevation, vegetation type, and canopy structure (e.g., low elevation, Closed Mixed, 10–12 m tall forest), D is exponentially distributed because it represents primarily singular removal events (e.g., a windstorm), while G represents an accrual of incremental events (e.g., daily growth over a season). However, when combining samples from different height classes within the same vegetation type, we expect the distribution of loss rates D to include multiple exponential distributions and so apply a more general gamma distribution.The probability density function (PDF) of the difference of two exponential distributions has a closed, analytic form of two scale parameters with a mode at zero. The PDF of the difference of two gamma distributions possesses a non-zero mode, but requires four parameters and has no closed, analytic form, hampering maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods of fit. The PDF of the difference of a gamma and an exponential random variable allows a non-zero mode with only three parameters. Here, when applying deconvolution of observed 

Δ
H

 by height class within a given vegetation type, we consider the deconvolution model between gamma G and exponential D with a total of three parameters; however, when applying deconvolution across forest heights within a vegetation type, we also fit the more general difference of gamma distributions with a total of four parameters. We chose between three and four parameter models using the two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnoff (KS) statistic comparing the observed pixel data (i.e., histograms in Figure 1) to one million draws from the best-fit gamma difference models (i.e., blue curves in Figure 1), choosing the model with the lower KS-statistic (see below).We used the un-centered moment equations for the difference of two gamma distributions U = G–D as the expectation of the nth power of U [31] in our application of GMM

Prior to the GMM deconvolution of our dataset we tested the method with deconvolution of random simulated differences between gamma distributed variables with known distributions. The method worked well in recovering the known distribution parameters for large samples (n ≥ 104) but poorly for small ones (n ≤ 103).To simplify the search for start values, we assumed that carbon loss through debris-fall was exponentially distributed with c = 1 and used the first three centered moments to find starting values of a, b, and d:

It shows a rather poor fit indicated by a relatively large two-sample KS-statistic (KS-stat > 0.03), a fit improved when considering landscape covariates (see Results).We checked fits of varying moment conditions and parameter vectors using the two-sample KS-statistic.

All three vegetation types increased in G monotonically below 9 m. Mixed forest showed a more constant G above 7 m than Broadleaf growth. Broadleaf G was nearly identical at 3 m canopy (96 gC·m−2·y−1) and 19 m (95 gC·m−2·y−1) heights. Carbon gain rates, D, increased with height class for all three vegetation types (Figure 3), but were relatively constant for Broadleaf forests from 11–17 m.In each vegetation type, D increased with height more steeply than did G, consistent with an equilibrium height HtE where

Less abundant Needleleaf forest, generally a self-replacing successional sere, grew to Ht0.999 = 16.5 m, within 0.6 m of calculated equilibrium canopy height (HtE = 17.1 m).

Based on the first three centered moments the deconvolution model fit Needleleaf forests best and Broadleaf worst; however, the KS-statistic (Figure 4) suggested the deconvolution model fit all four Mixed forests below 200 m asl (KS = 0.01) better than other vegetation types. Eight of the 16 combinations demonstrated KS ≤ 0.02 (relatively good fits) and three combinations KS ≥ 0.04 (relatively poor fits).Across all 16 structure-vegetation type-elevation factor combinations displayed in Figure 4, net canopy carbon change

Δ

 was greater than Open or Woodland structure 

Δ

 for fixed elevation and vegetation type.In contrast, canopy NPP as G and debris-fall as D showed evidence of interactions among factors, suggesting that canopy NPP and debris-fall respond in a complex fashion to environmental conditions. A clear interaction effect was presented as elevation:vegetation type on G and D rates (Figure 5b). At Low elevation G for both Open and Closed Broadleaf was greater than for Needleleaf, while at High elevation the reverse held: G for both Open and Closed Needleleaf was greater than for Broadleaf.Perhaps responding to the last decade of elevational-dependent warming, the highest NPP rates as G were, surprisingly, in Needleleaf High elevation forests (Closed and Open; Figure 4, top row) and Open Broadleaf Low elevation forests (Figure 4, third row, third column). Low NPP rates as G were associated with Woodland and Open Mixed forest above 200 m (Figure 4, bottom row).Consistent with increased exposure to damaging mountain winds, the highest debris-fall rates as D rates were in Open High elevation forests of all three vegetation types (Figure 4, right column) and it was increased D rate, not reduced G rate, that led to High elevation forests of all types having the smallest 

Δ
H

 (Figure 5a), again consistent with more debris-fall where wind damage was highest.The estimates for NPP as G in Mixed forest were intermediate between Broadleaf and Needleleaf in all cases (Figure 4, top three rows) but Closed Mixed High elevation (above 75 m asl) forest where the Mixed forest G was lowest, suggesting a somewhat weak, three-way interaction among all covariates (Figure 5b). Similarly, the vegetation:elevation interaction for D presented as a greater Broadleaf Low elevation D than Needleleaf Low elevation D, yet greater Open Needleleaf High elevation D than Open Broadleaf High elevation D (Figure 5c). Among High elevation Closed forests, the weak three-way interaction was apparent where Mixed forest was again the smallest flux (Figure 5c).The interactions described above highlight the potential difficulty of assigning carbon loss from the canopy into the forest floor brown pool without deconvolution of differenced repeat standing carbon measurements. For example, canopy carbon loss D was similar in Mixed Woodland and Mixed Closed Low elevation (i.e., 41 gC·m−2·y−1; Figure 5c), even though differences between Mixed Woodland and Closed Mixed Low elevation ∆H exceeded 102 gC·m−2·y−1 (Figure 5a). A focus on net canopy carbon change would obscure these similar rates in debris-fall.", 3. Results," 3.4. Predictors of C Gain and C Loss: Canopy Structure, Taxonomic Composition and Elevation",3
791,"We have shown a novel application of the econometric method known as the “generalized method of moments” [12,13] to uncover strictly positive latent variables from differenced time series of lidar data (TSL) in a useful forest ecological context. Here, the differenced TSL were changes in forest carbon estimated using lidar-assisted regression. The latent variables uncovered were gamma distributed canopy carbon loss interpreted as debris-fall and canopy carbon gain interpreted as NPP. The distributions of debris-fall and NPP provided critical insight into the forest ecology under study in southcentral Alaska and were used for forest carbon accounting [36].Forest NPP cannot be measured directly [37] and despite its importance, debris-fall is rarely fully measured at all. Field challenges have led to eddy co-variance approaches and more recently RSPs to measure NPP. The statistical technique and CRAN-available R package here are novel in the field of remote sensing as applied to TSL-assisted measurements of forest canopy carbon. The observations of net change in landscape assessments of forest canopy carbon can be considered as the difference in two, non-negative random variables, here interpreted as canopy carbon gain from forest canopy NPP minus canopy carbon loss from debris-fall. This simple model treats the two rates as independent draws from gamma distributed variables whose difference is measurable with sequential remote sensing, such as lidar and SFM. We present results of a deconvolution of serial canopy height measurements using lidar into NPP and debris-fall distributions using the generalized method of moments [12] with the second author’s package gmm [13]. Deconvolution of net change in canopy height at the landscape scale during 1.3 decades of forest dynamics in southcentral Alaska suggests that canopy level NPP and debris-fall rates covary with landscape position, canopy structure, taxonomic composition, and their interactions, results hidden in the distributions of net change alone.Applying the method in an ecological context, we found that high elevation forests likely deposited 50–100% more biomass and carbon as debris-fall than lower elevation forests, yet canopy NPP in both high and low elevation forests were potentially within 30% of each other (canopy carbon gain: 102–135 gC·m−2·y−1) when averaged over 13 years. We estimate Woodland canopy NPP as one-half to one-fifth the rate of equivalent forest types of different structure, but with debris-fall similar to low elevation forests of similar type but differing structure. The lowest debris-fall rates were observed in low elevation Needleleaf forests and Needleleaf Woodland, suggesting that Needleleaf forest had the least debris-fall. Given the donor-pool dominated nature of C-cycling [18], if more litter flows into brown pools, then more carbon is likely available for burial in black pools, where the greatest proportion of boreal carbon is stocked. Thus, soil carbon pools in higher elevation Needleleaf forests may be growing increasingly carbon-rich relative to warmer, lower elevation Needleleaf forests pools. In lower elevation Needleleaf forests, a combination of less influx from lower rates of debris-fall and more outflux due to warmer temperatures leaves less soil carbon [38] than in higher elevation Needleleaf forests.Canopy carbon NPP and debris-fall covaried with canopy structure measured as canopy height and canopy closure. In particular, while net change in canopy carbon decreased with increasing canopy height, NPP in mixed and broadleaf forests increased to a maximum, then decreased, while debris-fall rates in all forests increased with forest canopy height. This result is consistent with forest-stand studies showing that aboveground NPP peaks early in stand development and gradually declines by about a third [33] as size-mediated aging reduces vigor in tree above-ground NPP [3]. Here, Broadleaf forest NPP declined by 29% from a maximum where canopy height was 11 m to a minimum where canopy height was 19 m. These results motivate an additional hypothesis limiting stand height below that occurs below physiological constraints [39]: when canopy NPP equals debris-fall, as through disturbance, then net carbon accumulation in the canopy can be considered at equilibrium. This is a canopy-specific example of the well-documented ecosystem dynamic that total carbon converges to a fixed value as carbon losses come to equal inputs [18].The novel approach of estimating NPP and debris-fall presented here is potentially informative and merits further study and application, but, like all models, suffers from several weaknesses. The most critical is the assumption of independence of draws of NPP and debris-fall. The model’s accuracy is insensitive to correlated means of NPP and debris-fall; however, simulations with correlation between the variable values chosen randomly—a violation of the independence assumption—leads to misleading results. While we report the means of NPP and debris-fall as gC·m−2·y−1, re-measuring forests at these mass (g), spatial (m2), and temporal (y) scales would likely strongly violate independence, because small-scale growth and damage may strongly co-vary and so not be independent. Re-measurements for the estimates we present occurred at the decadal scale and were aggregated at over 150 m2. At this longer and larger spatio-temporal scale, covariance between NPP and debris-fall is likely de-coupled because longer time spans and spatial aggregation permit the stochastic nature of damage and disturbance events determining debris-fall to operate independently from favorable growth conditions affecting canopy NPP. While we have not done so, changing units to reflect the scale of measurements (e.g., kgC 102m−2·decade−1) would be a more accurate approach.A second weakness is that while deconvolution appears to successfully disentangle the distribution of the difference of two lidar measurements as “G rate minus D rate”, calling the two variables “NPP” and “debris-fall” do not make them so. We offer three crude checks against the calculations to at least constrain their values: (1) We compare estimates of NPP rate from deconvolution to independently derived estimates from trees aged and allometrically-sized for carbon together with plot-based tree counts and (2) show that covariates increasing the probability of windthrow during the 2012 extreme wind event also increase debris-fall, but (3) find that a regional downed forest bole decay rate for log decomposition applied to field measures of downed forest debris under-predicts debris-fall from the study-site wide deconvolution.Comparing canopy-level NPP here with other Alaskan studies. With respect to point (1) in the above paragraph, deconvolution of net carbon change gave landscape-wide mean NPP of 111 gC·m−2·y−1 and debris-fall of 67 gC·m−2·y−1. We counted 644 trees (DBH > 10 cm) among 59 field plots (Appendix A), then aged and measured 114 individual trees of three species outside the study plots providing an estimate of mean biomass accumulation increment per tree as

1.4 × 103 gC·y−1·tree−1 (se = 80 gC·y−1). Multiplying trees·plot−1 by gC·y−1·tree−1, then averaging across plots gave 95% CI 78–103 gC·m−2·y−1 (Figure 1b), 7% less than the deconvolution mean NPP. Published field values for Alaskan forest NPP are scarce, but Gower et al. [33] report mean aboveground forest stand carbon divided by stand age (MAI) for Interior Alaska Picea glauca (48–55 gC·m−2·y−1) and Betula papyrifera (104 gC·m−2·y−1), suggesting that the method presented here estimates MAI when applied at the decadal scale we sampled. Gower et al. provide aboveground NPP (i.e., NPP as used here representing canopy carbon) from a three-year study of the same stands as 260–310 and 540 gC·m−2·y−1 but indicate that MAI and NPP are strongly correlated (r2 = 0.65, p < 0.01) across boreal NPP studies and recommend applying the regression of NPP on MAI as means of estimating NPP. We speculate that deconvolution at the decadal and landscape scale estimates MAI more closely than annual NPP; however, more study on the relationship between MAI and annual NPP, in general, is warranted.Comparing covariates of debris-fall here with a fifty-year wind event. Of 11 covariates explored to predict large patches of windthrow in a logistic regression of windthrow from the 2012 wind event, the lowest AIC model included 95th percentile of CHM, elevation, and topographic position index (Appendix B). As with debris-fall, the probability of windthrow increased with elevation and canopy height (Figure S3a). Mapping windthrow probability at low elevations across the study area (Figure S3b) showed that 90% of windthrow occurred within Broadleaf, 10% within Mixed and none in Needleleaf forest, results consistent with Low elevation Broadleaf debris-fall as more than double Needleleaf debris-fall and Mixed intermediate (Figure 5c).Regional decomposition rates back-calculated as debris-fall for comparison with estimates here. Disturbance damages and kills trees, depositing woody debris and leaf litter on the forest floor through debris-fall. Downed debris surveys across the study area (Appendix A) estimated a mean (se) density of downed debris as

793,"Mangroves have attracted considerable attention due to their unique morphological characteristics and diverse eco-environmental service functions [1]. These services include coastal protection, biodiversity maintenance, and carbon sequestration [2,3,4,5]. The organic carbon in mangrove forests per unit area is four times higher than that of other terrestrial forest ecosystems [6]. Mangroves are therefore considered a strong candidate for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the payments for ecosystem services (PES) program [7], and the policymaking and implementation in blue carbon. However, all these initiatives require accurate biomass and carbon stock estimations. The aboveground biomass (AGB) of mangroves is one of the fundamental parameters describing a mangrove ecosystem’s functioning and is essential for determining its storage of carbon. Accurate estimate of AGB is critical for mangrove monitoring and management. To build a beautiful China and protect the ecological marine environment, local governments of coastal areas in China have been asked to fully implement the bay chief system (A leader responsible system in governance of bays began in 2017, which was proposed by the State Oceanic Administration, China.) and conduct pilot work on carbon sinks in marine ecosystems. Strengthening the research on mangrove biomass will help to support this work.Biomass estimation methods can be categorized into direct and indirect methods. The direct approach is a traditional field harvesting method. Among the indirect methods, the allometric estimation is the most common approach and has become a standard tool for biomass prediction [8]. The basic theory of allometric relationships suggests that in many organisms, the growth rate of one part of an organism is proportional to the growth rate of growth of another [9]. Thus, researchers have often used allometric regression equations based on available and measurable woody plant parameters such as stem diameter, tree height, or crown diameter to estimate biomass [10,11].To improve the accuracy of mangrove biomass estimation and mapping, more remote sensing data and methods have been tested and applied to mangroves [4,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]. Very high resolution images, such as WorldView-2 (Digitalglobe, Westminster, CO, USA), GeoEye (GeoEye, Herndon, VA, USA), IKONOS (Spacing Imaging, Herndon, VA, USA), QuickBird (Digitalglobe, Westminster, CO, USA), digital photographs, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point cloud data, can be used for extracting individual trees [21,22,23,24,25,26], as well as the accurate estimation of AGB or carbon stocks at the individual tree level [27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34]. Yin and Wang (2019) used UAV LiDAR to study the individual tree detection and delineation (ITDD) of mangroves and proposed a rule-of-thumb that the spatial resolution should be finer than one-fourth of the crown diameter for ITDD [26]. To date, to the best of our knowledge, no study has discriminated mangrove species and estimated mangrove biomass in a finer resolution, such as individual tree or clump level. In addition, despite the wide use of remote sensing techniques to obtain and retrieve mangrove information, there is no general consensus approach [35]. Because of the ability to provide spectral information, optical images are considered to be very useful in distinguishing plant species [36]. While, LiDAR data can provide more information about forest structure [32,33]. Therefore, the integration use of very high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery and UAV LiDAR data may provide the potential for mangrove biomass estimation and mapping at finer resolution.The overall aim of this study was to use optical remote sensing, UAV LiDAR, field survey data sets, and allometric equations to estimate and map the AGB of mangroves in Qinglan harbor, Hainan province, China. In this study, we aimed to (1) compare the merits and demerits of AGB estimation based on the newly proposed individual tree-based inference method and the grid-based RF model method, (2) examine the accuracies of AGB estimation for two methods, and (3) map the AGB of mangroves.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
794,"The study was conducted in the core area of the Qinglan Harbor Provincial Nature Reserve, located on the northeastern part of Hainan Island, China (Figure 1). The Qinglan Harbor Nature Reserve is the reserve that has the most abundant mangrove species in China, including 24 true mangrove species and 10 semi-mangrove species, which account for 88.89% and 100% of the total number of true- and semi-mangrove species in China, respectively. In China, mangroves in the Qinglan Harbor Nature Reserve are distributed with the tallest plants, the oldest forests, the most complete community preservation, and many rare and endangered mangrove species. The total mangrove area of the Qinglan Harbor Nature Reserve is about 835.5 ha.The study area was 386.32 ha, with a mangrove area of 209.99 ha. The landforms are mainly sea alluvial plain, lagoon plain, sea platform, and mangrove beach. The soil type is mostly alluvial soil with a smooth soil texture (silty clay). The mean annual temperature is about 24.1 ℃, the average annual rainfall is around 1650 mm and the average tidal range is about 0.89 m. The salinity of its water ranges between 3‰ and 25‰.", 2.

795,"The field surveys were conducted from July to September 2018 and March 2019. A total of 45 plots were surveyed. The base plot area was 10 × 10 m, which was expanded up to 600 m2 depending on the specific field situation. All individual trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of ≥1.5cm and height that was ≥1.5 m within the plots were counted and measured for species, number, height, stem girth at breast height (GBH, cm; DBH = GBH/π), and crown cover. A real-time kinetic global positioning system (RTK-GPS) was used to measure the geographical position of each plot and most of measured trees. A total of 3832 individual trees and 13 species (Bruguiera sexangula (Lour.) Poir., Excoecaria agallocha Linn., Rhizophora apiculata Blume, Aegiceras corniculatum (Linn.) Blanco, Kandelia candel (Linn.) Druce, Xylocarpus granatum Koenig, Ceriops tagal (Perr.) C. B. Rob., Lumnitzera racemosa Willd., Heritiera littoralis Dryand., Hibiscus tiliaceus Linn., Sonneratia apetala Buch-Ham., Sonneratia alba J. Smith, Sonneratia ovata Backer) were recorded in the 45 field plots. 68.89% of the plots had at least 3 types of mangrove species. The mangrove forest was dominated by B. sexangula. The tree density of B. sexangula was highest among all mangrove species, which was 1.5 times and 2.0 times higher than that of E. agallocha and L. racemosa, respectively. The summary of the community structure of the mangrove forest in Qinglan Harbor Nature Reserve was presented in Table 1.The AGB in each field plot was estimated by the allometric equation method. The selection principles were as follows: (1) Domestic models take precedence over foreign models; (2) the closer the study area of the model to Hainan, the more preferred it is; (3) the closest forest age takes precedence; and (4) species with similar DBH are preferred. When no specific allometric equation was available, a common allometric equation was used (Table 2). We first calculated the AGB of each tree using the species-specific allometric equations presented in Table 2 and then summed the AGBs in each field plot. To obtain the AGB density for each plot, we divided the summed AGB of a plot by the plot’s area.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Field Data Collection,2
796," 2.3.1. WorldView-2 ImageryThe WorldView-2 optical images were acquired on 5 October 2018. They included a 0.5 m panchromatic band and eight 2.0 m multispectral bands.First the images were radiometrically corrected. Then, the multispectral images were pan-sharpened by the panchromatic image using the NNDiffuse tool in ENVI 5.3 (Harris Geospatial, Melbourne, FL, USA). Finally, this pan-sharpened imagery was co-registered to the UAV LiDAR data. The precision was controlled within 0.5 pixels. The mangrove extent of the study area was extracted using this processed imagery. The detail process of how to extract mangrove extent using high spatial resolution imagery can refer to our previous work [45]. The main flowchart of remote sensing data processing and AGB estimation was presented in Figure 2. 2.3.2. UAV LiDAR Data and Mangrove Canopy Height Model ProductionThe UAV LiDAR data were collected in March 2018 using a Velodyne VLP-16 puck sensor (Velodyne LiDAR, San Jose, CA, USA) with a laser wavelength of 903 nm. The sensor can emit 300,000 points per second with an accuracy of 3 cm. The average point density was 94 points/m2. The flight elevation was 52 m with a speed of 5 m/s. An RTK-GPS was simultaneously used to obtain the base station position of the UAV LiDAR system with centimeter-level accuracy.The raw LiDAR data were first computed using aerial triangulation algorithm to obtain accurate position of each LiDAR point cloud. Then, the noise and outlier points of the LiDAR data were filtered using LiDAR360 software (GreenValley, Beijing, China). Subsequently, the point clouds were classified as non-ground and ground points. The ground points were used to produce the digital elevation model (DEM) using the triangulated irregular net (TIN) interpolation method. Both the ground points and non-ground points were utilized to generate the digital surface model (DSM) using the inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation method. The canopy height model (CHM) was produced through subtracting the DEM from the DSM [5]. Finally, the point clouds were normalized using the DEM subtraction method [26] and masked by the mangrove extent, which was produced from the WorldView-2 imagery.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3.

799,"The mangrove classification was conducted in the R language platform using random forest (RF) algorithm. RF, proposed by Leo Breiman (2001) [46], is an integrated machine learning algorithm based on decision trees. The bootstrap re-sampling is used to construct the decision tree model by randomly sampling from the original sample set. The final result is obtained by voting on the prediction of multiple decision trees. The RF algorithm can be used to classify remote sensing images with complex spatial distribution or to identify multiple data of different statistical distributions and scales.From the spectral curves of different mangrove species in Figure 3 and the 0.5 m pan-sharpened WorldView-2 imagery, we found that S. ovata, S. apetala, and S. alba communities and the mixed community of S. ovata and A. corniculatum have similar appearances, textures, and spectral features overall, which means they are difficult to separate. In addition, S. ovata, S. apetala, and S. alba belong to the same genus of Sonneratia. Therefore, these three species were merged into a class of Sonneratia spp. H. littoralis and K. candel were hard to discriminate because of their small coverage areas. C. tagal was usually mixed with L. racemosa in the study area. A. corniculatum and X. granatum were companion species growing with dominant species, so it was difficult to identify them. Thus, the mangrove species in the study area were categorized into six types: B. sexangula (BS), E. agallocha (EA), Sonneratia spp. (SS, including S. alba, S. apetala, and S. ovata), R. apiculata (RA), H. tiliaceus (HT), and L. racemosa (LR).With the development of remote sensing technology, individual tree extraction based on very high-density point clouds is becoming possible [19,26,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54]. Using the marker-controlled watershed segmentation (MCWS) algorithm [55], Yin and Wang (2019) well detected and delineated individual mangrove tree [26]. Their result indicated that the spatial resolution of CHM should be finer than one-quarter of the crown diameter (CD) in order to correctly delineate crown boundaries and characterize the crown shapes. In the field survey, we found that the crown diameters of a large amount of L. racemosa and low B. sexangula ranged from 1.0 to 1.5 m. Therefore, the individual tree was detected based on a 0.25 m spatial resolution CHM, which obtained from the point cloud data of UAV LiDAR.After mangrove individual tree detection, a total of 6800 samples of the six mangrove species types were randomly collected based on our field survey with a uniform distribution in the study area. These samples all lay in homogeneous and monoculture communities. Of the 6800 patches, 70%, namely, 4760, were used as training samples and the other 30%, namely, 2040, were used as independent validation samples.For the RF classification model, the parameter ntree was set to 1000 and mtry was set to the default value

 (mtry denotes the number of predictor variables input). We have tested the values of 500, 600, 700, 800, 1000, 1500, and 2000 for the ntree parameter, and found that when ntree reached 1000 with mtry using

, the error become convergent. For the detail tuning process of the ntree parameter, refer to the study of Pham and Brabyn (2017) [18].

800,"Based on the mangrove species classification map at individual tree level and the obtained tree heights and crown diameters from the UAV LiDAR data, we could divide the mangrove trees into five strata for each species. The nature break method in ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA) was used for the stratification. Because we have measured 3832 trees and obtained their heights, crown cover, and species, we first classified these trees into the above five strata for each species. Subsequently, we summed the AGB and the crown cover area according to the six mangrove species and the five tree height levels (Equation (1)). We divided the summed AGB by the corresponding summed area to obtain an AGB density for each species at each height level. Finally, these stratum AGB density values were applied to each individual tree and clump based on its species and height level to produce a mangrove AGB map for this study area (case 1, Figure 2). The proposed AGB estimation method was named individual tree-based inference method.

To construct the inversion model, the random forest algorithm was employed due to the good performance of RF in biomass prediction [18,46]. The size of the grid is 10 × 10 m, which is the same to the minimum size of field plots. Prior to fitting model, we extract 52 LiDAR metrics for each field sample plot and each 10 × 10 m grid. We first linked the field estimated AGB with these LiDAR metrics and selected 11 optimal metrics (presented in Table 3). Subsequently, we constructed a prediction model based on the 11 LiDAR metrics. For the RF regression model, ntree was set to 1000 and mtry was set to the default value

801," 2.6.1. Validation Mangrove ClassificationThe producer accuracy, user accuracy, and overall accuracy were employed to assess mangrove species classification accuracy based on a confusion matrix using the 2040 independent validation samples. 2.6.2. Validation Biomass ResultThe accuracy of the biomass prediction was assessed using the coefficient of determination (R2), and root mean square error (RMSE) between field estimated and predicted values.For finer resolution AGB estimation, we used the 45-field estimated AGBs as reference data to assess the predicted AGBs. For the grid AGB estimation, namely, the benchmark case, we employed the 10-fold cross-validation method to validate the predicted AGBs. This cross-validation method is also based on the 45-field estimated AGBs. 2.6.3. Individual Tree DetectionThe actual position of the trees was determined by visual interpretation of the UAV LiDAR point clouds. The average point spacing of the UAV LiDAR point clouds is 0.16 m. So, in most cases, individual tree or clump could be identified by inspecting the point clouds from different angles [57,58,59]. When compare the visual interpretation trees and clumps with the machine segmentation trees and clumps, we could obtain accuracy from spatial matching aspect. Because the visual analysis and discrimination of individual tree and clump cannot avoid arbitrary and subjective issues. We also compared the number of actual mangrove trees within a field plot with the number of machine segmentation trees in the field plot. Therefore, the accuracy of individual tree detection was assessed by above two aspects: spatial position and number.For the spatial position aspect, we overlaid the LiDAR point clouds and the segmentation layer to identify errors. The position of each segmented tree was established as the location of the highest pixel in the set of cloud points or pixels that make up the crown [58]. The matching procedure pairs the closest observed tree location within a given radius for any segmented tree and then eliminates all the non-minimal pairs with the same observed tree [58]. The search radius in this study was set to 2 m. The mismatch types included omission (OM) and commission (CM) cases. The two mismatch cases were added up to compose the total number of mismatch (TNM, Equation (2)). Then, the total accuracy rate of segmentation (TAR) could be obtained by a ratio of the number of right segmented trees to the total number of segmented trees (TNS, Equation (3)) [58,60].


TNM = OM + CM

TAR = (TNS − TNM)/TNS × 100

where, TNM denotes the total number of mismatches, TAR denotes the total accuracy rate of tree segmentation, TNS denotes the total number of segmented trees, OM denotes omission cases, and CM denotes commission cases.For the number aspect, the number of trees (Ni) surveyed in a field plot was used as observed value. The number of individual trees (ni) derived from the individual tree segmentation in the same field sample plot was used as predicted value. Then, the ratio of the difference between the two values was used to evaluate the number accuracy. The calculation formula is as follows:


Di = (ni − Ni)/Ni

where Di is deviation degree, DA is the accuracy of the summary metric, M is the number of plots that have different segmentation results, and N is the total number of plots. Di > 0 denotes over-segmentation and Di < 0 denotes under-segmentation. When |Di| > 0.4, the deviation of segmentation is large and the accuracy is poor. When 0.3 < |Di| ≤ 0.4, the accuracy of segmentation is acceptable. When 0.2 < |Di| ≤ 0.3, the accuracy of segmentation is moderate. When 0.1 < |Di| ≤ 0.2, the segmentation accuracy is good. When |Di| ≤ 0.1, the segmentation accuracy is very good and individual tree can be accurately identified.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.6. Accuracy Assessment,2

The matching procedure pairs the closest observed tree location within a given radius for any segmented tree and then eliminates all the non-minimal pairs with the same observed tree [58]. The search radius in this study was set to 2 m. The mismatch types included omission (OM) and commission (CM) cases. The two mismatch cases were added up to compose the total number of mismatch (TNM, Equation (2)). Then, the total accuracy rate of segmentation (TAR) could be obtained by a ratio of the number of right segmented trees to the total number of segmented trees (TNS, Equation (3)) [58,60].


TNM = OM + CM


(2)



TAR = (TNS − TNM)/TNS × 100


(3)


where, TNM denotes the total number of mismatches, TAR denotes the total accuracy rate of tree segmentation, TNS denotes the total number of segmented trees, OM denotes omission cases, and CM denotes commission cases.For the number aspect, the number of trees (Ni) surveyed in a field plot was used as observed value. The number of individual trees (ni) derived from the individual tree segmentation in the same field sample plot was used as predicted value. Then, the ratio of the difference between the two values was used to evaluate the number accuracy. The calculation formula is as follows:


Di = (ni − Ni)/Ni


(4)



DA = (∑M|Di|≤0.4/N) × 100


(5)


where Di is deviation degree, DA is the accuracy of the summary metric, M is the number of plots that have different segmentation results, and N is the total number of plots. Di > 0 denotes over-segmentation and Di < 0 denotes under-segmentation. When |Di| > 0.4, the deviation of segmentation is large and the accuracy is poor. When 0.3 < |Di| ≤ 0.4, the accuracy of segmentation is acceptable. When 0.2 < |Di| ≤ 0.3, the accuracy of segmentation is moderate. When 0.1 < |Di| ≤ 0.2, the segmentation accuracy is good. When |Di| ≤ 0.1, the segmentation accuracy is very good and individual tree can be accurately identified.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.6.3. Individual Tree Detection,2
805,"The mismatching statistic of visual interpretation and segmentation results showed that the total accurate rate of segmentation position in 45 sample plots was 87.43% (Table 4).Table 5 shows the accuracy of the number of individual tree segmentation. The accuracy of all tree species except A. corniculatum tree was 57.78% and that of all tree species was 51.11% (Table 5). Because A. corniculatum trees in the study area were small, appearing as lower wood and clustering, this was not conducive to the segmentation of individual tree based on crown.There were 5 or 6 cases with over-segmentation and deviations greater than 0.4 among 45 samples, of which more than 75% had an average DBH value larger than 20 cm. The number of samples with under-segmentation and deviations greater than 0.4 in 45 samples was 15–19, and in about 80% of these samples, the average DBH value was less than 10 cm. This means that when DBH < 10 cm, the individual tree segmentation was more likely to have under-segmentation and a large deviation value.", 3. Results, 3.1. Individual Mangrove Tree Extraction,3
806,"Table 6 shows the classification accuracy of mangrove species at individual tree level. Table 7 describes the characteristics of tree patches in different mangrove species in the whole study area. Figure 4 presents the thematic map of the mangrove species.The overall classification accuracy was 86.08% with the kappa coefficient of 0.83. The majority of mangrove species could be well discriminated with the producer and user accuracies higher than 80%, except for E. agallocha and R. apiculata. The accuracies of the two species ranged from 66.27% to 74.66%.Table 7 portrays that B. sexangula and Sonneratia spp. were the two highest mangrove species (mean height 8.00 and 7.84 m, respectively) in the study area followed by R. apiculata (mean height 6.90 m). The lowest tree species is L. racemosa. Table 7 also indicates that B. sexangula and E. agallocha covered 35.01% and 18.96% of the study area, respectively, ranking first and second. The other four species each covered approximately 10% of the study area.", 3. Results, 3.2. Finer Resolution Mangrove Classification,3
807,"The resultant AGB density values for each species at five height levels were presented at Table 8. By applying these AGB density values to individual tree and clump, which have the species and height attributes derived from the UAV LiDAR and WorldView-2 data, the AGB of each patch and the mangrove AGB map of the study area at individual tree level could be obtained. The RF model based on 10 × 10 m grids and LiDAR metrics was used as benchmark and to predict the AGB. Figure 5 delineates the field estimated AGBs versus the predicted AGBs with the accuracy metrics.The R2 of the individual tree-based inference method is 0.49 with an RMSE of 48.42 Mg ha−1. While, the benchmark, the grid-based RF model method, produced a higher R2 of 0.67 and a lower RMSE of 38.95 Mg ha−1. Compared with field-estimated AGB, the maximum deviation value of AGB derived from the individual tree-based inference method was 194.01 Mg·ha−1, and the minimum deviation was 1.93 Mg·ha−1. The AGB density of the whole study area calculated from the individual tree-based inference method was 119.34 Mg·ha−1, which was lower than the AGB density produced from the grid-based RF model method (148.97 Mg·ha−1). The results show that it is feasible to use the proposed individual tree-based inference method for mangrove AGB estimation in this relatively complex mangrove forest.", 3. Results, 3.3. AGB Estimates and Prediction,3
808,"The comparison of the resultant AGB maps derived from the individual tree-based inference method and the grid-based RF model method are presented in Figure 6. According to above accuracy assessment of the two methods, the spatial distribution of the mangrove AGB in the whole study area can be better represented by the grid-based RF model method based on LiDAR metrics than the individual tree-based inference method. While, the AGB map derived from the latter method was able to portray the AGB distribution at individual tree level for each mangrove species.The two mangrove AGB maps both show that the mangrove AGB hot spots lie in the southwest and middle of the study area, while the AGB cold spots lie in the southeast and north of the study area (Figure 6). There are also several conspicuous differences between these two maps. First, the low and middle AGB areas of the left map is overall lower than the low and middle AGB areas of the right map with one level difference. Second, the very high AGB areas (>300 Mg ha−1) are more obvious in the left map and cover larger area than those in the right map. Third, the AGB values in the left map are more heterogeneous than the AGB values in the right map.Figure 7 portrays the AGB maps of different mangrove species, which were produced by the individual tree-based inference method. The AGB of B. sexangula showed obvious concentrated distribution characteristics in space with a range of 112.32 to 363.65 Mg ha−1. E. agallocha spread out the study area with middle AGB (36.53–58.53 Mg ha−1) accounting for the largest percentage. The AGB of L. racemosa was no more than 40 Mg ha−1 due to its small individuals and represented disperse distribution. Sonneratia spp. had the largest AGB value in the study area, which was mainly distributed in fringe areas to water.", 3. Results, 3.4. Spatial Distribution of Mangrove AGB,3
809,"To explore the relationship between the precision of individual-tree segmentation and the size of the mangroves, the measured DBHs in 45 samples were graded in two-centimeter intervals, and the maximum, minimum, and average DBH values in each sample were determined. Then, the Pearson correlation analysis between the DBH classification and deviation of individual-tree segmentation was completed (Table A1, Appendix A).The relationship between the DBH and the deviation was as follows: (1) The relationship between DBH and the deviation degree of individual-tree segmentation is relatively complex. Taking 14 cm as the boundary, when DBH < 14 cm, the deviation degree was negatively correlated with DBH, i.e., the deviation degree increased with the decrease in DBH. When DBH >14 cm, the deviation degree was positively correlated with DBH, and the deviation increased with the increase in DBH. This indicates that the accuracy of individual-tree segmentation decreased with the increase in DBH. When DBH < 8 cm, it was significantly negatively correlated with the DBH and the deviation, and when DBH > 30 cm, the correlation coefficient reached the maximum (0.799), it means that the accuracy of individual-tree segmentation decreased considerably. The variation of the correlation coefficient also shows that the accuracy of the segmentation number was relatively ideal within 8 cm ≤ DBH ≤ 30 cm. (2) The deviation degree has a moderate positive correlation with the maximum DBH and average DBH, but has little correlation with the minimum DBH. This means that the maximum and average DBHs are more likely to affect the accuracy of individual-tree segmentation.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Effect of Mangrove DBH on Individual Tree Segmentation,4
810,"Concerning to AGB estimation accuracy, the grid-based RF model method was relatively higher than the individual tree-based inference method. This may be due to the fact that the former had taken fully into account and selected a large number of vegetation indicators reflecting mangrove biomass information.In terms of mangrove AGB mapping, the grid-based RF model method can be well compared with the field AGB due to the same size of resample grids and field plots. However, whether this grid size is a more accurate AGB mapping method requires more tests and comparison of different sizes of resample grid. The individual tree-based inference method can well reflect the spatial distribution of AGB at different heights for mangrove species, and it is also more beneficial to managers to find problems. From the workflow of this study (Case 1, Figure 2) and the method Section 2.5, we could find that the proposed inference method is simple and it is easy to repeat this method in other mangrove forests or fields.The results of the detailed comparison between the two AGB estimation methods are shown in Table 9. Although the individual tree-based inference method is considered to provide finer individual-tree information, but the current CHM-based individual tree segmentation still has insurmountable defects. For example, many lower and smaller trees are obscured by the upper tree crown and cannot be effectively identified. In addition, clump mangrove species, such as L. racemosa, cannot be well distinguished, too. These limitations inevitably reduce the accuracy of the individual-tree segmentation and then pull down the overall estimation accuracy of the AGB.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Comparison of the Individual Tree-Based Inference Method and the Grid-Based RF Model Method,4
811,"The mangroves in the study area had an AGB value of 82.088–209.520 Mg·ha−1. Compared with the mangrove AGB in other parts of the world, the AGB of B. sexangular-dominated forest is 204.933 Mg·ha−1, lower than the value of 279.00 Mg·ha−1 in Indonesia [61]. The AGB of E. agallocha-dominated forest is 82.088 Mg·ha−1, higher than the value of 14.93 Mg·ha−1 for pure E. agallocha forest in India (Central Sundarbans) [62]. The AGB of Sonneratia spp.-dominated forest is 277.201 Mg·ha−1, higher than the value of 169.61 Mg·ha−1 in India (Western Sundarbans) [62], the value of 22.30 Mg·ha−1 in China (Guangdong, Futian) [63] and the value of 189.37 Mg·ha−1 in China (Guangdong, Leizhou) [64], but lower than the value of 281.20 Mg·ha−1 in Thailand (Southern Ranong) [65]. The AGB of R. apiculata-dominated forest is 209.52 Mg·ha−1, much lower than those of both pure and mixed forests found in tropical regions (214.00 Mg·ha−1 in India (Andaman Island) [66], 216.00 Mg·ha−1 in Thailand (Chumphon Sawi Bay) [67], 298.50 Mg·ha−1 in Thailand (Ranong Southern) [65], 295.50–350.30 Mg·ha−1 in Vietnam (Mekong delta) [68], 460.00 Mg·ha−1 in Malaysia (Matang) [69], and 356.80 Mg·ha−1 in Indonesia (Halmahera) [70]).Overall, the AGB of this study essentially aligns with the latitude law of AGB distribution in mangroves, i.e., AGB increases with the decrease in latitude.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. AGB Comparison with Mangroves in Other Areas,4
812,"In this study, we combined the advantages of WorldView-2, UAV LiDAR, and field survey data and proposed a novel method to estimate mangrove AGB at individual tree scale, i.e., individual tree-based inference method, and compared it with the benchmark grid-based RF model method. Although the AGB estimation accuracy of this new method is less than that of the grid-based RF inversion method (R2 of 0.49 vs. 0.67 and RMSE of 48.42 Mg ha−1 vs. 38.95 Mg ha−1), the individual tree-based inference method still has some merits. The individual tree-based inference method can show the spatial distribution details of mangrove AGB in different mangrove species, which is more beneficial to the fine management of mangroves. Considering that the mangrove forest in the study area is complex, the results of the newly proposed method are relatively satisfying.There are many uncertainties in mangrove AGB estimation due to sampling type, spatial resolution of remote sensing data, local topography, biophysical conditions, forest structure, wood density, tree species, size of trees, selection of allometric models, and technical factors related to data processing. Traditional field surveys are still the most important base for establishing a reliable relationship between biomass and remote sensing variables. With the support of a variety of remote sensing data, more targeted field survey methods, such as tree species, habitat, forest age and wood density, will be further tried.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
813,"Coastal wetlands are fragile and currently highly endangered ecosystems. For centuries, coastline anthropization has led to the alteration or destruction of many of these habitats. According to [1], around 50% of the world’s wetlands have been lost since 1900. Although the rate of wetland loss has decelerated in Europe and has been low in North America since the 1980s, it remains high in Asia due to the ongoing, fast-paced, large-scale transformation of natural coastal and inland wetlands. In Europe, the progressive destruction of wetlands can be traced back at least to Roman times [1,2], while it has been taking place since the 17th century in North America and southern Africa [3,4], and for at least 2000 years in China [5]. Additionally, global change, including the associated increase in sea level and eutrophication, represents another serious issue that threatens the conservation of these habitats [6].The historical preference for coastal areas to build urban and industrial settlements is the main cause for major alteration of coastal habitats. Thirty seven percent of the world’s population lives less than 100 km away from the coast [7], and 10% of the population inhabits the most vulnerable areas [8]. In the case of the European Union, half the population of the member states lived within 50 km from the coastline in 2001.Within the European context, the coast of Galicia (NW Spain) is located between the mouths of the rivers Miño, in the south, and Eo, in the northeast. It is a predominantly rocky, steep, low-altitude coast, with 86% of the coastline below 100 m high and only 0.76% reaching heights of 300 m [9]. In terms of lithology, granites and granodiorites dominate, appearing interspersed with sedimentary sections or with metamorphic rocks such as schists and slate in some areas.Structural and lithological controls have led to the presence of a markedly tortuous coastline, with alternating inlets and land protrusions extending over a length of 2100 km [10]. At the regional scale, rias, peninsulas, and straight sections of coastline can be identified in Galicia. Conversely, as the scale increases, meso- and microforms evidence the differential evolution related to patterns at more local scales. Within the defined geodynamic units, it is worth highlighting coastal cliffs and shore platforms, marshlands, and beach-dune systems. Associated with the latter, coastal wetlands can be observed, occupying around 311 hectares (ha) in 2009 [10], and in which lagoons are found. Coastal lagoons are habitats of major environmental interest, considered priority habitats by the Habitat Directive, and they must be protected by European Union member states.This study aims to characterize and identify changes, both natural and induced by anthropic activity, and their impact on the recent evolution of three different types of coastal lakes in Galicia (Louro, Vixán, and Xuño). The Louro lagoon constitutes a semi-open lagoon; the Vixán lagoon is a closed-type lagoon; and the Xuño lagoon is an example of a sand dune lagoon [11]. The secondary objective of this work is to establish the extent to which these three coastal lakes fit the definition of coastal lagoons habitats (habitat code 1150) as established by the Habitats Directive (Directive 92/43/EEC).The selected coastal lagoons are located in the Atlantic coast of the A Coruña province (Galicia, NW Iberian Peninsula). The Louro lagoon (42°45′23″ N, 9°5′36″ W) is located in the northern bank of the ria of Muros and Noia. The Xuño lagoon (42°38′0″ N, 9°2′19″ W) is located behind the Areas Longas beach, in a section of the coast that is mainly exposed to swell with a NW component (Figure 1). The Vixán lagoon (42°32′29″ N, 9°1′27″ W) is located at the end of the Barbanza peninsula, within the Corrubedo Dune Complex and Carregal and Vixán Lagoons Natural Park.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
814,"The three lagoons are located in the Atlantic coast of Galicia (NW Iberian Peninsula). This coastline features an important number of lagoons of great environmental interest, all of which are included in the Natura 2000 network. The geological substrate consists of granites and metamorphic rocks (mainly schist). This region has a maritime Mediterranean climate, annual average temperature is 14.6–16.2 °C, and average rainfall ranges from 1244 to 1828 mm/year (Figure A1). Seventy percent of this rainfall is concentrated in the period between October and March, while intense drought periods occur in the summer [12].Topographically speaking, the Louro lagoon, with an average elevation of 1.84 m above sea level (masl) calculated using laser imaging detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, and the Vixán lagoon (3.14 masl) are located between two rocky protrusions connected by a sandbar closing the direct outlet of small freshwater tributaries to the sea (Figure 1). Both of them can be classified within the coastal lagoon typology, showing a triangular (∆) shape with its apex pointing landward and its base along the seaward shore, which corresponds to a sandbar forming a beach, a well-developed dune system, and a lagoon behind it that is separated from the sea by narrow barriers of land [13]. A variety of coastal water bodies exists, ranging from areas totally enclosed by land to areas primarily exposed to the sea. The enclosed features, which are primarily shielded from the sea, are called coastal ponds and lakes. Bodies of water with outlets to the sea are called coastal bays or lagoons, depending on their shapes. Oertel in [13,14] called these features “barrier lagoons” because of their association with coastal barriers. In general, coastal lakes and lagoons form secondary coastlines behind the main ocean coastline. The inner shores of these secondary coastlines are shielded from direct exposure to ocean waves, the connection between these lagoons and the sea occurs through a channel (Figure 1), and the main difference between them lies in its functioning. In the Louro lagoon, the channel is still active; therefore, in winter, concurrently with the period of maximum water availability in the system, water overflows to the ocean, while occasional overwash or tidal pumping can lead to ephemeral periods of seawater entrance. Conversely, the channel in the Vixán lagoon is permanently closed; only prior to 1992, when the Corrubedo Dune Complex and Carregal and Vixán Lagoons Natural Park was designated, locals used to open it to drain nearby croplands. Nowadays, this activity is completely prohibited.The Xuño lagoon, with a 5.28 m elevation asl, is smaller in size and is located on the limit of the dune system associated with the Areas Longas beach (Porto do Son, A Coruña). It can be classified within the type known as cat’s eye ponds due to its small size and lenticular shape; alternatively, it could also be classified as a coastal back-barrier perched lake [15]. Its elevation is higher than in the case of the other lagoons and, therefore, seawater never reaches it. This lagoon has a small channel through which freshwater overflows into another channel connecting another coastal lagoon of larger size (San Pedro de Muro lagoon) with the sea.", 2.

815,"The functional area of each lagoon was determined using information obtained using LiDAR (laser imaging detection and ranging) by the Spanish National Geographical Institute (Instituto Geográfico Nacional de España, IGN). These data allowed for the generation of a digital terrain model (DTM) with 1 m spatial resolution. From this file, the functional area of each lagoon was delimited, considering the elevation of these areas, as well as the slopes associated with their borders. Zoning of each one was performed by photointerpretation of available aerial images and orthophotographs from the years 1956, 1984, 1989, 2001, 2004, 2008, 2010, 2014, and 2017, except for the Louro lagoon, for which the 2001 aerial image was not available. Photograms of the first two years consist of black and white images; images for the first year were obtained by the American flight, B series (1956–1957), while those for the second year were obtained from the national flight (1980–1986). Photograms for 1989 correspond to the coastal flight (1989–1991), while 2001 images come from the five-year flight (1999–2003). From 2004 onwards, color images were obtained from the National Aerial Orthophotography Program (Plan Nacional de Ortofotografía Aérea, PNOA) of the National Geographical Institute. The images used in this study represent the total available number of high-resolution images of the study areas for the analyzed period. In this case, we decided not to select satellite images because their spatial resolution would not allow for their correct comparison with aerial images and orthophotographs.Each one of the units was delimited using ArcGIS 10.5 at 1:1000 scale for all the dates, using hectares (ha) as the measurement unit to analyze variations in area coverage. The delimitation process in aerial images was done manually using different remote sensing techniques, such as color, texture, and context. It is worth noting that uncertainty is greater for older dates, due to the lower resolution of the images and the greater complexity of black and white photointerpretation [16].To determine the temporal changes that occurred in each lagoon, the following units were delimited:Free water: area permanently covered by a water sheet.Phragmites: area colonized by the community defined by Phragmites australis reed beds, characterized by the highest freshwater influence.Juncus/Scirpus: area with a higher seawater influence, occupied by Juncus maritimus, Juncus acutus, Scirpus maritimus, and S. lacustris, which often appear interspersed in the study areas.Sand or dune area: sedimentary area, either forming dunes or intertidal flats.Grass: herbaceous vegetation dominated by Paspalum vaginatum.Aquatic vegetation: floating freshwater plants such as Nymphaea alba, Utricularia australis, Potamogeton trichoides, and Littorela uniflora.The selection of the number of categories, as well as their definition, was based on the analysis of all the available images for each lagoon and the field surveys of the areas on different dates. However, this delimitation refers to the dominant species within each section and does not exclude the presence of other species sharing the same space. From this spatial information, the area and proportion covered by each category were estimated for each study year. These data allow for analyzing variations that have occurred over time and explanations as to their possible causes. Finally, seasonal variations were also analyzed by comparing images taken in late summer (September/October), corresponding to the period with lower water availability, with images taken in late spring (June).", 2.

816,"Lagoon water and sediments were sampled on different months during the 2009–2011 period. Water samples were taken in Teflon jars that had been previously treated with HCl (5%) and then rinsed several times with Milli-Q water. In the laboratory, samples were filtered through a 0.45 μm pore size. Redox potential, pH, and electrical conductivity were determined in situ using a multiparameter probe (Hanna instruments). Salinity was determined using a Hanna refractometer. Concentrations of nutrients (NH4+, NO3ˉ, and PO43−) and chlorides were determined by ion chromatography using a Dionex 4500i system (Dionex Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).Sediment samples were taken using 150 cm long PVC (polyvinyl chloride) tubes with 80 mm inner diameter. In the laboratory, sediment samples were cut in 3- to 5-cm thick segments. Sediment samples were used to determine the influence (both current and past) of seawater on each lagoon, using the degree of pyritization (concentration of pyritic S) in sediments relative to organic C content as proxy [17]. The organic C/pyritic S ratio is a proxy that allows distinguishing anoxic freshwater sediments (with low concentrations of pyrite, FeS2) from anoxic marine sediments (with high pyrite contents) [17,18,19].Organic C content was determined using a Leco autoanalyzer (after removal of carbonates with HCl 1M), and pyritic S content was determined by sequential Fe extraction, which allows for extracting Fe associated with pyrite (FeS2) (see [20,21] for additional details). From pyritic Fe content, pyritic S content was determined stoichiometrically.", 2. Material and Methods, 2.3. Geochemical Analysis of Water and Sediments,2
817,"The evolution of the occupation of the different habitats identified within the Louro lagoon is shown in Figure 2. The Louro lagoon is divided into two subsystems. The first one is located in the distal section of the lagoon and constitutes the permanently flooded area. The construction of a dyke before the 1950s contributed to this flooding. The second subsystem is constituted by a sand flat behind the dunes, which remains flooded from early autumn, when it starts to fill with the first rains, until late July. In late September, the water-covered area of the Louro lagoon is at its minimum (Figure 2b).More specifically, it is worth noting that no changes have been observed regarding the area and configuration of the lake basin; however, strong interannual oscillations have been observed in terms of area covered by free water. The photointerpretation analysis shows that the degree of flooding of the lagoon varies substantially depending on the season and the water availability. Thus, the minimum free water body was found in September 2004, with 4.4 ha, while the maximum was found in 2017, with 15.99 ha, representing a 40% variation relative to the total area of the lagoon. These variations can be clearly observed in Figure 2e, which represents free water bodies for 2004 and 2014, two years that diverged widely in terms of water availability.The area covered by the different plant communities also showed important interannual variations. Progressive colonization is observed in the area behind the dunes and in the sand flat, which was reduced by 63% between 1956 and 2017. The area covered by Phragmites australis was virtually stable (10–13%), while the area occupied by the vegetation community dominated by Scirpus maritimus and Juncus maritimus experienced a marked increase since 1956, going from 2.19 ha to over 4 ha in the first decade of the 21st century.Likewise, the area dominated by Paspalum vaginatum greatly increased from occupying 6% of the lagoon in 1956 to 56% in 2010.In the Xuño lagoon, the permanently flooded area represented a minimum portion of the lagoon (1–3%) during the 1956–2008 period (Figure 3). From 2008 onwards, this area was reduced to less than 1%. This trend continued between 2014 and 2017, when the water sheet area decreased from 0.008 ha to 0.004 ha. These values clearly show the advanced siltation state of the lagoon. As for the area colonized by the Phragmites australis community, its distribution varies throughout the analyzed period, reaching its maximum extension (61%) in 2017 and its minimum extension (28%) in 1989. As in the case of the aforementioned formation, the vegetation community dominated by Juncus maritimus and Scirpus maritimus varied irregularly during the 1956–2017 period, reaching its maximum extension in 2001 (41%) and decreasing to its minimum in 2014 (31%). Likewise, aquatic vegetation also followed an irregular pattern during this period. The maximum area covered by aquatic vegetation was 31% (0.66 ha) in 2008, while its minimum was 3% (0.07 ha) in 2017. Moreover, this lagoon showed strong seasonality in terms of degree of flooding, ranging from complete flooding of the lagoon basin in the winter to the lack of free water bodies by the end of the summer (Figure 3b).In the Vixán lagoon, the free water body experienced a generalized decrease during the 1956–2017 period (Figure 4). In 1984, the estimated area covered by free water was 3.81 ha (24%), while in 2017 it was 3.30 ha (21%). This means a loss of more than 0.50 ha of free water body. Like the aforementioned lagoons, the Vixán lagoon also experiences a marked seasonal variability, which can represent a 30–40% decrease in the free water body depending on the intensity of the summer drought, during which water remains only in the most distal area of the lagoon.The dune and sand area also experience strong variations, going from a 12% occupation in 1989 to their almost complete disappearance in the last study years. The area covered by the dune environment was increasingly occupied by the community composed of Scirpus maritimus and several species in the genus Juncus, whose area increased from 24% in 1956 to 31% in 1989. From that year onwards, its proportion has remained stable at around 30%. Finally, an expansion of the Phragmites australis community has also been detected during the 2010–2017 period, reaching 53% of the total area, while in 1989 it represented only 41%.", 3.

818," 3.2.1. Physicochemical Characterization and Composition of WaterWater pH ranged from slightly acidic values in the Xuño lagoon (6.1–7.3) to alkaline values in the Louro lagoon (7.8–9.8; Table 1). The extremely high values observed in the Louro lagoon are related to the increase in photosynthetic activity during the summer. Redox potential ranged between 213–485 mV, with both maximum and minimum values corresponding to the Xuño lagoon. The lowest values were found in late summer, when the free water volume is very small and organic load is high [22].The main difference in water composition was observed for parameters related to ion concentration. Thus, salinity, electrical conductivity, and chlorides showed their highest values in the Louro lagoon, followed by Vixán and Xuño. The low salinity (<1‰), electrical conductivity (0.27–0.88 dS m−1), and chloride concentration (47–228 mg L−1) of water in the Xuño lagoon is evidence to its continental origin, while the high conductivity and salinity of the water in the Vixán and Louro lagoons are characteristic of brackish waters and indicate a clear marine influence.Nutrient concentration in the water (NH4+, NO3−, and PO43−) showed abnormally high values in the three lagoons (Table 1), but particularly in the Vixán and Xuño lagoons in late summer.

819,"Water pH ranged from slightly acidic values in the Xuño lagoon (6.1–7.3) to alkaline values in the Louro lagoon (7.8–9.8; Table 1). The extremely high values observed in the Louro lagoon are related to the increase in photosynthetic activity during the summer. Redox potential ranged between 213–485 mV, with both maximum and minimum values corresponding to the Xuño lagoon. The lowest values were found in late summer, when the free water volume is very small and organic load is high [22].The main difference in water composition was observed for parameters related to ion concentration. Thus, salinity, electrical conductivity, and chlorides showed their highest values in the Louro lagoon, followed by Vixán and Xuño. The low salinity (<1‰), electrical conductivity (0.27–0.88 dS m−1), and chloride concentration (47–228 mg L−1) of water in the Xuño lagoon is evidence to its continental origin, while the high conductivity and salinity of the water in the Vixán and Louro lagoons are characteristic of brackish waters and indicate a clear marine influence.Nutrient concentration in the water (NH4+, NO3−, and PO43−) showed abnormally high values in the three lagoons (Table 1), but particularly in the Vixán and Xuño lagoons in late summer.

821,"The Habitats Directive (more formally known as Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora) establishes the types of habitats of community interest that must be protected by the European Union member states. Among them are coastal lagoons (habitat code 1150). According to the Interpretation Manual of European Union Habitats (2003), “lagoons are expanses of shallow coastal salt-water, of varying salinity and water volume, wholly or partially separated from the sea by sand banks or shingle, or, less frequently, by rocks. Salinity may vary from brackish water to hypersalinity depending on rainfall, evaporation and through the addition of fresh seawater from storms, temporary flooding of the sea in winter or tidal exchange”. The results regarding water and sediment composition in the three lagoons indicate that Louro and Vixán clearly fulfill the requirement of being a saline or brackish environment (Table 1; Figure 5). However, the so-called Xuño “lagoon” is, and has always been, a freshwater lake with no direct connection with the sea. Therefore, its current classification within habitat 1150 (“Coastal lagoons”) by the environmental authorities of the regional government (Xunta de Galicia) is incorrect, and it should be assigned to the category “Natural eutrophic lakes with Magnopotamion or Hydrocharition-type vegetation” (habitat code 3150). However, this is not an isolated case. Other lagoons in the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula, such as the Doniños and Traba lakes (both included in the Spanish Natura 2000 network), were also classified as coastal lagoons, but have recently been considered as coastal back-barrier perched lakes [15,24]. This typology is defined as freshwater bodies that are elevated over sea-level and are not directly subjected to the inflow of seawater, a definition that fits the characteristics of the Xuño lake.Ultimately, lagoon classification is not always easy and clear, and neither is their categorization as listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive, which mixed multidisciplinary information and used various environmental proxies in the majority of cases (see e.g., [15,24,25]).", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Types of Lagoons According to Their Location and Geochemistry (Coastal Lagoons and Natural Eutrophic Lakes),4
822,"The studied lagoons and lake represent different scenarios in terms of hydrologic dynamics and vegetation-covered area. In all of them, an increase in macrophyte coverage at the expense of the free water body was observed. The three lagoons are experiencing a progressive siltation and eutrophication process, which alters their natural evolution, and which could eventually affect the natural values inherent to these lagoons. It is worth highlighting the loss of habitat quality to host stable populations of aquatic birds (e.g., diving Anatidae, Fulicula atra, Tachybaptus ruficollis) and marsh birds (especially Emberiza schoeniclus and Circus aeruginosus) inhabiting these lagoons.Siltation and eutrophication are caused by several factors. The first one of them is the abandonment of traditional practices such as the annual harvesting of aerial biomass produced by macrophytes (mainly Pragmites australis, Scirpus maritimus, and Juncus maritimus) for cattle bedding. Systematic macrophyte harvesting reduced siltation and eutrophication of the lagoons [26]. These species are excellent nutrient extractors [27,28]. Other elements worth mentioning are changes in land use around the lagoons which have taken place in recent decades. During the 1960s and 1970s, areas surrounding the lagoons were consistently used for crop growing throughout the year (Figure 3). However, since the last decades of the 20th century, this activity was progressively abandoned, leading to the rapid regeneration of riparian forests composed mainly of common alder (Alnus glutinosa) and willow (Salix atrocinerea). The expansion of tree-covered areas around the lagoons led to a decrease in water availability due to the large water volume extracted from the ground by these species due to evapotranspiration [29]. Finally, siltation has also been compounded by sediment contributions due to recurrent forest fires within the drainage basin of the lagoons, particularly in the Louro and Vixán areas.The evolution of coastal lagoons does not represent a problem in the Galician context. In recent years, numerous studies have analyzed variations and their implications in the characteristics of lagoons, focusing on issues such as eutrophication. Clear examples of study cases are the analyses performed in the south of Spain [30,31,32], although diverse authors have studied other areas in the Iberian Peninsula [33] and the United Kingdom [34].", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Evolution and Environmental Implications of the Reduction in the Free Water Body and of Changes in the Areas Colonized by Vegetation,4
823,"The following main conclusions can be drawn from this study:The three lagoons are experiencing a progressive siltation and eutrophication process, which decreases water quality and substantially deteriorates their environmental function. The progressively increasing coverage by macrophytic communities at the expense of the area covered by free water body and quality is compromising the lagoons’ capacity to host stable populations of aquatic and marsh bird species.An adequate management of these spaces requires, first and foremost, a thorough understanding of their origin and dynamics. Knowledge of these aspects is currently incomplete, which has led to their incorrect classification in terms of habitat type, according to directive 92/43/CEE.The allocation of lagoons and lakes to the categories listed in Annex I of the Habitats Directive is very complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
824,"Rapid urbanization tends to increase urban temperature, carbon dioxide (CO2) emission, and ozone levels, which make urban areas warmer than rural areas [1]. CO2 is the dominant greenhouse gas [2]. Fuel combustion, air pollution, decreasing urban green land, and some other factors lead to higher temperatures and more CO2 in cities. Urban forests play an essential role in urban environment and street trees are an important part of urban forests [3]. Trees can fix carbon through photosynthesis and help decrease levels of atmospheric CO2 [2]. In addition, shading and transpiration of street trees can reduce high urban temperatures and improve the thermal comfort for humans [1,4]. Atmospheric particle pollution has become a serious health issue globally, and PM2.5, fine particles with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less, is one of the main atmospheric pollutants. Urban vegetation has the ability to take in the pollutants. Compared with shorter vegetation, trees can capture fine particles more effectively, and thus improve air quality in urban areas [3,5,6,7,8,9]. Better air quality and local climates can provide a more comfortable residential environment, and the visual effects of street trees will affect people’s perception of the environment [10]. Apart from the above benefits, street trees have some other instrumental functions, such as noise pollution mitigation [10], aesthetic improvement [3,6,7,8,9], urban biodiversity conservation, human health improvement [8,9], building energy reduction [4], and surface water runoff reduction [5,7].Street trees are integral to urban forests, and they are able to provide ecosystem services for urban ecosystems. In order to understand the functions that urban forests (including street trees) provide, several specific quantified values are used to assess these functions. Dobbs et al. [11] integrated some indicators (CO2 sequestration by trees, air pollutants removal, tree structure, crown dieback) into a framework to monitor the functions of urban forests. Moreover, many studies and researches have been conducted to assess the urban ecosystem services, including air pollutants removal [12,13,14,15], carbon storage and sequestration [14,16,17], and climate change mitigation and adaptation [16]. Urban Forest Effects (UFORE) model, which is developed by United States Department of Agriculture, can help assess the urban forest structure and its functions [18], and the model has been integrated into a software application, i.e., i-Tree Eco, to make assessments more convenient. Nowak et al. [13] combined i-Tree Eco model and field data on trees to determine the leaf surface area within 10 U.S. cities, and help evaluate the amount of PM2.5 removed by urban trees. Apart from the U.S., the i-Tree Eco model can be applied in other countries as well. For instance, Kiss et al. [14] used the model to evaluate carbon sequestration and air pollution removal based on the ecological processes of street and park trees in Szeged city, and Selmi et al. [15] quantified the air pollution removal by urban trees in Strasbourg city by utilizing the i-Tree Eco model. Referring to other tools and methods is another option to assess some functions. Chen et al. [12] used the atmospheric particle sampler TH-3150 and the gravimetric method to measure PM10 concentrations, and evaluated the efficiency of greenbelts in removing PM10 by comparing the PM10 concentrations at non-greenbelts and behind the greenbelts. Nowak et al. [17] utilized biomass equations to estimate carbon storage of different kinds of urban trees. Carbon sequestration estimation needs the additional measured tree growth rates. Biomass directly relates to the tree structure, including tree height and diameter at breast [19], which is critical to evaluating the ecosystem services of both natural forests and urban forests. Additionally, biomass is essential for carbon stock estimate [20], and thus biomass quantification is of great help to evaluate carbon sequestration. Acquiring biomass measurements with high accuracy usually requires analyzing trees in a destructive way, which is labor- and time-intensive [21]. LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging), also called laser scanning, is a method that can acquire 3D information of objects through a LiDAR system, which consists of laser scanners, global positioning system (GPS), and inertial measurement unit (IMU). According to the platforms that laser scanning systems are mounted on, they can be categorized as airborne laser scanning (ALS), terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), and mobile laser scanning (MLS). ALS has laser scanning systems mounted on aircrafts, such as planes and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Platforms for TLS are tripods, which are immobile during data acquisition process. For MLS, laser scanning systems are usually mounted on moving vehicles, including cars and trucks [22]. Laser scanning provide a non-destructive way to quantify biomass, which can replace the costly methods based on field measurements [23]. ALS and TLS have been widely applied to forestry, including tree canopy structure characterization, aboveground forest biomass estimation, structural parameters measurements, forest structural attributes and carbon stock estimation [21,23,24,25,26,27,28]. Biomass estimation of vegetation is a common application of laser scanning. Greaves et al. [21] estimated biomass of two shrub species, dwarf birch and diamond-leaf willow, in Arctic tundra by using TLS data. Ene et al. [27] combined various sampling strategies and ALS measurements to estimate aboveground biomass (AGB) in miombo woodlands. Moreover, laser scanning is applied not only at plot level, but also at individual tree level. For example, Kankare et al. [29] developed models which are based on TLS data to estimate AGB of individual trees, and AGB estimation accuracies were improved when comparing with existing models. Laser scanning data can also be applied to evaluate carbon stocks in forests. Coomes et al. [26] compared the results of two different forest carbon mapping methods, an area-based method and a tree-centric method, by using the ALS point clouds. Above studies indicate that current applications of laser scanning mainly focus on natural forests, and few researches have been conducted for urban forests, especially for street trees.ALS and TLS can be applied to different situations because of their own features. TLS is an efficient choice for acquiring accurate field data and is able to measure all important tree parameters [29]. TLS is more likely to carry out investigations at individual tree level. When trees in different plots need to be surveyed, TLS may suffer from laborious relocations [30]. As for ALS, it has relatively low point density that cannot depict canopy structure precisely, and thus ALS is usually utilized for plot level estimations of tree characteristics [30,31]. Unlike ALS and TLS, MLS is seldom used for forestry applications. MLS can hardly move in natural forests, but it has incomparable superiority in urban applications, particularly in road inventory investigation [31]. MLS systems are more efficient than TLS systems and MLS data have higher point density than ALS data. The information of street trees can be recorded easily and comprehensively with MLS systems moving along the streets.The objective of this study was to evaluate carbon sequestration and PM2.5 removal by using MLS data and meteorological data, including wind speed and local PM2.5 concentrations. We investigated (1) the method of extracting point cloud data of individual trees from raw MLS data; (2) the approach to measure tree morphological parameters, including tree height, crown width, and diameter at breast height, with the point clouds of individual trees; (3) the evaluation of carbon sequestration and PM2.5 removal for various tree species based on the measured parameters and ecological models. According to the results, we also compared the ability of several tree species to sequester carbon and intercept PM2.5.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
825,"Field data and MLS data were collected for three streets, namely Bihua Street, Taihu Street, and Shuangxia Street, in Nantong city (32°4′24″ N, 121°5′27″ E), which are located in the southeast of Jiangsu province (Figure 1). Nantong has a temperate climate and mean precipitation in this city is approximately 1040 mm, and annual mean temperature in Nantong is around 15.1 °C. Nantong has various species of street trees, including Platanus acerifolia, Cinnamomum camphor (L.) Presl and Sapindus mukurossi Gaertn. The investigated streets have four different tree species. Street trees of Bihua Street are Platanus acerifolia and Cinnamomum camphor (L.) Presl, and street trees of Taihu Street and Shuangxia Street are Sapindus mukurossi Gaertn and Acer mono Maxim. respectively.", 2. Materials, 2.1. Study Area,2
826,"MLS data of the three streets were collected in May 2015, while field data of these streets were collected in July 2015. Specific information of street trees, including tree species, DBH, tree height, crown width, and precise position, were obtained during field data acquiring process. Point cloud data were collected by a HiScan-Z mobile laser scanning system (hereafter referred to as the “MLS”, Figure 2, Table 1), which is produced by Hi-Cloud Company, with high precision. MLS scans were performed when the system moved along the streets. Objects, such as buildings, trees, street lamps, and road signs, were scanned and their detailed information was recorded.", 2. Materials, 2.2. Data Collection and MLS System,2
827,"A range of methods have been applied to detect individual trees in both natural forests and urban forests with point cloud data. Some of these methods choose not to process point cloud data directly, and use other LiDAR-derived data instead, such as Canopy Height Model (CHM), to extract single trees [32]. In recent years, methods [33,34,35] for extracting urban objects based on MLS data have developed rapidly. In this paper, we presented a simpler method (Figure 4) that used point cloud vertical characteristics and unique structural features of trees to extract individual street trees. 3.1.1. MLS Data PreprocessingWhen we obtained raw MLS data, some preprocessing measures were taken. First of all, ground points and non-ground points were separated by utilizing the Cloth Simulation Filter (CSF), which is proposed by Zhang et al. [36]. The CSF algorithm assumes that there is a cloth covering the inverted point clouds, and the cloth would become an approximation of the ground surface. Ground points in point clouds can be extracted by comparing the generated cloth surface and the original LiDAR points. Then, noise and outlier points were removed by noise filter and Statistical Outlier Removal (SOR) filter. The SOR filter conducts statistical analysis for points in point clouds. For each point, the SOR filter computes the average distance to its neighbors, and if the distance is not within a certain range, the point will be regarded as an outlier and be removed from point clouds. When the above two procedures finished, the continuity of objects was broken and noise points were removed. 3.1.2. Point Clouds Coarse ClassificationAfter MLS data were preprocessed, the remaining points could be categorized as buildings, vegetation, road facilities, and some other ground objects. Generally, objects in these categories have different average heights. Vegetation that close to ground, such as shrubs or grass, are usually the lowest ground objects, street lamps and street trees have medium height, and buildings have the largest average height (Figure 5). Coarse point cloud classification was conducted based on this perception, and coarse classification could eliminate points of ground objects whose heights were higher or lower than street trees. Algorithm 1 presents the process of point clouds coarse classification.Algorithm 1. Point clouds coarse classification algorithmInput: Filtered MLS point clouds P1 = {(Xi, Yi, Zi)|i = 1, 2, …, n, n is the number of points}Output: Point clouds with classification information P2 = {(Xi, Yi, Zi, cj)|i = 1, 2, …, n, n is the number of points; cj is class number, j = 1, 2, …, m, m is the number of classes}1. Set cubic square grids for points and put points into corresponding grids (Figure 6). The size of grid is set as l m × l m × h m, and the value of l is set manually while the value of h is determined according to Equation (1).2. Stratify points in each grid into layers with a proper spacing (S) (Equation (2), Figure 6) and calculate the average height of points in each layer (Equation (3)). Generally, S can be different for various situations, but it cannot be overly large or small. For most situations, 1m is a proper value for S.3. Construct an m × n (m is the number of grids, n is the number of layers in each grid (Equation (4))) matrix and each n × 1 vector represents the average heights array of the corresponding grid (Figure 6).4. Utilize Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensions of the matrix and get the matrix’s dominant features.5. Use K-means algorithm to complete the classification of the vectors, and points that correspond to vectors, would also find their class. Add classification number, cj, for each point.6. Return: P2.

The class that contained street trees would be processed in the next procedure. 3.1.3. Individual Street Trees ExtractionSince point cloud data became disconnected point blocks, points could cluster into independent ground objects based on spatial relations between points. Individual street trees could be extracted by selecting point clusters that had specific features.The class which contained street trees was selected, and regular cubic square grids were set for this class with a smaller grid spacing, 0.2 m × 0.2 m. The number of points in each grid was counted. According to the fact that whether the grid had points, we generated a table with nx × ny cells (nx is the number of rows, ny is the number of columns). If one grid had points, the value of its corresponding cell would be set as the number of points, otherwise the value would be set as zero (Figure 7).

Then, the table was divided into different parts by using a two-dimensional region growing algorithm (Algorithm 2, Figure 8). In Algorithm 2, Pseed is a set that reserves seed cells.Algorithm 2.

Put the cell into Pseed.2. Select a cell from Pseed, Si, mark the cell and erase it from Pseed.3. Search four adjacent cells (in order of up, down, left and right) around Si. If adjacent cells were valid, these cells would be put into Pseed.4. Loop process 2 to 3 until Pseed is empty, and marked cells would cluster into one part.5. Go back to process 1 to find a new seed cell, and conduct process 2 to 4 sequentially until all valid cells are marked.6. Return: Tb.When valid cells find the part that they belong to, their corresponding grids and points in these grids would also cluster into different parts.When point cloud data were divided into several point clusters, individual street trees could be extracted from these clusters based on some features. Four features were selected to find out point clusters of street trees:(1) ΔZ: The difference between the maximum and the minimum Z coordinates (Equation (5)) of the point cluster.

(3) PA: The projected area of a point cluster. Each horizontally projected point cloud cluster is segmented into several grids with a small grid spacing, 0.3 m, and the number of point-occupied grids are regarded as the PA of the cluster.(4) d: The distance from the point cluster to the central line of the street (Figure 9).Values of ΔZ, ΔX/ΔY, PA, and d of all point clusters would be calculated, and constraints of these values would be set (Table 2). The ΔZ threshold was set as 1.3 m because heights of most street trees were above 1.3 m. Given that point clouds of street trees were not complete and the integrity of tree crowns was damaged, ΔX/ΔY was set between 0.5 and 1.5 to avoid omitting some trees. PA of street trees varied and it was hard to choose proper thresholds. In this case, several experiments were conducted before determining thresholds of PA, and the final minimum threshold and maximum threshold were 60 and 300. Distances from street trees to street central line were restricted between (SW/2-1) m to (SW/2+1) m to provide buffer for the distances. When point clusters can satisfy all constraints, these point clusters would be eventually extracted as street trees.", 3. Methods, 3.1. Individual Street Trees Point Clouds Extraction,3

Put the cell into Pseed.2. Select a cell from Pseed, Si, mark the cell and erase it from Pseed.3. Search four adjacent cells (in order of up, down, left and right) around Si. If adjacent cells were valid, these cells would be put into Pseed.4. Loop process 2 to 3 until Pseed is empty, and marked cells would cluster into one part.5. Go back to process 1 to find a new seed cell, and conduct process 2 to 4 sequentially until all valid cells are marked.6. Return: Tb.When valid cells find the part that they belong to, their corresponding grids and points in these grids would also cluster into different parts.When point cloud data were divided into several point clusters, individual street trees could be extracted from these clusters based on some features. Four features were selected to find out point clusters of street trees:(1) ΔZ: The difference between the maximum and the minimum Z coordinates (Equation (5)) of the point cluster.

(3) PA: The projected area of a point cluster. Each horizontally projected point cloud cluster is segmented into several grids with a small grid spacing, 0.3 m, and the number of point-occupied grids are regarded as the PA of the cluster.(4) d: The distance from the point cluster to the central line of the street (Figure 9).Values of ΔZ, ΔX/ΔY, PA, and d of all point clusters would be calculated, and constraints of these values would be set (Table 2). The ΔZ threshold was set as 1.3 m because heights of most street trees were above 1.3 m. Given that point clouds of street trees were not complete and the integrity of tree crowns was damaged, ΔX/ΔY was set between 0.5 and 1.5 to avoid omitting some trees. PA of street trees varied and it was hard to choose proper thresholds. In this case, several experiments were conducted before determining thresholds of PA, and the final minimum threshold and maximum threshold were 60 and 300. Distances from street trees to street central line were restricted between (SW/2-1) m to (SW/2+1) m to provide buffer for the distances. When point clusters can satisfy all constraints, these point clusters would be eventually extracted as street trees.", 3. Methods, 3.1.3. Individual Street Trees Extraction,3
831,"The application of laser scanning technology can acquire precise information of urban trees rapidly and reduce the workload for urban forest workers. Various algorithms [34,37,38] for measuring morphological parameters with different kinds of laser scanning data, including ALS data, TLS data, and MLS data, have been studied. In this study, we primarily measured three morphological parameters of trees, including tree height, crown width, and DBH. To make the measuring process more specific, points of crown and trunk were separated. 3.2.1. Tree Height MeasurementTree height measuring method was conducted with following steps:Step 1: Project trunk points onto the XOY plane, and fit these projected points with a circle [39], whose center is (X0, Y0).Step 2: Construct a square that regards (X0, Y0) as its center. The length and width of the square are set as 1.5 m to contain points around the trunk.Step 3: Find projected points that are in the square, namely their coordinates (X, Y) satisfy Expression (7), and extract their corresponding 3D points.

DBH MeasurementFor trees with different point density, two DBH measuring methods were introduced in this study:(1) For trees with relatively high point density, trunk points between 1.2 m to 1.4 m off the ground are extracted and a circle is fitted for these points. The diameter of the circle is regarded as DBH.(2) For trees whose trunk points at breast height are sparse and cannot depict the profile of the trunk, all trunk points are employed to measure DBH. Trunk points are segmented vertically with a proper spacing, 0.2 m to 0.4 m. Points in each segment would be projected onto the horizontal plane and a fitted circle would be formed for the points in the segment.

835,"Biomass of each street tree can be calculated by using allometric equations, and whole tree dry weight biomass and carbon storage can be estimated with conversion factors [17]. Thus, before estimating carbon storage of street trees, their biomass needs to be calculated first, and tree height and DBH are applied in allometric equations to estimate biomass. Annual carbon sequestration of street trees is the difference of their carbon storage between year x and year (x+1). So, tree height growth and DBH growth in a year would be predicted before estimating carbon sequestration [17]. In this research, the i-Tree Eco model was employed to calculate carbon sequestration. Essential information of street trees was imported to i-Tree Eco software, and detailed calculating results, including leaf area, carbon storage, and annual gross carbon sequestration, of each street tree were obtained.", 3.

Leaf area [41] is calculated by using the i-Tree Eco model, and PM2.5 concentration data and daily purifying hours can be obtained by visiting the meteorological website. Apart from these data, the deposition velocity of PM2.5 to the leaf surface ought to be determined. The deposition velocity is determined by experiments instead of experiential research, and because of the restricted experimental conditions, we referred to some references to find corresponding deposition velocities of PM2.5 for different tree species. Table 3 [13,40] presents deposition velocities of several tree species at different wind speeds. Deposition velocities for four tree species in our research could not be found in the references, so deposition velocities of Cinnamomum camphor (L.) Presl and Acer mono Maxim. were replaced by average deposition velocities of evergreen broadleaved trees and deposition velocities of Acer pseudoplatanus, respectively, and deposition velocities of Sapindus mukurossi Gaertn and Platanus acerifolia were replaced by average deposition velocities of deciduous broadleaved trees.", 3.

837,"During MLS data acquiring process, data of three streets were collected separately, thus street trees extraction for streets were performed individually.Before conducting coarse classification, the square grid size and the layer spacing needed to be determined. In order to find appropriate grid size, layer spacing, and the number of classes, we attempted different combinations of these three parameters. Final combinations for the three streets were shown in Table 4. Bihua Street and Shuangxia Street had the same grid size and layer spacing, while these two parameters of Taihu Street were slightly larger. The final grid sizes, 4 m × 4 m and 5 m × 5 m, were close to the sizes of street trees’ crowns. By observing ground objects on the three streets, we found that there was no building on Shuangxia Street, and buildings on Taihu Street were higher than buildings on Bihua Street. In addition, Taihu Street had more abundant variety of ground objects than other two streets. Therefore, Taihu Street needed a lager layer spacing (2 m), and more classes (4 classes). With the final parameters setting, most street trees were classified into the same class. Then, points in the class, which contained street trees, were allocated to different point clusters. When a point cluster met all requirements presented in Table 2, the point cluster would be extracted as a street tree.Results of street trees extraction are presented in Table 5. Extraction completeness rates for Bihua Street, Shuangxia Street, and Taihu Street were 97.9%, 98.4%, and 100% respectively, and correctness rates for these three streets were 92%, 98.4%, and 93.2% respectively. Figure 11 showed false extraction results by using the proposed algorithm, including false positives and false negatives. Some street lamps and road signs, whose point clouds mixed with street trees, were extracted as street trees. Trees with lower tree heights and smaller crown widths were omitted by the algorithm.

838,"In total, there were 148 street trees extracted from MLS data. Some street trees were not in study area and field data of these trees were not collected, so we excluded these trees and extracted the omitted street trees manually. Eventually, morphological parameters for 143 street trees were measured. The number of street trees on Bihua Street, Shuangxia Street, and Taihu Street was 41, 62, and 40, respectively.For street trees on each street, RMSE (Root Mean Square Errors) and mean errors of the three morphological parameters were calculated (Table 6). Parameters of street trees on Taihu Street had the largest RMSE of tree height and crown width, while the RMSE of DBH was the smallest. Street trees on Bihua Street had the smallest RMSE of crown width measurements and the largest RMSE of DBH measurements. RMSE of tree height measurements for street trees on Shuangxia Street was the smallest. Although RMSE of morphological parameters measurements for trees on the three streets differed, the differences were minor. Values of mean errors of these parameters’ measurements indicated that morphological parameters derived from MLS data were mostly underestimated.To understand the relevance between MLS-derived parameters and field measured parameters, scatter plots were created for the three parameters (Figure 13). R2 values for tree height and crown width are 0.99 and 0.80, respectively, while R2 for DBH is 0.52. Due to the issue of tree trunks point density, measurements of DBH is more difficult and complicated, and MLS-derived DBH is less correlated with field measured DBH. Tree heights of street trees ranging from 4 m to 10 m, and this parameter showed a better agreement between MLS-derived results and field measured results than the other two parameters. Trees on Shuangxia Street had larger tree heights than trees on Bihua Street and Taihu Street. Crown widths were between 1.5 m and 5 m, and street trees on Taihu Street had larger average crown width. As for DBH, most street trees had DBH ranging from 7.5 cm to 20 cm, only a tree on Bihua Street had DBH approximated to 25 cm. Overall, morphological parameters derived from MLS data had relatively high accuracy.", 4. Results, 4.2. Morphological Parameters Measurements,4
839,"Measured morphological parameters of each street tree were imported to the i-Tree Eco model to estimate carbon sequestration and PM2.5 removal.Annual carbon sequestration (Figure 14a) could be obtained directly from reports that generated from i-Tree Eco software. Carbon sequestration of street trees ranged from 1.2 kg/year to 5.2 kg/year. Cinnamomum camphor (L.) Presl trees on Bihua Street had the largest annual carbon sequestration. Several Acer mono Maxim. trees on Shuangxia Street and Sapindus mukurossi Gaertn trees on Taihu Street had relatively large annual carbon sequestration, while the rest of Acer mono Maxim. trees, Sapindus mukurossi Gaertn trees and a Platanus acerifolia tree on Bihua Street had less annual carbon sequestration.As for PM2.5 removal (Figure 14b), we collected meteorological data, including PM2.5 concentrations and wind speeds (Table 7), in April 2015 of Nantong. There were 10 rainy days in April 2015 and these days were excluded in our research, so the total purifying time was 20 days. PM2.5 removed by street trees in April 2015 ranged from 2 g to 43 g. Sapindus mukurossi Gaertn trees on Taihu Street and the Platanus acerifolia tree on Bihua Street had large PM2.5 removal, while Cinnamomum camphor (L.) Presl trees on Bihua Street had less PM2.5 removal. The amount of PM2.5 that removed by Acer mono Maxim. trees was between the amount of PM2.5 removed by Sapindus mukurossi Gaertn trees and Cinnamomum camphor (L.) Presl trees. The distribution of PM2.5 removal was significantly different from the distribution of annual carbon sequestration.", 4. Results, 4.3. Carbon Sequestration and PM2.5 Removal Estimation,4
840,"To complete street trees extraction, point clouds coarse classification and extracting individual street trees based on feature constraints need to be accomplished.For coarse classification, setting the grid size and the layer spacing is a critical step, because these two parameters have direct influences on classification results. Several combinations of these two parameters were employed to obtain satisfactory coarse classification results. However, regular grids sometimes cannot obtain integral trees and this problem would generate some errors when measuring morphological parameters of trees. When extracting individual street trees, four feature constraints, including three morphological feature constraints (ΔZ, ΔX/ΔY, PA) and a positional feature constraint (d), are proposed. Morphological features of point clusters can assist to depict the shapes of trees. Constraining the morphological features can exclude some ground objects whose morphological features do not match to trees, such as walls, street lamps, and road signs. The positional feature constraint, d, is restricted to about half of the street width (SW) to help eliminate trees that are not street trees. Most street trees on the three streets were successfully extracted based on coarse classification and feature constraints. Nevertheless, some trees were omitted and a few street lamps and road signs were difficult to remove. As the coarse classification is conducted based on average heights of ground objects, trees whose height were much lower or higher than the average height of all trees may be omitted. If street trees had irregular shapes or small crowns so that they could not satisfy feature constraints, these trees were omitted as well. Street lamps and road signs, whose point clouds mixed with street trees, could be hard to distinguish from street trees, and the proposed method could not deal with the situation at present. Our method needs to be improved to separate mixed point clouds. Currently, many methods consider using 3D voxels and spatial region growing algorithms [34,35,42] to obtain point clouds of street objects from MLS data, including street trees, more accurately. This kind of method can acquire more accurate extraction results, but also requires lots of computing resources. Moreover, Tao et al. [43] introduced the comparative shortest-path algorithm (CSP) which utilized metabolic ecology theories to segment tree crowns. Utilizing ecological theories to segment trees is considerably novel and can make use of ecological features of trees. Lehtomäki et al. [44] proposed a machine-learning-based method to complete street objects classification. Completeness and correctness of street objects classification and extraction are improved attributing to the method. Our method can extract street trees correctly and efficiently for simple street environment. However, the proposed method needs to be improved for more complicated street environments. In future work, more features of point clusters, such as point density and point distribution, can be used to distinguish street trees, and machine learning and deep learning algorithms can be introduced in our study to acquire more precise classification results.

841,"Morphological parameters of street trees measured in this study included tree height, crown width and diameter at breast height, which provide fundamental information about street trees.The tree height measuring method utilizes the growing characteristic of trees and the results are of high precision. For crown width and DBH, point density is a vital factor that influenced the measuring methods for these two parameters. For street trees, points of tree crowns distribute unevenly, the part of tree crowns that closed to streets has higher point density, and point clouds of tree trunks are not integral. Considering the issue of uneven point density, results generated from circle-fitting and ellipse-fitting methods sometimes are not convincible. Crown width and DBH measuring methods proposed in this paper considers the characteristics of tree crown point clouds and tree trunk point clouds. The crown width measuring method could help avoid underestimating or overestimating crown widths. As for DBH, we adopt two measuring approaches. Street trees on Shuangxia Street and Taihu Street were of high point density, so trunk points at breast height were extracted to measure DBH. Street width of Bihua Street was wider than street widths of other two streets, so the point density of street trees on Bihua Street was lower, and measuring DBH of street trees required all trunk points of these trees. The precision of measuring results in our study were close to the precision of measuring results in Wu et al. [34], and the proposed measuring methods performed well when compared with other measuring methods [43]. However, DBH plays a crucial role in estimating the ecological benefits of trees, and the result of DBH measurements is not precise enough, thus improving the DBH measuring method is necessary in future work.", 5.

842,"Remote sensing methods, especially the combination of images (aerial or satellite) and LiDAR data, have been applied to estimate biomass, carbon storage, and map structures of urban forests in many studies [45,46,47,48]. However, most of these researches utilized ALS data and TLS data, and researches about utilizing MLS data or MLS-derived parameters to estimate carbon sequestration and pollutants removal are not common. In this study, tree heights and DBH of street trees generated from MLS data and tree species were imported to i-Tree Eco model to estimate carbon sequestration and PM2.5 removal of these trees.When integral information are imported to i-Tree Eco model, carbon sequestration and leaf area can be obtained. According to the estimation results of each street tree, it is hard to conclude which trees species can bring greater ecological benefits for the urban environment. Carbon sequestration of trees is derived from tree biomass, and tree biomass is calculated based on allometric equations. The equations are distinct for different tree species. With respect to PM2.5 removal estimation, apart from leaf area, meteorological data and PM2.5 deposition velocities are also required, and deposition velocities vary considerably for different tree species. The decisive contributing factor that affects the estimation results of carbon sequestration and PM2.5 removal is tree species, which represents the natural properties of trees. For different tree species, tree height and DBH have limited influence on the estimation results of the two ecological benefits. While for the same tree species, the estimation results of carbon sequestration and PM2.5 would be mainly determined by tree height and DBH.Tree height, DBH, and tree species are fundamental information for evaluating ecological benefits. To obtain more precise estimation results, the i-Tree Eco model requires more detailed information about trees, such as height to crown base and height to live top. In addition, there are no PM2.5 monitoring stations in study area, so PM2.5 concentrations data in the study area were replaced by the PM2.5 concentrations in Nantong City, which were not precise enough. PM2.5 deposition velocities of some tree species are not measured, and they have to be substituted by deposition velocities of the same genus or deposition velocities of all broadleaf or conifer trees. The deficiency of PM2.5 concentration data and deposition velocity data would create inaccuracies of the results.Overall, estimation results of carbon sequestration and PM2.5 presented in this paper is crude because of limited data and the equations used in the i-Tree Eco model [46]. However, the two ecological benefits generated from different tree species and different trees of the same species can be observed, and thus help to select tree species or trees that are more beneficial to urban street environments.", 5. Discussion, 5.3. Carbon Sequestration and PM2.5 Removal Estimation,5
843,"This work has proven that using raw MLS data to obtain morphological information and evaluate ecological benefits of individual urban street trees rapidly is feasible. The accuracy and efficiency of street trees extraction are improved by utilizing the method proposed in our study. Morphological parameters of each street tree, including tree height, crown width and DBH, are measured, enabling us to evaluate the ecological benefits of each street tree. Carbon sequestration and PM2.5 removal of street trees can be obtained by importing the required information into the i-Tree Eco model. Our results suggest that ecological benefits are varied for different tree species, and for trees of the same species, ecological benefits are not the same. In order to obtain estimation results with higher accuracy, more sufficient and detailed data of street trees and the urban environment need to be collected. Additionally, understanding physiological characteristics of street trees can assist our understanding of the mechanism of ecological benefit generation, and physiological characteristics can be obtained with the help of spectral information. Therefore, in further study, spectral data of trees can be incorporated into research data to improve ecological benefits estimation results. Urban planners will be able to identify street trees that are more suitable for cities based on their ecological benefits.", 6. Conclusions,None,6
844,"Forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle, thus forest monitoring is critical to understanding and quantifying forest dynamics and the impact of climate change on forest ecosystems [1,2]. Alaska is the largest state in the USA and the boreal forests within the interior region of the state account for approximately 17% (520,000 km2) of the nation’s forestland. [3]. Interior Alaska is also warming faster than many places on Earth, with a mean annual temperature increase of 2.06 degrees Celsius between 1949–2016 [4,5]. Climate projections indicate continued increases in average annual temperature and precipitation in the coming years, with some models predicting up to five degrees Celsius increase in annual temperature and 50% increase in precipitation by 2080 [6]. These projected changes have potential impacts on livelihoods and resource management. Although much of interior Alaska’s forests are remote and inaccessible, many households within the rural communities of interior Alaska are dependent on the nearby forest resources for heat/energy, building materials, and wildlife habitat [7]. As a result, interior Alaska’s communities are interested in assessing the available supply of forest biomass in Alaska’s forests for use in the production of bioenergy [8]. In addition, understanding biomass and how it is distributed within different forest types in Alaska helps us to quantify and measure changes in boreal forests under climate change [9].The USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program provides vital information for assessing the status of forests in the United States. Prior to 2014, interior Alaska was not included in the FIA program due to the extreme remoteness and inaccessibility of the region. In 2014, a pilot project was established to begin the work of surveying interior Alaska, starting with the Tanana valley region of the state. This area included the Tanana Valley State Forest and Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge, which were sampled at a 1:4 intensity (or one plot per 97.12 km2, or 24,000 acres) on a hexagonal grid [10].While these new FIA plots were being established for the 2014 Tanana pilot project, high-resolution airborne remote sensing data were acquired by NASA Goddard’s Lidar, Hyperspectral and Thermal (G-LiHT) Airborne Imager to augment the relatively sparse sample of FIA field plots. This new suite of sensors developed by scientists at NASA maps the composition, structure, and function of terrestrial ecosystems with coincident, high (~1 m2) spatial resolution hyperspectral, thermal, and lidar data. [11]. Together, these multi-sensor data provide a novel opportunity to assess forest conditions in the areas covered by the G-LiHT swaths at the scale of individual tree crowns.One of the standard measures in the FIA plot protocol is the condition class within each plot. Forest type is a primary condition class attribute recorded at each plot and is defined as the species of tree with the dominant stocking of live trees that are not overtopped [12]. In Alaska this essentially records the dominant canopy tree species present at a given plot. If there are no trees present or if the trees do not meet a specific tree canopy cover threshold (10%), then the plot is considered non-forest [13]. These data provide a field reference for the distribution of different species throughout the forests. For species that frequently occur in mixed stands, the dominant species information is a categorical indicator of condition class, not a continuous measure of canopy cover by species. In combination with the G-LiHT data, condition class data for each plot location can be used to classify forest type throughout that Tanana valley of interior Alaska.In this study, we developed and applied a methodology for classifying FIA-defined forest type across the Tanana Inventory Unit (TIU) of interior Alaska using the fusion of G-LiHT hyperspectral and lidar data [10,11]. These structural and spectral data from G-LiHT, and the field data from the newly installed FIA plots, provide the information necessary to predict forest type within the TIU. We evaluated different classification algorithms and combinations of hyperspectral and lidar data to identify the model with the highest classification accuracy, and then applied the best model to G-LiHT data across the TIU to compare modeled versus observed forest type information from FIA forest inventory plots. Although interior Alaska has only six main canopy tree species, the combination of small crown sizes, open canopy structure, and mixed stands creates challenges for classifying forest type, even with high-resolution multi-sensor airborne data. Similar studies have used hyperspectral and lidar data to classify tree species with machine learning models [14,15], but none have used the combination to classify forest type, a unique metric in the USDA Forest Service FIA inventory. The potential to accurately classify forest type using airborne remote sensing data is important to support multi-level forest inventories as well as broader assessments in regions where FIA plots were not installed but hyperspectral and lidar data are available.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
845,"This study was conducted within the Tanana Inventory Unit (TIU) located within the Tanana Valley of Interior Alaska (Figure 1).The TIU covers 136,482 km2 and is dominated by six tree species: black spruce (Picea mariana), white spruce (Picea glauca), tamarack (also referred to as larch, Larix laricina), Alaska paper birch (Betula papyrifera var. neoalaskana), quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides), and balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera). Forests in the TIU often have open canopy structures that promote the establishment and growth of understory and ground cover vegetation, including shrubs such as dwarf birch (Betula spp.) and willow (Salix spp.) [16,17,18,19,20] (Figure 2).", 2.

846,"The modern FIA program implements a multi-phase sampling design. The first phase uses ancillary data, such as satellite or aerial imaging, to stratify the land area by cover type. The second phase is the installation and measurement of permanent ground plots, so long as any portion of the plots contain forest land. In the standard FIA inventory implemented in the lower 48 states, the plots are typically established based on a hexagonal tessellation of the landscape, with one ground plot randomly located in each 24.28 km2 (or 6000-acre) hexagon. The plots are laid out such that there is one central subplot, and 3 outer subplots that are each 36.576 m (120 ft) from center-to-center (Figure 3). The 2014 pilot project in the Tanana Valley of Interior Alaska implemented the same plot design within a sparser 97.12 km2 (24,000 acre) regular hexagon grid, due to the cost and accessibility issues associated with these plots [10]. At each subplot, forest type was measured by field crews who determined the dominant species present within each condition and recorded this as forest type. Only one forest type is assigned for each measured condition. This method is standard for all USDA FIA plots collected on public lands throughout the United States and thus could not be modified for the purposes of this study.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. FIA Field Data,2
847,"G-LiHT data were acquired in July–August 2014, coincident with the establishment of FIA plots. Airborne data were acquired as a systematic sample of strips, spaced every 9.2 km (Figure 1); additional flight lines were designed to acquire data over other research study sites. Lidar point clouds were processed to obtain digital terrain models (DTM) from the ground-classified points and canopy height models (CHM) from the highest point in each grid cell, each at 1-m resolution [21]. The DTM was processed to obtain topography metrics using the gdaldem function within the gdalUtils package in R [22], including slope, aspect, topographic roughness index (TRI), topographic position index (TPI), and roughness [23]. The CHM was processed to obtain canopy metrics using the GridSurfaceStats command line utility in FUSION [21]. This resulted in metrics for max height, potential volume, surface area ratio, surface volume, and surface volume ratio. All DTM and CHM metrics were averaged over each circular subplot (7.3 m radius) (Figure 3).The G-LiHT hyperspectral data were radiometrically calibrated [11] and converted to at-sensor reflectance for 114 bands approximately equally spaced between 418 and 918 nm at 1 m spatial resolution. The hyperspectral data were further processed in R to obtain a variety of hyperspectral vegetation indices, each of which describe a different and unique spectral characteristic of vegetation. In total, 27 metrics were tested to capture the unique characteristics of each forest type. When aggregating the hyperspectral indices, shadow pixels were eliminated by removing pixels that fell into the lower 10% quantile in three indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), photochemical reflectance index (PRI), or Red Edge normalized difference vegetation index (RENDVI) [24,25]. These shadow pixels were removed in all vegetation indices before averaging over each circular subplot.Nine hyperspectral vegetation indices were calculated to estimate vegetation structure (Table 1): Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), NDVI Inverse Simple Ratio (ISR NDVI), NDRE Inverse Simple Ratio (ISR NDRE), Normalized Difference in Red Edge (NDRE), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Simple Ratio (SR), Simple Ratio Red Edge (SR Red Edge), Visible Atmospheric Resistant Index (VARI), and the Green Vegetation Index (VI green).Six hyperspectral indices were calculated to characterize biochemical pigments in vegetation (Table 2): Pigment Specific Normalized Difference (PSND a and b), Plant Senescence Reflectance Index (PSRI), Pigment Specific Simple Ratio (PSSR a and b), and Structure Insensitive Pigment Index (SIPI).In addition, six chlorophyll-specific indices were calculated from the 1 m hyperspectral data (Table 3): Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio (CARI), Chlorophyll Index Red-Edge (CI Red Edge), Carter and Miller index (CSM), Carter and Miller red-edge index (CSM Red Edge), Datt Index (Datt), and Modified Chlorophyll Absorption Ratio (MCARI).Finally, six indices were calculated to evaluate anthocyanin (Table 4) and carotenoid (Table 5) pigment content: Anthocyanin Content Index (ACI), Anthocynanin Reflectance Index (ARI), Modified Anthocynanin Reflectance Index (mARI), Red/Green Ratio Index (RGRI), and two Carotenoid Reflectance Indices (CRI1, CRI2).Carotenoid Reflectance Index (CRI 1 and 2) describe carotenoid content (Table 5).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. G-LiHT Data,2
848,"In total, 632 FIA subplots were covered by the G-LiHT data used in this study. The nested subplot design of FIA plots leads to an issue of pseudo replication. Subplots that lie within the same plot are only 36.576 m (120 ft) from one another, and thus are more likely to be spectrally and texturally similar to each other when compared to plots in different parts of the forest, based on spatial autocorrelation in both forest and topographic characteristics (Figure 3). Consequently, the models are more likely to classify the forest types of these subplots correctly, even if they trained on a different subplot within the same plot. Despite issues of pseudo replication, all subplots were retained in to provide more complete coverage of forest types in the TIU (Table 6), given the small tree sizes and high degree of spatial heterogeneity in vegetation structure, topography, and moisture conditions in the TIU. The dataset itself is small because it was collected using the USDA Forest Service’s FIA methodology that was adapted for use in remote regions of Alaska. This methodology led to a relatively small dataset, making this an ideal case study for evaluating the feasibility of using remote sensing to fill in the gaps where field data could not.Most studies that focus on the FIA subplots overcome this issue of pseudoreplication by selecting only one subplot per plot and eliminating the remaining plots from the analysis [46,47]. Subsetting to a single subplot per plot in this study would result in an insufficiently representative sample of subplots for both training and validation (Table 6). Thus, all subplots were used in this analysis, but it must be recognized that pseudo replication is present. Until there are enough subplots of each forest type, this issue cannot be addressed further. This is an important tradeoff that comes with using a “real world” dataset rather than experimental study data collected specifically for use with remote sensing. Bootstrap aggregating, or bagging, was tested, but did not improve model performance [48].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Data Sub-Setting,2
849,"We tested five classification algorithms: Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC), and Multinomial Logistic Regression. These five algorithms were chosen because they are commonly used in ecological classification studies but have not been simultaneously compared in any other known ecological study. These were also readily available through packages in R, which is a widely used programming language in USDA Forest Service Research and Development. It should be noted that other languages such as MatLab and Python also offer packages to simultaneously compare Machine Learning algorithms.Random forest is a machine learning algorithm commonly used in ecological studies as it frequently outperforms other algorithms. Random Forest uses an ensemble of decision trees that are split at each node using a random subset of input predictors. This is repeated a set number of times and used to create models for prediction of classes [49,50]. Random forest is unique when compared to other classification algorithms because it estimates the importance of a predictor variable by determining how much the out of bag (OOB) error increases when data for that variable are permuted while others are left unchanged [49]. Of the multiple ways of measuring variable importance, we used mean decrease in accuracy to measure variable importance rather than mean decrease in Gini [51]. Support vector machines use hyperplanes in an n-dimensional space to separate and distinguish distinct classes in a dataset [52,53]. K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers find the k closest training vectors in Euclidean space to the validation set, and determine the class based on a majority vote of the k training vectors [54,55]. A naive Bayes classifier is a probability-based classifier that uses Bayes’ theorem and assumes conditional independence and a Gaussian distribution in the predictor metrics. The model computes the conditional posterior probability of the response and uses that to perform classifications [56,57,58,59]. Multinomial logistic regressions use a logistic regression to predict the probability of different classes given a set of independent predictor variables. In this study, all Multinomial Logistic Regression models were fit using neural networks [60].These five classification algorithms were tested to determine the best algorithm for classifying forest type from hyperspectral and lidar data. The overall and kappa prediction accuracies for each model were compared among models. Overall prediction accuracy is defined as the rate at which the model correctly predicts a given class, or forest type in this case. It is calculated by taking the sum of the total number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions made. Kappa accuracy, or the kappa coefficient of agreement, is a commonly used metric in remote sensing that accounts for the expected error rate. Kappa is calculated by subtracting the expected accuracy (E) from the observed accuracy (O), and dividing that by 1 minus the expected accuracy [61]:

(O − E)/(1 − E)


(1)

Though commonly used, the kappa statistic remains controversial in the field of remote sensing, which is why it was used in combination with overall accuracy in this study [62].When necessary, parameters within the models were tuned to improve accuracy (Table 7). In the case of Random Forest models, 5000 trees were used instead of the default 500 to boost model performance and obtain a more consistent estimation of variable importance between different model runs [51]. The final Random Forest model used 15,000 trees to ensure extremely stable estimates of variable importance [49,51]. When tuning the Support Vector Machine, a variety of tuning parameters were tested (cost values between 10−1 and 102 and gamma values of 0.5, 1, 2). The best parameters were selected from the tuning function and used in the final models with a radial kernel. In the K-Nearest Neighbor models, k values between 0 and 100 were tested to determine the k value that resulted in the highest prediction accuracy. This “best” k value was selected for each model using an optimization script. In the case of the Naive Bayes Classifier and Multinomial Logistic Regression models, all default parameters were used.We tested six combinations of predictor data with each classification algorithm to investigate the contributions from structural and spectral metrics to overall model accuracy. The predictor inputs can be summarized as four data types: raw hyperspectral bands, hyperspectral vegetation indices, DTM metrics, and CHM metrics. In the first predictor input group, all available data for the subplots were input into the model. This group was not tested in the Multinomial Logistic Regression models as there were too many predictor inputs. In the second predictor group, most of the raw hyperspectral bands (excluding one band each for red, green, blue, near infrared, and red edge) were removed and only the hyperspectral vegetation indices and the DTM and CHM metrics were included. The other four predictor groups consisted of inputs from a single predictor data group: all 114 raw hyperspectral bands, hyperspectral vegetation indices and 5 raw bands (one band each for red, green, blue, near infrared, and red edge; Table 8), DTM metrics, and CHM metrics.All available subplot data were used in a 3-fold cross validation to ensure that all data were included in both validation and training. K-fold cross validation is a common practice in machine learning [63]. The 3-fold cross validation used in this study held ~33% of the data for validation and ~66% for training, and then was rotated so that different thirds of the data were used in 3 different “folds” for each modeling algorithm tested. Within each of the 3 cross validation sets, the distribution of each forest type remained consistent to ensure that forest type distribution in the validation sets did not impact results when comparing between sets. These models were used to make predictions over the validation data and compared with the known values for each of the 3 models. This ensures that a prediction was made on every data point within the model and reduces the likelihood of overfitting the model by validating and training on the same data. In total, there were 15 separate models (3 models for each of the 5 classification algorithms) which were compared for each response input.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. Model Development,2
850,The two best performing models (Random Forest and Multinomial Logistic Regression) were applied over a portion of the TIU to assess model performance over the G-LiHT data swaths. The model predictions were compared with FIA plot designations for forest type where available by overlaying the model prediction raster and the FIA plot locations at a 13 m2 resolution. A 13 m2 resolution was used to compensate for the 1 to 3 m misalignment between the hyperspectral and lidar data. The raster cell that intersected with the plot center was used in comparing the model classification to the FIA plot designation of forest type for that location (Figure 4)., 2.

851," 3.1.1. Random ForestRandom forest with hyperspectral vegetation indices, DTM metrics, and CHM metrics as model inputs had the highest accuracy and kappa of all the classification algorithms and model inputs tested, at an overall accuracy of 78% and a kappa of 0.66 (Table 9). The kappa value of 0.66 indicates substantial agreement (0.61 < kappa < 0.8 [64]) between the known and predicted forest types for each subplot. Table 9 shows the combined accuracy of the three validation “folds” tested for the random forest model. Each of these three validation folds consisted of a unique subset of the data, thus by combining the three we were able to get the overall accuracy of the entire dataset.The kappa value of 0.66 indicates substantial agreement (0.61 < kappa < 0.8 [64]) between the known and predicted forest types for each subplot [64].When all available data were included in the model (hyperspectral bands and vegetation indices, with DTM and CHM metrics), the results were also promising, with accuracy reaching 75%. In this model, the kappa value, 0.62, also indicated substantial agreement between known and predicted forest type [64]. The other model inputs tested were the individual model inputs: CHM Metrics, Hyperspectral Vegetation Indices, Hyperspectral Bands, and DTM Metrics. These models all resulted in moderate accuracies, with CHM metrics resulting in the highest accuracy at 69% overall and a kappa value of 0.54, indicating just moderate agreement (0.41 < kappa < 0.6 [64]) between known and predicted forest type. The lowest accuracy and kappa were obtained when inputting only hyperspectral bands, with an accuracy of 45% and a kappa of just 0.23. The raw hyperspectral band data was significantly less predictive than the band-derived hyperspectral vegetation indices. 3.1.2. Support Vector MachineThe SVM model had a relatively high accuracy in the “best” model with 74% accuracy and a kappa of 0.60 (Table 10).

The second most accurate SVM model was the model with hyperspectral vegetation indices as inputs at 65%, with a kappa value indicating moderate agreement. 3.1.3. K-Nearest NeighborThe K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) models had moderate overall accuracy at ~64% overall with almost all model inputs (Table 11). DTM metrics had the lowest accuracy of any KNN model, at just 48% accuracy.

Naive Bayes ClassifierAlthough maximum likelihood models like the Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) are standard in classification-focused studies, in this case the NBC model performed the worst overall. Of all NBC model inputs tested, the model that included three data types (hyperspectral vegetation indices with DTM and CHM metrics) was the most accurate at 54% overall accuracy and a kappa of 0.38 (Table 12). The worst performing model included only hyperspectral bands and had an overall accuracy of just 20% and a kappa of 0.08. 3.1.5.

857,"Random forest with hyperspectral vegetation indices and DTM and CHM metrics as model inputs had the highest overall and kappa accuracy of all the classification algorithms and model inputs tested. Thus, a single model was produced using all subplots. This model was used to assess variable importance. The metric used to assess variable importance was mean decrease in accuracy, a common metric used in Random Forest studies [65,66].The canopy height model (CHM) values were shown to be the most important predictor, followed by roughness, surface volume ratio, and elevation (DTM). Canopy height is often the single most important lidar variability in forest studies, indicating that different forest types in this region have different canopy heights on average. The roughness and surface volume ratio capture differences in canopy texture between different forest types, and elevation is well known in ecology as a key attribute of site conditions that influences forest type. These predictor variables were followed by the Datt hyperspectral vegetation index [40] and topographic roughness index (TRI). Datt is sensitive to chlorophyll content, an important factor that helps discriminate among forest types. TRI is a topographic index that indicates the texture of the terrain. It is well known that topography is an important predictor of species distribution in plants [67,68]. It should be noted that many of these predictor variables are highly correlated, thus this may not be truly representative of which predictors are most important.", 3. Results, 3.2.

858,"The three most accurate models were the Random Forest, SVM, and MLR models which included hyperspectral vegetation indices and DTM and CHM metrics. For random forest, the confusion matrix shows the model predicted black spruce and paper birch forest types most accurately, and balsam poplar least accurately. The random forest model also frequently confused white spruce with black spruce and paper birch. Black spruce and paper birch are the most common forest types in the TIU, followed by white spruce (Table 14).Both Random Forest and SVM achieved high accuracies in the two most common classes, paper birch and black spruce, but had lackluster results in the less common classes, tamarack, cottonwood, aspen, and balsam poplar. The MLR model had very different results—it excelled in predicting the least common species and achieved moderate accuracies in the more common species Table 15). None of the three models had high accuracy for cover types with intermediate abundance (white spruce, non-forest). Overall, MLR had more consistently accurate performance when predicting forest type, despite having a slightly lower overall accuracy when compared to the equivalent Random Forest and SVM models.", 3.

MLR only had high accuracies in predicting paper birch and mid-range accuracies with Non-Forest (Table 16).", 3. Results, 3.4. Model Application,3
860,"This study aimed to provide an exploratory comparison of techniques for classifying forest type using well known accuracy statistics and widely available FIA data. Previous studies have worked to answer similar questions and achieved promising results. One study compared the accuracies of Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor, and Gaussian maximum likelihood with leave-one-out-covariance algorithms for the classifications of tree species using both hyperspectral and lidar data [14]. They found that the SVM classifier was the most accurate, yielding just over 89% kappa accuracy.This study also found SVM yielded higher accuracy than the K-Nearest Neighbor classifier, but the Gaussian maximum likelihood (GML) with leave-one-out-covariance algorithm was not tested. Instead, a naive Bayes classifier which is based on GML assumptions was tested and found to perform the worst of any model. This contradicts the findings with the GML model in [14] which found their GML algorithm outperformed the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm. This difference is likely due to differences in GML and KNN algorithm and model parameters used in each study.A second study compared the results of classifying seven tree species and a non-forest class in the Southern Alps of Italy using hyperspectral and lidar data with Support Vector Machines and Random Forest [15]. They found that SVM consistently outperformed Random Forest, achieving 95% overall accuracy. This differs from our findings which revealed that Random Forest outperformed SVM models, no matter the model input, achieving 77.53% overall accuracy with the best Random Forest model, and 73.89% with the best SVM model. This is likely due to differences in data pre-processing, especially in the case of hyperspectral data wherein [15] performed a minimum noise fraction transformation to reduce the data dimensionality. Both minimum noise fraction transformations and principal component analyses (PCA) are common data reduction steps when working with hyperspectral data [69]. Neither were performed in this study as it would impact the interpretability of the results and make it challenging to compare across the different algorithms.A second factor that may have influenced the difference in results between both [14,15] and this study are the model parameters used. In both SVM and KNN models, users must supply parameters to build the models. In this study, optimization scripts were used to test different model parameters and choose those that resulted in the highest accuracy. In the case of the KNN model, 100 different k-values were tested. For the SVM, multiple cost and gamma values were tested. Additionally, this study used a radial kernel for the SVM, while studies [14,15] used different kernels (a Gaussian kernel was used in the 2008 paper [14], and the kernel used in the 2012 paper [15] was not specified). All these differences in parameters used makes for difference in the final results.Within the training data there could be a significant difference between forest type as defined by the FIA protocol at the scale of a mapped condition (which must meet certain minimum size criteria, >1 acre, etc.) and the tree species present at a given location, or even subplot scale. In the FIA inventory, forest type (on conditions with >10% tree canopy cover) is based on the tree species with the dominant stocking. This means that on any given subplot, the actual forest composition may be much more mixed than is captured by a single forest type class. A subplot with 51% stocking (or tree cover) of white spruce is spectrally very different from a plot that is 100% white spruce, but the methods here treat both examples as the same class. Though this is the method for forest type classification used by the USDA Forest Service throughout the US, it can create challenges when using this data as ground truth for multispectral classification algorithms, and likely contributed to lower accuracies for white spruce and other species that commonly form mixed stands. Future studies may consider using different field validation data and carrying out a hypothesis test to determine if differences in accuracies between models are statistically significant. Additionally, future studies should consider reporting precision and recall, as opposed to overall accuracy, to compare between models [70]. Each of these steps would allow for better reporting of the uncertainty associated with each measure of accuracy and make for better comparison between classification algorithms.Unlike the potential loss of accuracy due to the spectral mixing within subplots, the nested plot design in this study likely inflated overall accuracy. The FIA protocol is designed such that, for each plot, there are four subplots on which forest type information is collected. There are just 36.576 m (120 ft) between the center subplot and the surrounding three subplots. This leads to an issue of pseudo replication and spatial autocorrelation as the outer three subplots are so close together that they are likely to include similar vegetation. In this study, each subplot was treated as if it was unique and independent of others. This likely led to an inflation in accuracy which cannot be overcome until a more balanced dataset with more equal representation of all forest types within the TIU is available.Imbalanced datasets are common in ecological studies using natural datasets. While we hope that more data will become available for future research to improve the imbalanced nature of the data in this dataset, we identified multiple ways to overcome the impacts of imbalanced datasets. One common method is to sample the dataset so that there is an equal number of samples in each class that is equal to or less than the size of the smallest class. For example, in this case the smallest forest type class (Tamarack) has four subplots of that class. This methodology would require that for every other forest type class, just four subplots are sampled and used in model training and validation to ensure that the number of samples of each class is the same. This was not feasible in this study because only four samples per class is not enough to train and validate a representative model, so this type of down sampling was not performed.A second method of overcoming this issue is to oversample the dataset so that each class is sampled with replacement until it reaches a quantity that is typically greater than or equal to the largest class in the dataset. This same methodology can be performed in an ensemble called bootstrap aggregating, or bagging. Bagging is the process by which one samples a dataset D of length n with replacement, to generate a new dataset D1 of length m wherein each class is equally represented [48].In this case, bagging was implemented in all models to test its impact overall and kappa accuracy. Each class was sampled with replacement until we reached a set equal in length to the largest class within the dataset (280 data points). In most cases, bagging did not improve overall or kappa accuracy. In the cases where accuracy was improved, most models were already performing so poorly that the improved accuracy still did not make the algorithm or model inputs a contender for the best algorithm and inputs. Thus, bagging was not included as a part of this study.The primary objective of the study was to assess the potential for classifying forest type in the context of a national forest inventory program using high-resolution airborne data. While pseudo replication caused by the nested plot design used in this study, and overfitting of the model in the less common forest types, such as tamarack and poplar, are issues that should be addressed in future studies to provide a full accounting of the classification uncertainty, the results of this study indicate the potential for application of machine learning algorithms to classify forest types in the forest inventory context using a combination of field measurements and high-resolution airborne remote sensing data. As this FIA effort in Alaska continues, leading to more FIA plots and G-LiHT data collected throughout the state, the sample size for every forest type will increase significantly, possibly allowing pseudoreplication to be dealt with by using just one subplot from each plot to represent the entire plot. Alternatively, training and validation datasets could be selected using independent datasets distinct from the FIA field plot sample (at representative sites such as experimental forests, etc.) and then the resulting model could be applied to the FIA field data and G-LiHT data, which would allow for a straightforward assessment of accuracy across the FIA plot sample (although obviously also requiring the collection of an additional, expensive data set).Future studies could use alternative methods for reducing correlation, and dimensionality, of the input data through PCAs or other techniques. It is also important to note that the variables used in this study are not the only lidar and hyperspectral data-derived metrics that can be used to describe forest composition. There are a multitude of other metrics, from lidar grid metrics to other hyperspectral vegetation indices that have been used in previous studies and may increase model performance [71,72]. Additionally, when aggregating the hyperspectral and lidar metrics over each subplot, using a standard deviation of the metrics instead of or in addition to the average of the metrics may also improve model performance.", 4. Discussion,None,4
861,"Overall, the Random Forest classification algorithm resulted in the highest overall and kappa accuracy. There are many factors that make ecological data complex and difficult to model [73,74]. Many studies use Random Forests to overcome these complexities and still yield high prediction accuracies [75,76]. This was likely also the case in this study, resulting in the highest overall accuracy coming from Random Forest.The MLR model with hyperspectral vegetation indices, DTM metrics, and CHM metrics had the best performance when predicting individual classes, especially rarer classes. This may indicate that the MLR model would be a more suitable model in cases where the objective is to accurately predict rare classes. It also indicates that it may be more suitable to use multiple models when predicting forest type. One could use Random Forest for predicting the more common forest types, and MLR for predicting the less common forest types.This study also tested a multitude of model inputs and found that including hyperspectral vegetation indices, DTM metrics, and CHM metrics as model inputs yielded the highest overall and kappa accuracy with almost all classification algorithms. Each of these model input groups describe different ecological factors that are essential for distinguishing forest types.Topography plays an important role in the distribution of vegetation across the landscape, and the topographic variables that can be derived from a DTM can in predicting vegetation distribution [67,77,78]. Unsurprisingly, when these model inputs were tested with all subplots in one Random Forest model, roughness, topographic roughness index, and elevation were found to be extremely important in predicting forest type.The canopy height model describes the over story structure and can be used to describe species composition when used alongside optical sensors [79,80,81]. In this study, we used both the raw canopy height model and a multitude of CHM-derived metrics to describe the over story. Canopy height was found to be the most important predictor for forest type, with surface volume ratio following close behind.When it comes to hyperspectral model inputs, including the raw hyperspectral band data with the hyperspectral vegetation indices and CHM and DTM metrics in the Random Forest model decreased accuracy. While it is unclear exactly why this is, we hypothesize that the 114 hyperspectral bands are so highly correlated that they had a negative impact on prediction accuracies. Additionally, transforming the raw hyperspectral data into vegetation indices allows for the data to be relativized, which can boost model performance in many cases.In summary, this study concluded that:
Of all classification algorithms tested, Random Forest resulted in the highest overall and kappa accuracy.A combination of structural and spectral metrics resulted in the highest overall accuracy, including Canopy Height and Digital Terrain model metrics with hyperspectral vegetation indices and five raw hyperspectral bands.", 5.

862,"The forest ecosystem is very important to the Earth’s ecosystem. Its biomass and carbon storage play a very important role in global climate change and material circulation, and it can directly or indirectly regulate and buffer the global climate change [1,2]. Forest biomass is the dry weight of organic matter produced by per unit area of forest during a specific period of its life time [3]. The aboveground biomass (AGB), accounting for 70% to 90% of the total forest biomass, is one of the significant carbon pools in forest ecosystems [4,5]. As a basic quantitative characteristic of forest ecosystems, AGB can be used to assess the growth and health of forests. Therefore, fast and accurate acquisition of AGB information is extremely important for forest management and understanding of ecosystems, carbon cycles and carbon dynamics [6,7].Traditional forest parameters estimation methods are based on field measurements, which is time-consuming and costly, and scale-limited. Recently, remote sensing technologies have been widely used for estimating and mapping forest parameters [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20], because of their low cost, high temporal resolutions, and large coverage. Optical remote sensing data, obtained by a passive remote sensing system, have been widely used in biomass research [7,10,11,12]. Generally, vegetation indices derived from the red, near infrared (NIR) or red edge bands of optical images are highly correlated with forest AGB [18,20,21,22]. However, in the areas with high forest canopy closure and accumulation, the cascade of canopy and the diversity of species distribution will cause saturation on the remote sensing image, so the biomass estimated by vegetation index is lower than the real value [20,23,24]. Hyperspectral data usually have higher spectral resolution than multispectral data. The almost continuous spectral information contained in hyperspectral data can effectively improve the ability to identify different objects. However, these large number of spectral bands also bring about information redundancy and difficulty in feature variable selection, and also increase the load of data processing [25,26]. Microwave usually has a certain penetration ability to forest canopy. As an active microwave sensor, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) can observe the Earth all-day in all weathers, so it can obtain vegetation information at any time and any place [27,28]. Many studies employ SAR images (e.g., RadarSat-2, Sentinel-1, ALOS PALSAR) to map forest AGB [3,14,15]. However, the SAR signal is usually susceptible to the influence of terrain and complex canopy structure, which is difficult to eliminate [15]. SAR data also have the saturation problem, which results in poor estimation accuracy [14,29]. In addition, the acquisition of SAR data is relatively expensive and difficult (except for a few free SAR data, such as Sentinel-1), and the data processing is also complicated [3,29,30]. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) system emits a laser beam to irradiate the surface of an object and analyzes the return signal. The emitted laser pulse can penetrate the forest canopy and reach the ground surface, so as to obtain the three-dimensional structure of vegetation. LiDAR has been successfully applied to forest parameter inversion, especially the inversion of tree height, tree spatial structure, and biomass [31,32,33,34]. However, the LiDAR data are few and expensive, which impedes its applications for large-scale biomass estimation [35,36,37,38]. In terms of data archive, availability, spatial coverage and resolution, and data processing load, optical remote sensing images with high spatial and temporal resolution are optimal for large scale forest AGB dynamic monitoring [2,7,20,38]. Optical imagery fusion technology can fully integrate the advantages of different multispectral sensor images to produce new multispectral data with high spatial and spectral resolution, it has great potential for improving the spectral sensitivity and alleviating the forest AGB estimation saturation problem [20,24]. Generally, high-resolution images contain rich spatial texture information, and medium-resolution remote sensing images have rich spectral information and extensive temporal and spatial coverage. For forest classification or forest structure parameter estimation, most fusion schemes combine high-resolution panchromatic image with medium-resolution multi-spectral images, which can improve image clarity, increase spatial texture details, and help visual interpretation [20,39,40,41,42,43,44,45]. However, the pan-sharpening fusion method cannot add enough useful spectral information for the forest AGB estimation. In the study of forest growing stock volume (GSV) estimation, Li et al. have shown that fusing high-resolution multi-spectral image (GF-2) with medium-resolution multi-spectral image (Landsat 8) can improve the spatial resolution and increase the image spectral information [24]. However, only the Gram Schmidt fusion algorithm is used in their study, and there is no comparative analysis about other fusion methods or other optical images. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the utility of other classic fusion algorithms for fusing Sentinel-2 and GF-2 multispectral images for forest AGB estimation. Moreover, effective evaluation and accurate selection of multi-spectral fusion data suitable for forest AGB estimation is a key issue.Feature selection is the key to improve the performance of the forest AGB estimation model [46,47,48,49,50,51,52]. However, there is little evidence to indicate that the features screened by a certain method have a good accuracy of AGB or GSV estimation for all regression models [24,52]. Li et al. [24] proposed a feature variable screening and combination optimization procedure based on the distance correlation coefficient and k-nearest neighbor algorithm (DC-FSCK). This algorithm considers the correlation, heterogeneity and combination optimization characteristics between feature variables, and can select the best feature combination for the forest GSV estimation research. The DC-FSCK method has achieved very satisfactory results when the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm is used [53]. However, when the random forest (RF) regression algorithm is used, the performance of DC-FSCK is not ideal. Therefore, in order to improve the robustness of the feature variable combination method, we need to optimize the regression model of the algorithm based on the original DC-FSCK algorithm framework in order for it to adapt more application scenarios. The commonly used models for AGB estimation include parametric regression models and non-parametric machine learning regression models [11,20]. Parameter regression models, such as linear regression and perceptron, estimate AGB by constructing a regression formula on the basis of the relationship between the measured AGB and remote sensing feature variables, topographic factors, and forest stand parameters. Non-parametric machine learning models, such as RF regression and support vector regression (SVR), can obtain different fitting functions by the training data, which can finally predict the target value [23,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50]. Ensemble machine learning algorithms learn training samples by constructing and integrating multiple learners, which have higher accuracy than traditional non-parametric or parametric methods in the forest parameter estimation based on small sample data [24,43,51,52,53,54]. Generally, there are three ensemble methods: stacking, bagging (e.g., RF), and boosting (such as adaptive boosting, gradient boosting decision tree, extreme gradient boosting, and categorical boosting) [52]. The stacking algorithm has good performance in forest GSV prediction and vegetation classification research [24,55,56,57], but there is no report on its application in forest AGB estimation.In short, remote sensing data sources, feature variable combinations, and the estimation models influence estimating the forest AGB using remote sensing data [20,36,44]. Therefore, this study will solve these problems by applying the following steps.(1) GF-2 and Sentinel-2 multispectral images are fused by four classic fusion algorithms to get the Sentinel-like images. Then, these fused images are assessed by a comprehensive evaluation method, which using the image information entropy, grayscale mean, standard deviation, average gradient, and image-based model cross-validation estimation error as the comprehensive evaluation index. Hence, the fused image suitable for AGB estimation is screened out.(2) Feature variables are extracted from the fused image and terrain feature derivation factors (e.g., elevation, slope, aspect), and two feature combination optimization methods are used to screen feature variables for AGB estimation.(3) The ensemble machine learning algorithm is utilized to build a forest AGB estimation model based on the selected feature combination, and is compared the performance with other machine learners.We expect that the combination of fused images, new feature selection method and ensemble machine learning algorithm will yield a quickly and highly accurate AGB map of forests.", 1.

868,"In this study, in order to improve the resolution of the multi-spectral image, we used the GS method to fuse the GF2 panchromatic image with the multi-spectral (blue, green, red) images. Then, in order to couple the two sensors data and increase the image information, the fused GF-2 multispectral images were fused with the Sentinel-2 images to generate Sentinel-like multispectral images with a spatial resolution of 1 m. Compared with the original GF-2 and Sentinel-2 images, the fused Sentinel-like images contain more details and more spectral information. In order to find a multi-spectral image fusion method suitable for forest AGB estimation, we compare four image fusion algorithms, GS, NND, WRM, and BT. In this study, each multispectral band (B1_blue, B2_green, and B3_red) of the GF-2 image was fused with the Sentinel-2 image, and the obtained images contain 10 bands including 4 vegetation red edges (Table 4). The fused images are denoted by the fusion method and band name. For example, using the GS method to fuse the B1_blue image of GF-2 with Sentinel-2, the obtained image is denoted as GS_B1. We assume that the spectral information contained in each pixel in the image has a specific correlation with the average AGB of trees per unit area, and this information will not be lost after the image is resampled. Therefore, after multispectral data fusion, this study needs to resample the fused high-resolution images to a resolution similar to the sample plot size. Then, the regression model is established by using the measured AGB of sample plots and pixel spectral information.", 3. Methods, 3.2. Multispectral Image Data Fusion,3

Finally, the extracted variables are combined with the measured AGB data to generate a sample dataset. 3.3.2. The Feature Selection and the AGB Estimation RMSEr Calculation for Each Fused Image Using the sample data set and RF regression algorithm, we establish the AGB estimation model that contains k decision trees. We use the out-of-bag (OOB) data to calculate the OOB data error of each decision tree in the RF regression model (Equation (1)), denoted as ErrOOB1i. Then, we traverse all the feature variables, and randomly add noise to the feature variable Vi, and calculate the OOB data error again, denoted as ErrOOB2i.

The standard deviation can be used to evaluate the gray dispersion of the image. The greater the standard deviation value, the greater the image contrast. The average gradient of the image can reflect the definition of the image to a certain extent. The larger the average gradient of the image, the more spatial details will be reflected [42].

873,"Texture feature variables are very helpful for remote sensing data modeling [20,24], so we extract texture features from the selected fused images and terrain factors derived from DEM data, including elevation, slope, aspect, and topographic wetness index (TWI) [62]. Relevant studies show that macro topographical factors (e.g., TWI) are related to regional forest AGB [63]. TWI is a physical index of the impact of regional topography on runoff flow direction and accumulation, which is helpful to identify rainfall runoff patterns, potential areas of increased soil water content, and ponding areas. Generally, when other conditions of forest (e.g., environmental and climatic) are the same, the larger TWI is more conducive to the growth of trees.

Feature Variable Extraction In this study, the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) is used to measure texture of the optical images and terrain data [20]. By calculating the mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment, correlation, we obtain the direction, field and change range of image gray, which reflect the correlation between texture gray levels well. We extract the textural images using the GLCM with step size [1,1] and window size (3 × 3, 5 × 5, 7 × 7, 9 × 9). In order to analyze the contributions of vegetation indices, single-window texture factor and multi-window texture factor to the forest parameter estimations, we design three sets of feature variables, F1, F2, and F3 (Table 4).  3.4.2. Feature Variable CombinationsThe DC-FSCK method was proposed by Li et al. to choose the optimal feature variable combination for GSV estimation [24], but the feature variables selected by one method may not bring good accuracy of AGB estimation in all regression models [24,52]. In addition, RFR algorithm has excellent performance in many applications of forest mapping [34]. Li et al. [58] compared the performance of six feature variable selection methods in forest GSV estimation, and found that the feature variable combination optimization method based on RFR model performs best. In order to improve the robustness of the feature variable selection methods, we replace the KNN in DC-FSCK method with the RFR algorithms (Figure A2). Therefore, in the second stage of the RF-S model, for each data scenario, we apply the KNN-based method and the RFR-based method to screen feature variables for forest AGB estimation. 3.4.3. Stacking Ensemble AlgorithmThe estimation result of a single model has the disadvantages of one-sidedness and contingency. Therefore, the ensemble machine learning model that integrates the results of multiple models for prediction has better performance than a single model. Generally, there are three types of ensemble machine learning regression algorithms, including bagging, boosting, and stacking [59]. Stacking generalization algorithm was first proposed by Wolpert in 1992, and he believes that it is similar to cross validation, which is integrated through “winner takes all” [57]. Bagging and boosting algorithms usually took the decision regression tree as the basic model [56,57]. So they are the integration of similar models, while stacking algorithms are relatively more flexible, which can be the ensemble of similar models or heterogeneous models. This research plans to adopt the integration algorithm of the stacking machine learning model that combines the prediction results of the basic model to realize accurate AGB estimation. The base model, meta-model, and hyperparameter optimization are the keys for the stacking integration algorithm. In this study, the base models are SVR, RFR, and KNN, the meta-model is least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). Therefore, this study comprehensively considers the coupling and complementarity between these models, and realizes the integration optimization of the regression model through the iterative selection of models and the automatic adjustment of hyperparameters (Figure 3 Stage2).

By calculating the mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment, correlation, we obtain the direction, field and change range of image gray, which reflect the correlation between texture gray levels well. We extract the textural images using the GLCM with step size [1,1] and window size (3 × 3, 5 × 5, 7 × 7, 9 × 9).

878,"In this study, four classic pixel-level fusion algorithms (GS, NND, WRM, and BT) are used to fuse three GF-2 multispectral images with Sentinel-2 images. Compared with the original Sentinel-2 image (Figure A3), all Sentinel-like RGB true color images (Figure 4) have enhanced clarity. Specifically, the GS and NND fusion images (Figure 4(a1–a3,b1–b3)) have more obvious texture details, better clarity. The overall tone of the WRM fusion images (Figure 4(c1–c3)) is natural, close to Sentinel-2 image, indicating high spectral retention. However, these images have no obvious texture details and have a lot of noise and outliers. The BT fusion images (Figure 4(d1–d3)) have more obvious texture details, but lower tone and larger spectral distortion than the original Sentinel-2 image.As shown in Figure 5, Band 8 (Vegetation Red Edge 4) of all the Sentinel-like images except Figure 5j–l) has the largest spectral value. The spectral value ranges of Band1–3 are narrow, but others are wide, which is highly consistent with the Sentinel-2 image (Figure 5m). Unlike the original GF-2 image whose spectral value peaks in Band2 (Green), Sentinel-2 and all Sentinel-like images have a higher spectral pixel values in the blue band than in the red band, which may be due to the low resolution of Sentinel-2, small crown width, needle-shaped leaves, and large gaps in the Chinese fir woodland. The spectral dispersion of the GS and NND fusion images in the visible light and vegetation red edge bands is better than that of the original Sentinel-2, especially that in Figure 5b,c,f. The spectral distribution of WRM fusion image Figure 5g–i is basically the same as that of Sentinel-2 image. For the BT fusion image Figure 5j–l, the spectral distribution ranges of visible light and vegetation red band are very close. As Figure 6 shows, almost all Sentinel-like spectral curves are similar to Sentinel-2, except for the BT fusion images. BT is a simple fusion method that decomposes multi-spectral image pixels into colors and brightness, and then multiplies them with high-resolution images. It can only fuse 3 multi-spectral images at a time. This may be the reason of the distortion in the fusion image Figure 5j–l. Yang et al. [64] compared the GS, NND and WRM fusion methods, and found that the change trend of the spectral curve of the images fused by three methods are basically the same as that of the original images, but the WRM fusion image retains much more spectral information than other images. This result is consistent with our research.", 4. Results and Discussion , 4.1. Twelve Sentinel-Like Images Generated by Four Fusion Methods,4
879,"The RF feature selection method is used to quickly screen feature variables from the 14 datasets, including GF-2, Sentinel-2, and the 12 fused Sentinel-like images. By doing this, the feature redundancy and model computation load can be effectively reduced. For each data scenario, that is, 14 groups of feature variables are selected from the above 14 datasets, we use RFR algorithm to establish AGB estimation model. The minimum estimation RMSEr is obtained for image evaluation (Figure A4).Among the 12 fused Sentinel-like images, NND_B3 (0.2896), GS_B2 (0.3007), and GS_B3 (0.3085) have the lowest RMSEr. We compare 14 RMSEr values by the one-sample T test method, and the results show that NND_B3, GS_B2, and GS_B3 images are significantly different from other images at the 0.05 level, with the p values of 0.000, 0.000, and 0.021, respectively. The estimation error of these three images is significantly lower than that of other images. The GS method was used to fuse GF-2 multispectral and Landsat 8 images in the GSV estimation study of Chinese pine and larch in North China [24]. The results show that the fusion images obtained based on the B2 and B3 bands of GF-2 images have higher GSV estimation accuracy than other images. In that study, the stepwise regression analysis is used for feature selection, which is different from the RFR-based method, but the results of image data source selection are basically the same, which further confirms the feasibility of the improved method.Table 5 shows the normalized statistics of five evaluation indicators of the fused images. Image NND_B3 has the values of entropy, standard deviation and average gradient significantly different from other images at the 0.05 level, indicating that the image has more information, better texture details and spatial information. Furthermore, its RMSEr estimated based on the RF regression algorithm is the lowest, indicating that the image has good forest AGB estimation accuracy. The RMSEr of GS_B2 and GS_B3 are also low, but are greater than that of NND_B3. Although WRM_B1 has good results in mean, standard deviation, and entropy, it has the largest RMSEr. Comprehensively considering the information volume, quality and estimation error, we select NND_B3 for the forest AGB modeling and estimation. GS_B2 and GS_B3 images will also be processed to compare with NND_B3 images in Section 4.5.", 4. Results and Discussion , 4.2. Selecting Best Fused Image for Forest AGB Estimation,4
880,"The KNN-based and RFR-based feature combination optimization methods are used to select the optimal feature variable combination from the three feature datasets (F1, F2, and F3). Six feature combinations of image NND_B3 are shown in Table 6. For feature set F1, the KNN-based and the RFR-based methods select four and three feature variables, respectively. Three of the seven feature variables are related to SWIR2, indicating that the short-wave infrared band is sensitive to forest vegetation. In F2 and F3, most of the features selected by the two methods are texture feature variables, indicating that the texture feature has a very close relationship with the forest AGB. ", 4. Results and Discussion , 4.3. Selection of Optimal Feature Combination from the Fused Image,4
881,"The AGB estimation results of the 4 regression algorithms using the optimal feature combination are shown in Table A1. The KNN-based and RFR-based methods are used in all data scenarios, but only the better results are shown in Table A1. For comparison, three data sources, GF-2, Sentinel-2, and NND_B3, are used to estimate the forest AGB. The stacking algorithm has good performance in all data scenarios. Take NND_B3 as an example. In the F2 feature set, the RMSEr of the stacking algorithm is 22.09%, which is lower than SVR (24.96%), KNN (24.55%), and RF (22.21%). In the F3 feature set, the RMSEr of stacking (15.53%) is lower than SVR (19.88%), KNN (17.11%), and RF (19.78%) at the statistical level of 0.05. Similarly, in the GF-2 and Sentinel-2 data scenarios, the RMSEr of the stacking algorithm is lower than the other three algorithms, and R2, adjusted R2, and MAE also have relatively better results. This result is consistent with the performance of the stacking algorithm in the reference [24]. The stacking algorithm used in this study comprehensively considers the coupling and complementarity between models, and optimizes the regression model through the iterative selection of models and the automatic adjustment of hyperparameters, so it can significantly improve the accuracy and stability of AGB estimation of Chinese fir plantations. Luo et al. [52] studied AGB estimation of the forests in Northeast China based on the Ninth National Forest Continuous Inventory data and Landsat OLI images. They used the recursive feature elimination for feature selection and the categorical boosting as the regression algorithm, and achieved the highest accuracy for coniferous forest, with the RMSE of 26.54 Mg/ha. Coniferous forests in northern China are mainly pine plantations, which are biologically similar to the Chinese fir plantations in southern China. The pine plantations in north China usually have smaller per unit AGB values than Chinese fir plantations in south China [24]. In addition, the topography of the planted forests in northern China is flatter. Therefore, theoretically, the accuracy of AGB estimation of the planted coniferous forests in northern China is usually higher than that in southern China. However, the lowest RMSE and RMSEr value (26.54 Mg/ha, 25.62%) achieved by Luo et al. [52] is larger than our results (15.79 t/ha, 15.53%). On the one hand, their method ignores the ensemble of regression models and the combined effect of feature variables, though they used a large number of field survey plots. On the other hand, they only used Landsat images. Zhang et al. evaluated eight machine learning regression algorithms for estimating forest AGB using satellite remote sensing data and multiple auxiliary data [54]. They concluded that the categorical boosting (CatBoost) algorithm has the best accuracy among these eight algorithms, with the R2 (0.72), RMSE (45.63 Mg/ha), and RMSEr (25%). However, the CatBoost achieved poor performances in estimating the AGB of evergreen needleleaf forests, as the RMSEr is larger than 60%. The poor accuracy could be resulted from the underestimation of evergreen needleleaf forest samples due to the saturation problems.", 4. Results and Discussion , 4.4. The AGB Estimation Result Analysis,4
882,"The NND_B3 obtained by fusing the red band of GF-2 with Sentinel-2 by the NND method has the advantages of both GF-2 and Sentinel-2. GF-2 and Sentinel-2 have similar AGB estimation performance in F1 feature sets. However, for feature sets F2 and F3, the RMSEr of NND_B3, GF-2 and Sentinel-2 are different (Table A1). For the F2 feature set, the optimal RMSEr of Sentinel-2 is 0.0288 larger and R2 is 0.1704 smaller than that of NND_B3. For the F3 feature set, the optimal RMSEr of NND_B3 is lower than Sentinel-2 by 0.0515, and R2 is larger by 0.2343. Using NND_B3, the estimation accuracy is greatly improved. As the scatter plot of Figure A5 shows, NND_B3 has more concentrated distribution, clearer fitting trend, and higher correlation coefficient r than other data. We also compared the estimation accuracy of using GS_B2 (RMSEr, 0.1804) and GS_B3 (RMSEr, 0.1893) and found their accuracy is lower than using NND_B3(RMSEr, 0.1553) (Figure 7). ", 4. Results and Discussion , 4.5. The AGB Estimation Ability of Different Image Data Source,4
883,"Different feature selection methods are applicable to different estimation models. In this study, KNN-based and RFR-based were used to select the optimal combination of feature variables for F1, F2, and F3 feature sets. The estimation results of 36 models indicate that (Table A1), for the F2 feature set of Sentinel-2 and NND_B3, the RFR-based feature variable selection method is better than the KNN-based in all models. In addition, as Table A1 and Figure A4 show, RFR-based has a lower RMSEr value in the F1 feature set of GF-2, Sentinel-2, and NND_B3 images than the RF importance index method. This means that the RFR-based method has better performance than traditional RF-base method in the feature selection of forest AGB estimation. For most data scenarios, when the RF regression algorithm is used, the RFR-based performs better than the KNN-based. The KNN-based is better than the RFR-based for the SVR, KNN, and stacking models of the F1 and F3 feature variable set. This result indicates that the RFR-based method can be combined with the KNN-based method in different model application scenarios.", 4. Results and Discussion , 4.6. The Best Feature Selection Method for Different Data Scenarios and Different Estimation Models,4
884,"The vegetation index and texture feature variables of optical remote sensing images can be used for forest classification and structural parameter prediction [38]. The forest AGB estimation performance of different feature sets varies significantly (Table A1). F3 performs the best, F2 is the second, and F1 is the worst. Taking the NND_B3 image as an example, when the RF and stacking estimation models are used, the RMSEr of F3 is 0.0243 and 0.0656 less than that of F2, respectively, and the MAE is 1.78 t/ha and 5.0 t/ha less, respectively. Similarly, compared with the RESEr of F1, the RMSEr of F2 is 0.0222 and 0.0269 less, respectively, and the MAE is 1.83 t/ha and 3.78 t/ha smaller, respectively. Comparison shows that the estimated AGB results of F3 are more correlated with the measured AGB values (Figure A5). The average value of r is 0.6868, and the maximum value can reach 0.8427. F1 performs poorly, with the mean value of r being 0.4143 and the minimum value being 0.1614.Figure A6 shows the variation range and trend of AGB estimation deviation of different feature sets of NND_B3 image. The overall estimation deviation of F3 is relatively low. Larger RMSErs are mainly of the samples whose measured AGB exceeds 140 t/ha, and there are only 11 samples with the absolute deviation exceeding 20 t/ha. F2 and F1 have 19 and 24 samples with the absolute deviation exceeding 20 t/ha, respectively, and 5 samples of F1 have the absolute deviation larger than 40 t/ha.", 4. Results and Discussion , 4.7. AGB Estimation Performance of Different Feature Sets,4
885,"Figure 8(a1–c3) are the AGB spatial distribution map of Chinese fir plantation estimated by the Stacking algorithm using the GF-2, Sentinel-2 and NND_B3, respectively. Figure 8(a1,b1,c1) are the estimation results of the F1 feature set of GF-2, Sentinel-2 and NND_B3, respectively, whose AGB values are between 90 t/ha and 110 t/ha, generally low. This indicates that the estimated AGB value is less saturated and overestimated for low values. The results of the F2 feature set (Figure 8(a2,b2,c2)) have less overestimation, and the estimated values range between 69 t/ha to 158 t/ha. The results of the F3 feature set are the best, with AGB ranging between 45 t/ha and 176 t/ha. The green area of Figure 8(c3) is larger than Figure 8(a3,b3), indicating more AGB estimates are between 135t/ha and 176t/ha. In short, NND_B3 has better estimation results than GF-2 and Sentinel-2, and it improves the saturation significantly. The F3 feature set with multi-window texture factors is better than F1 and F2 in the lower AGB area. It has better performance, and supresses the overestimation, indicating that the multi-window texture factor can suppress the overestimation in the low-value area of AGB. Figure 8(d1–d3) show the AGB result distribution map estimated by SVR, KNN, and RF model using the F3 feature set of NND_B3 image. The obtained AGB values range between 44 t/ha and 168 t/ha, 49 t/ha and 176 t/ha, and 59 t/ha and 161 t/ha, respectively. The SVR model has higher accuracy in the low-value area, but lower accuracy in the high-value (green) area than the KNN and RF models. In the southern area, Figure 8(c3,d2) and d3 all have higher AGB estimates, but Figure 8(d1) has low AGB, which also indicates that the SVR model has the underestimation problem in the area with higher AGB values. Finally, compared with the estimation results of Figure 8(c3,d1–d3), Figure 8(c3) has more high value areas and wider AGB value range, indicating that the stacking model has stronger generalization ability and higher accuracy than SVR, KNN, and RF. Zhao et al. [65] studied the AGB estimation data saturation problem using Landsat TM (Thematic Mapper) images for different vegetation types and obtained the forest biomass saturation values of 159 Mg/ha for pine (Pinus Massoniana) plantations forests in Eastern China. Gao et al. [19] compared several models for AGB estimation in subtropical forests, and found that the RF algorithm is not suitable for AGB prediction when the AGB values are too small (<40 Mg/ha) or too large (>160 Mg/ha). This is consistent with the AGB estimation result based on the RFR model in this study.", 4. Results and Discussion , 4.8. Prediction and Map of the AGB of Chinese fir Plantation in the Study Area,4
886,"This study has proved the superiority of multi-spectral fusion image combined with stacking integrated modeling method in estimating the AGB of Chinese fir plantation, but there are some limitations in the application. First of all, optical remote sensing images are usually polluted by clouds. This affects the imaging quality of remote sensing images to a certain extent, and even significantly reduces the availability of image data. Therefore, the difference in imaging time for GF-2 and Sentinel-2 brings certain uncertainty to image fusion processing. Secondly, as shown in Table 2, more than half of the Chinese fir plantation sample plots are not really mature, meaning that tree growth that occurred between 2016 and 2017 has not bet accounted for. Third, the stacking integration algorithm usually has a great computation load [24,55], which should be reduced. The categorical boosting regression algorithm and extreme gradient boosting regression algorithm works well in classification and regression prediction [48,52,53], so combining them with the stacking ensemble algorithm may improve the forest AGB estimation.", 4. Results and Discussion , 4.9. Limitations and Future Works,4
887,"In this study, the RF-S method was proposed for estimating the AGB of Chinese fir plantations in south China. The results demonstrate the superiority of fusing GF-2 multispectral and Sentinel-2 data, as well as the potential of the improved feature combination optimization method at regional scales. The stacking generalization method based on the fused image (NND_B3) has higher estimation accuracy and saturation than other images and regression models. The achieved adjusted R2 and RMSEr are 0.6306 and 15.53%, respectively. This study uses both vegetation index and texture feature factors of multiple window sizes as the input feature variables for the training model, which can provide higher accuracy and data saturation for Chinese fir plantation AGB mapping. However, the proposed RF-S strategy has huge computation load, due to forest plot data collection, multi-spectral image fusion processing, feature variable combination optimization, and integration of multiple models. Thus, methods for improving the computation efficiency should be developed before this strategy is widely applied. This research provides some insights for forest AGB estimation research based on remote sensing images and sample plots data modeling.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
888,"Crop parameters, such as leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass (AGB) are crucial for accurately monitoring crop growth for agriculture management [1,2], and accurate estimates of crop variables can help improve crop monitoring and yield predictions [3,4]. Traditional methods to estimate crop parameters are based on destructive measurements, which not only are time and labor consuming but, more importantly, are also difficult to apply over large areas. Remote-sensing data acquired from the various platforms (ground, airborne, and satellite) can capture crop-canopy spectra and thereby provide information on the biochemical composition of the crop canopy [5,6,7,8], and remote-sensing technology is now used for estimating crop parameters such as LAI at different spatial resolutions [6], AGB [5,7], chlorophyll (Chl) [9,10], and the fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) [11,12].Timely and accurate estimates of crop parameters are crucial for agriculture management. To achieve this goal, remote sensing via unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has recently attracted the attention of many researchers because it yields remote-sensing images with higher temporal, spatial, and ground resolutions than are available from satellites [13,14,15,16]. Unmanned aerial vehicle remote sensing has numerous advantages compared with remote sensing from conventional aerial vehicles, including cost, weight, flight speed, and flight altitude. More importantly, however, UAVs have simpler requirements for takeoff and landing.Crop-canopy spectral reflectance is determined by the parameters of the internal structure of leaves (i.e., leaf mesophyll, chlorophyll a and b concentrations, water content, dry matter content, mass per unit area, brown pigments, and total carotenoid content) and of the canopy structure (i.e., LAI, leaf-inclination distribution function, sun and sensor zenith angles, and soil background) [17,18,19,20]. Therefore, the crop parameters can be estimated from the spectral characteristics. However, redundancy and multicollinearity are two important aspects of hyperspectral data that cannot be ignored. Many studies on estimating crop parameters tend to use the characteristic spectra in the visible and near infrared blue (460 nm), green (560 nm), red (670 nm), near infrared (800 nm), and red-edge bands) [21,22,23].A vegetation index (VI) is a combination of two or more characteristic spectra acquired by multispectral or hyperspectral remote-sensing techniques. It is a simple, effective, and empirical measure of the status of surface vegetation. Many VIs have been developed to estimate crop parameters, such as the normalized difference VI (NDVI) [21], the two-band enhanced VI (EVI2) [23], and the optimized soil regulation VI (OSAVI) [22]. However, many VIs tend to saturate when used to estimate crop parameters because they are insensitive at medium-to-high canopy cover [24]. Compared with using only optical remote-sensing information, several fruitful results have been obtained in numerous previous studies by using multi-source remote-sensing data. For example, Gao et al. [25] estimated the LAI, height, and biomass of maize by using single-temporal Huanjing-1A/B (spectral) and RADARSAT-2 (synthetic aperture radar, SAR). Jin et al. [24] estimated the LAI and biomass of winter wheat by using multi-temporal Huanjing-1A/B (spectral) and RADARSAT-2 (SAR). These studies indicate that best results for are obtained when spectral data and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) or SAR data are combined.Unmanned aerial vehicles may be equipped with snapshot sensors, global navigation satellite systems, and inertial navigation systems, and the combined system can obtain geo-referenced images in various geographic locations. The corresponding field digital orthophoto maps (DOMs) and crop surface models (CSMs) [26] can be obtained by using digital photogrammetry technology. UAV-mounted remote sensing can obtain not only spectral data but, more importantly, vertical growth information on crops, such as crop height [27]. Crop height in turn may be used to estimate other crop parameters because it describes the vertical growth state of crops when traditional satellite optical remote sensing cannot [28].Numerous studies have used UAV-based remote-sensing data to estimate crop parameters [14,27,29,30]; they focus mostly on only CSMs or RGB-based VIs obtained from high-definition digital cameras to estimate crop parameters. The objectives of this study are thus to evaluate the performance of different sensors by use of CSMs, VIs, and combinations thereof to make multi-temporal estimates and maps of crop parameters. More specifically, we evaluate (i) the performance of crop parameters estimates by using near-surface spectroscopy (350~2500 nm, 3 nm at 700 nm, 8.5 nm at 1400 nm, 6.5 nm at 2100 nm), a UAV-mounted snapshot hyperspectral sensor (450~950 nm, 8 nm at 532 nm) and a high-definition digital camera (R, G, B); (ii) the crop surface models (CSMs), RGB-based VIs, hyperspectral-based VIs, and methods combined therefrom to make multi-temporal estimates of crop parameters and to map the parameters. Moreover, the estimated LAI and AGB are obtained by using linear and exponential equations, random forest (RF) regression, and partial least squares regression (PLSR) to combine the UAV based spectral VIs and crop heights (from the CSMs). This paper is structured as follows:(1)Section 2 presents the field sampling and treatment, the UAV remote-sensing data-acquisition methods, and the methods used to generate DOMs and CSMs. It also discusses the selection of VIs, data analysis, estimation methods, and statistical analysis.(2)Section 3 presents the results and the precision of the estimates of crop parameters (i) when using only RGB-based VIs and hyperspectral-based VIs; (ii) when using only crop height; (iii) when combining the VIs and crop height; and (iv) when combining the spectral VIs and crop height by using random forest regression and partial least squares regression.(3)Section 4 analyzes and compares the advantages and disadvantages of the four approaches detailed in Section 3. The advantages and disadvantages of remote sensing by UAV-mounted snapshot hyperspectral sensors and high-definition digital cameras are also discussed.(4)Finally, we discuss potential applications in agriculture of UAV-mounted snapshot hyperspectral sensors and high-definition digital cameras.", 1.

889,"Experiments were conducted at the Xiao Tangshan National Precision Agriculture Research Center of China, which is located in the Changping District (115°50′17″–116°29′49″E, 40°2′18″–40°23′13″N) of Beijing, China. The territory of Changping District is flat, with an average altitude of 36 m, and it has a warm temperate semi-humid continental monsoon climate. Changping District has an average low temperature of −10–7.5 °C, an average high temperature of 35–40 °C, and an annual rainfall of 450 mm (from China Meteorological Data Service, http://data.cma.cn/). The study site has fine-loamy soil.A total of three plant groups were selected for ground measurements during the winter wheat jointing, flagging, and flowering periods of 2015 (see Figure 1). Winter wheat was grown on 48 plots and different amounts of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation levels were used, as shown in Figure 1. We applied two winter wheat varieties ((1) J9843 (human selected type being), Beijing Municipal Bureau of Agriculture, China, and (2) ZM175 (human selected type being), Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China), three water treatments (W0 is rainfall only, W1 is rainfall plus 100 mm, and W2 is rainfall plus 200 mm), and four nitrogen treatments (N0 is no fertilizer, N1 is 195 kg/ha, N2 is 390 kg/ha, and N3 is 780 kg/ha).Three hyperspectral and high-definition digital images of winter wheat field were acquired by using a snapshot hyperspectral sensor and a high-definition digital camera mounted on a UAV. Ground hyperspectral data were collected by using a near-surface spectrometer. During the ground-measurement campaign, winter wheat LAI, AGB, and canopy height were also measured for each plot. Sensor parameters and data collection and processing methods are discussed in the following sections.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Experiments,2
890," 2.2.1. Measurement of Field Hyperspectral ReflectanceGround winter wheat canopy reflectance was measured by using an ASD Field Spec 3 spectrometer (Analytical Spectral Devices, Boulder, CO, USA). ASD Field Spec 3 spectrometer has a full-range detection capacity (350 nm to 2500 nm, spectral resolution: 3 nm at 700 nm, 8.5 nm at 1400 nm, 6.5 nm at 2100 nm) and provides uniform visible near-infrared shortwave infrared data collection over the entire solar spectrum. Data was resampled to 1 nm spacing automatically. Measurements were collected during the jointing (21 April 2015), flagging (26 April 2015), and flowering (13 May 2015) stages of winter wheat growth. After the UAV flight (from 11.00 h a.m. to 2.00 h p.m.), ground measurements were carried out under windless conditions and stable light levels. We calibrated the field spectrometer based on the reflectance from a 40 cm × 40 cm BaSO4 whiteboard. Winter wheat canopy reflectance was measured 10 times at the center of each plot, and the average reflectance was recorded. 2.2.2. Measurement of Crop HeightThe crop height was measured by using a straight measuring stick (crop height was from the ground to the highest part of the wheat plant). We measured three times at the center of each plot, and recorded the average reflectance. The sampling location was near the center of the plots, and 20 winter wheat plants growing close to the center were selected. After ground measurements, the winter wheat organs were processed in the laboratory. 2.2.3. Measurement of Leaf Area Index in LaboratoryIn the laboratory, all leaves were stuck onto A4-size paper and the total area of each leaf was measured by using an optical scanner. The winter wheat LAI was calculated as:

where S is the total area of all the leaves, n is the number of winter wheat ears per unit area, p is the number of select winter wheat plants (p = 20, in this study), and l is the row spacing (15 cm). 2.2.4. Measurement of Aboveground Biomass in LaboratoryAfter calculating the LAI, all the leaves and stems from each plot were put into paper bags together and dried at 80 °C to remove moisture. Once the sample weight became constant (about 24 h), they were weighed by using a balance with an accuracy of 0.001 g. Finally, the biomass per unit area was calculated based on the measured planting density and the dry weight of the sample. The winter wheat AGB was calculated by using:

895," 2.3.1. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, Snapshot Hyperspectral Sensor, and High-Definition Digital CameraAs UAV sensor platform, we used a DJI S1000 UAV (SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd., Sham Chun, China) with eight propellers, which is very stable at low flight speed and low altitude. When equipped with two 18,000 mAh (25 V) batteries, it runs for 30 min with a takeoff weight of 6 kg, a flying altitude of 50 m, and a flight speed of 8 m/s.The Sony DSC–QX100 (Sony DSC–QX100, Sony, Tokyo, Japan) is a high-definition digital camera (Table 1) with a short exposure and integration time. It weighs 0.18 kg and measures 63 × 63 × 56 mm3. It provides digital number (DN) values in the visible (spectral: R, G, B).The UHD 185 Firefly (UHD 185 firefly, Cubert GmbH, Ulm, Baden-Württemberg, Germany) is a snapshot hyperspectral sensor (Table 1). The UHD 185 has a short exposure and integration time, weighs 0.47 kg, and measures 195 × 67 × 60 mm3. Its operating range spans from the visible to the near-infrared (wavelength range: 450 nm to 950 nm, 8 nm @ 532 nm, Table 1). Hyperspectral data cubes were automatically resampled to 4 nm spacing. Collected radiation is recorded as a 1000 × 1000 (1 band) panchromatic image and a 50 × 50 (125 bands) hyperspectral cube. Because the acquired panchromatic images are rich in texture information, and stitching is relatively simple; and the 50 × 50 (125 bands) hyperspectral cubes are characterized by rich spectral information, but lack texture information, hyperspectral image fusion was used to splice the UHD 185 hyperspectral images. The fusion steps are implemented in Cubert Cube-Pilot software (Cube-Pilot, Version 1.4, Cubert GmbH, Ulm, Baden-Württemberg, Germany). After fusion, all hyperspectral images with 1000 × 1000 (125 bands) were stitched together using an image stitching process. 2.3.2. Radiometric CalibrationFlights were conducted during the jointing (21 April 2015), flagging (26 April 2015), and flowering (13 May 2015) stages of winter wheat, with the UAV carrying a UHD 185 snapshot hyperspectral sensor (abbreviated as UAV-UHD) and a Sony DSC–QX100 high-definition digital camera (abbreviated as UAV-DC). The UAV-UHD and UAV-DC images were obtained at 50 m altitude and during stable light conditions, so atmospheric correction was not required. The UHD 185 and Sony DSC–QX100 exposure times were fixed depending on the intensity of sun light.The UHD 185 was calibrated on the ground before the UAV flight by using Cubert Cube-Pilot software (Version 1.4) and a BaSO4 whiteboard. The original DN values of the UAV-DC images were calibrated by imaging a black-and-white fabric placed on the ground and using

Generating Digital Orthophotos Maps and Crop Surface ModelsSnapshot hyperspectral and high-definition digital images were mosaicked together to obtain a panoramic hyperspectral and digital orthophotos maps (DOM) for an entire area. This is typically accomplished by using structure-from-motion photogrammetry, which is a process for extracting geometric structures from camera images taken from different camera stations. A digital surface model (DSM) is a simulation of a terrain’s surface in which is recorded information about the field and crop. The main steps to generate a DOM and DSM from hyperspectral and high-definition digital images are as follows:(1)Extract feature points by using the scale-invariant feature transform algorithm(2)Match features(3)Apply the structure-from-motion algorithm and a bundle-block adjustment to recover the image poses and build sparse three-dimensional (3D) feature point(4)Build dense 3D point clouds from camera poses estimated from Step (3) and sparse 3D feature points by using the multi-view stereo algorithm(5)Build a 3D polygonal mesh of the object surface based on the dense cloud.These steps are implemented in PhotoScan from Agisoft (Agisoft PhotoScan Professional Pro, Version 1.1.6, Agisoft LLC, 11 Degtyarniy per., St. Petersburg, Russia, hereinafter referred to as PhotoScan). Executing these steps produces a DOM and the corresponding DSM of each flight.The CSM is generated by subtracting the digital elevation model (DEM) from DSM (DEM represents the variations of field soils under crops). The main steps to generate DEMs, CSMs, and UAV-based crop height from DSMs are as follows:(1)In total of 279 soil point coordinates were recorded by using the ARCGIS software (ARCGIS, Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc., Redlands, CA, USA) and DSM, and then using the ARCGIS extract tools and DSM to obtain the elevation of each soil point.(2)The field DEM is obtained by interpolating the surface elevation between soil points by using the ARCGIS kriging tools.(3)The CSM of winter wheat is calculated by using the ARCGIS raster calculator tools.(4)The crop height of each plot is obtained by using the ARCGIS ROI tools.Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the UAV-UHD hyperspectral images, high-definition digital camera images and corresponding crop height maps of three plant groups for three growing periods. The increase in canopy coverage appear clearly in Figure 2 (from Figure 2a,c,e) and Figure 3 (from Figure 3a,c,e).

Previous studies show that RF and PLSR are powerful for dealing with multicollinearity problems, so we also used RF and PLSR. PLSR is a data-analysis method proposed by Wold [38] and has been widely used in studies involving remote sensing in agricultural because it offers powerful empirical regression techniques that make full use of input data to monitor agricultural crop parameters. Random forest is a data analysis and statistical method for classification and regression proposed by Breiman and Cutler [39]. In recent years, RF has been widely used in machine-learning research. It operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees. RF has a higher accuracy, better tolerance to outliers and noise, and makes excellent use of the input data.Above-ground biomass and leaf area index estimation models (RF and PLSR) calibration and validation were done by using MATLAB software. The parameters of RF were optimized by using the method from Yue et al. [7]. The tree number was set to 800, and parameter mtry was set to 6 for the entire growth periods. 2.4.3. Statistical AnalysisWith three measurements, we acquired a total of 144 datasets. Two groups of data (Groups 2 and 3, in Figure 1, used as the calibration set) were used to analyze the relationship between spectral, DSM, and combined information and AGB and LAI. Group 1 was used as the validation set. After data analysis, we used 96 sets of data to build the models and 48 setsdatas to validate the models. In this study, the correlation analysis was done by using the statistical software R 3.5.0 and calibration set.The coefficient of determination R2, root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (nRMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate the performance of each model. Mathematically, a higher R2 corresponds to a smaller RMSE, nRMSE and MAE, and thus represents better model accuracy. The following equations were used to calculate R2, RMSE, nRMSE and MAE:

Two groups of data (Groups 2 and 3, in Figure 1, used as the calibration set) were used to analyze the relationship between spectral, DSM, and combined information and AGB and LAI. Group 1 was used as the validation set. After data analysis, we used 96 sets of data to build the models and 48 setsdatas to validate the models. In this study, the correlation analysis was done by using the statistical software R 3.5.0 and calibration set.The coefficient of determination R2, root mean square error (RMSE), normalized root mean square error (nRMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were used to evaluate the performance of each model. Mathematically, a higher R2 corresponds to a smaller RMSE, nRMSE and MAE, and thus represents better model accuracy. The following equations were used to calculate R2, RMSE, nRMSE and MAE:

903,"Figure 4a,b shows the mean hyperspectral reflectance spectra of the winter wheat canopy at three growing stages. The hyperspectral reflectance in the near-infrared bands (about 800 to 1000 nm) first increases and then decreases as winter wheat grows. However, this trend does not appear in the data acquired by the high-definition digital camera (Figure 4c) calibrated by DN values because they do not cover the near-infrared bands. As winter wheat grows, the crop height increases. The ground-measured crop height (Figure 4d) exceeds the UAV-measured crop height (Figure 4e,f). However, the two results for UAV-measured crop heights are similar (Figure 4e,f).Figure 5 shows the Pearson correlation coefficient between AGB, LAI, VI and crop height. For each VI, crop height, AGB and LAI, a square of varying size and color represents the corresponding Pearson correlation coefficient. The Pearson correlation coefficient indicates that a positive correlation exists between crop height, SPVI, LCI, NDVI, OSAVI, EVI2, and BGI (Figure 5a). The results also indicate that a negative correlation exists between crop height, MCARI, and NPCI (Figure 5b). For VIs built from high-definition digital images, crop height correlates positively to r, R/G, and EXR, but negatively to b, B/R, B/G, VARI and GRVI (Figure 5c). The results in Figure 5 indicate that the measured VIs are correlated to varying degrees with AGB and LAI. Crop heights (H) are positively correlate with AGB but uncorrelated with LAI in three growing stages. VIs are highly correlated with LAI in three growing stages, for example, NDVI, LCI, OSAVI, etc. Most red and near-infrared-based spectral VIs have a low correlation with AGB in three growing stages; for example, NDVI, LCI, NPCI, OSAVI, etc. However, the R, G, B based VIs are highly correlated with AGB; for example, b, r, VARI. Sensitivity analyses indicated that multi-temporal spectral VIs based AGB estimation may inefficiently. Single- and multi-temporal estimates of AGB and LAI estimation are analyzed in the next section.", 3. Results and Analysis, 3.1. Spectral and Crop Height,3
904," 3.2.1. Relationships between Vegetation Indices and Leaf Area Index and Above-Ground BiomassWe used linear and nonlinear regression analysis to investigate VIs with Equations (4) and (5). The best VIs and equations (Table 4) were selected based on growing stages and remote-sensing data (G-VIs, DC-VIs, and UHD-VIs). Good relationships between VIs and LAI and AGB were obtained and the regression equations of LAI and AGB were built for winter wheat (see Table 4).The regression equations for LAI and AGB were validated using the calibration datasets, and the resulting R2, MAE, and RMSE are shown in Table 4 and in Figure 6a–c and Figure 7a–c. For the LAI estimated for three growth stages, the RMSEs range from 0.88 to 1.01, the MAEs range from 0.67 to 0.80, and R2 ranges from 0.46 to 0.59. For AGB estimated over the three growth stages, the RMSEs range from 1.71 to 2.25 t/ha, the MAEs range from 1.19 to 1.88 t/ha, and R2 ranges from 0.26 to 0.67.All G-VIs, DC-VIs, and UHD-VIs give good results for a single growing stage. However, the precision decreases when data from all three growing stages are used in the modeling. The results show that G-VIs are effective for estimating LAI and AGB in the jointing and flagging stages, but DC-VIs are more effective for estimating LAI and AGB in the flowering stage and over all three stages. The results show that the best G-VIs for estimating LAI or AGB vary over the different growing stages. However, the best G-VI for estimating LAI and AGB give the same results for both single growth stages and over all three growth stages.Figure 6a–c shows the relationship between best VIs and AGB, and the associated validation accuracy of the three sensors. Figure 7a–c shows the relationship between best VIs and LAI, and the associated validation accuracy of the three sensors. LCI (Table 4 and Figure 6a,b) performs best in estimating LAI and AGB among eight investigated VIs. However, the relationship between LCI and LAI are much better than that of AGB (Figure 7a,b). LCI have a similar range in multi-temporal when AGB keeps increasing (Figure 6a,b). During reproductive growth (flowering), photosynthetic products are mostly stored in reproductive organs (e.g., flower and ear of wheat), but are mostly stored in stems and leaves during vegetative growth. Thus, it is difficult to monitor AGB by only use spectral VIs (Table 4 and Figure 6a,b). 3.2.2. Relationships between (i) Crop Height and (ii) Leaf Area Index and Above-Ground BiomassData for three single growing stages and all three growing stages were used to evaluate the relationships between crop height and LAI and AGB. We applied a linear and nonlinear regression analysis to investigate VIs by using Equations (4)–(9). The results indicate a low correlation between crop height and LAI and AGB for single growing stages, especially for the jointing stage. A good correlation exists between crop height and AGB when using data from the three growing stages (see Table 5 and Figure 6d–f). However, because of low relativity, it is difficult to directly use crop height to estimate LAI when the data cover multiple growing periods (see Table 5 and Figure 7d–f).The regression equations for LAI and AGB are validated by using the calibration datasets, and the resulting R2, MAE, and RMSE are shown in Table 5 and Figure 6 and Figure 7. To estimate AGB over all three stages, the results show that the RMSEs range from 1.00 to 1.08 t/ha, the MAEs range from 1.39 to 1.49 t/ha, and R2 ranges from 0.71 to 0.75.Figure 6d–f shows the relationship between crop height and AGB, and the associated validation accuracy of the three sensors. The results (Figure 6d–f) indicate that crop height keeps increasing with AGB in multi-temporal mode. Thus, crop height can be used for multi-temporal AGB estimation. More importantly, crop height (Table 5) performs better in estimating AGB among all investigated VIs (Table 4). Figure 7d–f shows the relationship between crop height and LAI, and the associated validation accuracy of the three sensors. The results (Figure 7d–f and Table 5) indicate that crop height is weakly correlated with LAI, especially in multi-temporal mode. 3.2.3. Relationships between Crop Height and Vegetation Indices and Leaf Area Index and Above-Ground BiomassWe apply a linear and nonlinear regression analysis to investigate crop height and selected VIs by using Equations (6)–(9). The selected VIs are obtained from Table 4, and the equations are given in Table 6.The regression equations for LAI and AGB are validated using the calibration datasets, and the resulting R2, MAE, and RMSE are given in Table 6 and in Figure 6g–i and Figure 7g–i. The results show that the combined VIs and crop height methods cannot improve the precision of the estimate of LAI (Table 6) and that, furthermore, the crop height determined by combining ASD-based LCI is more effective for estimating AGB over all three growing stages with ground validation R2 = 0.26~0.81, MAE = 1.88 to 0.99, and RMSE = 2.25 to 1.32. In addition, for UHD-height validation, R2 = 0.30~0.74, MAE = 1.84 to 1.05, and RMSE = 2.18 to 1.38. The results of the UAV-DC method also improved, with R2 = 0.67 to 0.77, MAE = 1.19 to 1.02, and RMSE = 1.71 to 1.30.In this study, VIs from three sensors (Table 1) were individually combined with crop height to analyze the relationships of height × VIs with LAI and AGB. The relationship between crop height × VIs and AGB of the three sensors are shown in Figure 6g–i. The results (Figure 6g–i and Table 6) indicate that AGB estimation accuracy can be improved by multiplying crop height by a VI. Thus, the height × VI regression equation for estimating AGB is fit to power regression equations. To estimate LAI, we find that crop height × VI is weakly correlated with LAI in multi-temporal estimation (Figure 7g–i and Table 6). In addition, the height × VI based LAI estimation accuracies is also lower than that obtained by only using VIs in single stages.", 3. Results and Analysis," 3.2.

The VIs based on AGB modeling have the best R2 values of 0.93 (RF: MAE = 0.52, RMSE = 0.72, nRMSE = 13.22%) and 0.61 (PLSR: MAE = 1.19, RMSE = 1.62, nRMSE = 29.76%).

Table A1 ranks the predictor variables according to their importance in AGB and LAI estimation.Table 8 shows AGB and LAI estimates based on crop height and VIs and using the RF and PLSR methods.

Figure 8 and Figure 9 show the relationships (fitting formula: y = ax + b, R2, MAE, and RMSE) between the predicted and measured winter wheat AGB and LAI. The results show that the methods based on crop height and VIs provide better estimates of AGB than those based only on VIs (Figure 8). More importantly, all results based on crop height and VIs fit better (their slopes a are closer to unity; see Figure 8). As is the case for the LAI modeling dataset, the relationship in Figure 9 indicates that no notable difference exists between methods based on crop height and VIs and those based only on VIs.The results thus indicate that the PLSR and RF techniques could be used to improve the accuracy of estimates of AGB and LAI (Table 7 and Table 8) compared with that available with single VIs (Table 4), crop height (Table 5), or simple combinations thereof (Table 6).", 3.

909,"We estimate the spatial distribution of AGB (Figure 10) based on all UHD and DC VIs, crop height, and using PLSR. The spatial distributions of UHD-based AGB maps (Figure 10a–c) are similar to those of UHV-DC (Figure 10d–f). An increase in AGB occurred from 21 April to 13 May 2015 (Figure 10). The averaged UHD-based AGB maps range from 3.05 t/ha (21 April) to 5.84 t/ha (26 April) to 7.86 t/ha (13 May). The average DC-based AGB maps range from 3.30 t/ha (21 April) to 6.49 t/ha (26 April) to 8.46 t/ha (13 May). The present AGB maps indicate that the AGB of most plant plots is less than 6 t/ha on 21 April; however, most plots exceed 6 t/ha on 26 April, and almost all plant plots have AGB >6 t/ha on 13 May. These mapping results are consistent with our field observations (Table 3) and with precision evaluation (Figure 8).The spatial distribution of the LAI (Figure 11) is estimated based on all UHD and DC VIs and by using PLSR. The UHD-based LAI maps are shown in Figure 11a–c, when DC-based LAI maps are shown in Figure 11d–f. From 21 April to 26, both UHD (from 2.95 to 3.35) and DC (from 3.06 to 3.54) LAI maps show that the LAI increased in all plots. However, the averaged LAI decreased from 26 April to 13 May (UHD map: 3.07, DC map: 2.91). These results are consistent with our field observations (Table 3) and with precision evaluation (Figure 9).", 3. Results and Analysis, 3.4. Mapping Leaf Area Index and Above-Ground Biomass,3
910,"From 21 April to 26 April, the averaged LAI increased in all plots but decreased from 26 April to 13 May (Table 3 and Figure 10 and Figure 11). In the current study, both UAV-UHD and G-ASD mean hyperspectral reflectance spectra of winter wheat canopy first increased and then decrease (Figure 4), which is consistent with field measurements of LAI. The present results suggest that the LAI can be accurately estimated using single VIs in specific, single growing stages and multi- growing stages (Table 4). Our results suggest that the AGB can be accurately estimated by using single VIs in single growing stages (Table 4). However, we also found AGB changes (Table 3 and Figure 10 and Figure 11) do not match the spectral changes (Figure 4a,b) in multi-temporal mode. During reproductive growth (flowering), photosynthetic products are mostly stored in reproductive organs (e.g., flower and ear of wheat), but were mostly stored in stems and leaves during vegetative growth (Jointing and Flagging) [40]. Therefore, it is difficult to use the traditional VIs based on red and near-infrared bands to estimate multi-temporal AGB.In addition, many VIs saturate when used to estimate crop parameters because they are not very sensitive for medium-to-high canopy cover [24,41]. From the jointing stage to the flagging and flowering stages, the winter wheat canopy coverage increases continuously, and estimates of the LAI and AGB face different canopy coverage. The changes of VIs for estimating winter wheat LAI and AGB are correlated with the dry matter, pigment, and water content [18,42]. This means the sensitivity of VIs depends on the growing stage of winter wheat. Therefore, identifying the optimized predictor variables is crucial for estimating crop parameters based on remote-sensing data, and also helps us select the suitable sensors.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Leaf Area Index and Above-Ground Biomass Estimation Using Vegetation Indices,4
911,"Crop height can be used to estimate AGB at medium-to-high canopy coverage because crop height describes the vertical-growth state [26,43]. The present results indicate that the accuracy of AGB estimates based on crop height for single growing stages is worse than that based on spectral VIs. However, the overall modeling accuracy is greatly improved. This shows that crop vertical growth has a greater effect for estimating AGB over multiple growing stages. In the current study, the VIs and crop height are simply multiplied to estimate the AGB of winter wheat. The combined height and VIs provides better estimates of winter wheat AGB than do single VIs or crop height (Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6). Possoch et al. [30] and Yue et al. [44] reported that the drawbacks of crop height and VIs can be diminished when they are combined for modeling. The better performance of height × VI for estimating AGB over multiple growing stages is attributed to the capacity of crop height to describe vertical growth at medium-to-high canopy cover. Furthermore, the values predicted when using only spectral VIs are underestimated when AGB >6 t/ha (Figure 8c,d,g,h,k,l). This is because the spectral VIs lose sensitivity for estimating AGB in the later winter wheat growing stages when building estimation models based on multiple growing stages [44,45]. The addition of crop height makes up for the shortcomings of only spectral VIs. In addition, the advantages of spectral VIs and CSMs combine to further improve their value for applications, which will enhance the development of snapshot-sensor technology. This is because CSMs can be generated from inexpensive snapshot-sensor images.The present results also indicate that height × VIs does not provide reasonable estimates of winter wheat LAI over multiple growing stages. From jointing to flagging and flowering growing stages, our field investigation indicates that the LAI increases and then decreases as the crop height increases (Table 3). Therefore, crop height (CSM) correlates poorly with the LAI for models spanning all three winter wheat growing stages. The present study uses the RF and PLSR to combine spectral VI and CSM remote-sensing data for estimating crop parameters and mapping the spatial distribution of winter wheat AGB and LAI. The result suggests that combining multiple types of remote sensing data (spectral and CSM data) using RF or PLSR is appropriate for estimating winter wheat AGB and LAI. The accuracy of the estimates of LAI and AGB is better when using RF and PLSR (Table 7 and Table 8) than when using linear and exponential estimates (Table 6). These results are consistent with those of Refs. [46,47,48], which suggest that estimation accuracy can be improved with PLSR and RF. The present results also prove that RF and PLSR can be used to combine multiple types of remote-sensing data (spectral and CSM data) to estimate AGB of winter wheat.Compared with validation results using modeling (Table 7 and Table 8) and a calibration dataset (Figure 8 and Figure 9), PLSR provides better stability than RF. Overfitting may influence RF estimates of AGB and LAI for a small number of samples. Therefore, we use PLSR to map AGB and LAI.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Leaf Area Index and Above-Ground Biomass Estimation Using Vegetation Indices and Crop Height,4
912,"The present results indicate that AGB can be accurately estimated by combining crop height and VIs generated from UAV-based snapshot hyperspectral sensors and high-definition digital cameras. In addition, no significant difference appears in the estimates of LAI when using only VIs or when combining VIs and crop height. The present results indicate that LAI can be properly estimated over multiple growing stages when using hyperspectral VIs and RF or PLSR. Ranking LAI estimates from best to worst gives ground-spectrometer, UAV snapshot hyperspectral sensor, and UAV high-definition digital camera. This ranking matches the spectral performance of the three sensors; thus the spectral performance of sensors may be crucial for estimating LAI over multiple growing stages. These results suggest that winter wheat LAI cannot be properly estimated using only CSMs (crop height) for multiple growing stages in Changping District, Beijing, China. Future studies are needed to verify these results for different crops and different locations.", 4. Discussion, 4.3.

913,"This study compared ground spectrometer data with remote-sensing data from UAV-based snapshot hyperspectral sensors and high-definition digital cameras for estimating winter wheat LAI and AGB. Leaf area index and above-ground biomass were estimated by combining the spectral VIs and crop height (CSMs) via linear and exponential equations, RF, and PLSR.(i)We found that the correlation between the VIs × height (G-height × LCI, DC-height × r and UHD-height × LCI) and AGB is much greater than that when using a single VI or just the crop height. The results indicate that the combined use of VIs and crop height (CSMs) provides more accurate estimates of winter wheat AGB.(ii)The combined methods (VIs × height) to estimate AGB from UAV-mounted snapshot hyperspectral sensors and high-definition digital cameras provide an accuracy similar to that obtained when using a ground spectrometer to collect the data.(iii)The winter wheat LAI cannot be properly estimated using crop height over three growing stages. The results suggest that crop height is not a key variable for estimating wheat LAI when using remote-sensing data from all three growing stages. Therefore, the spectral performance of the sensors is crucial for estimating LAI over multiple growing stages. Ranking the LAI estimates from most to least accurate gives ground spectrometer, UAV snapshot hyperspectral sensor, UAV high-definition digital camera.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
914,"Wildfires burn heterogeneously through forested landscapes; while some patches may have the trees barely scorched, others will have severe damage in their canopies, with all leaves and small branches fully burned. The degree of consumption of the plant canopies has been used as a surrogate measure of fire severity, alone or in combination with other metrics related to it (e.g., ash color, height of scorch, soil mineral exposure, etc.) [1,2,3]. Fire severity is closely related to carbon emissions during fire [4,5,6], and is an important driver of fire impacts on the ecosystem [7,8]. Moreover, fire severity heterogeneity across the landscape can be a major factor for the functioning of the ecosystem, and confers resilience and resistance to large fire impacts [9]. Consequently, accurate estimates of fire severity and its spatial distribution are key factors to quantify fire impacts [10,11,12,13,14]. Moreover, fire severity varies at all scales; thus high-resolution information is needed to better estimate and model fire effects on basic ecosystem processes like postfire C and N dynamics [15].Optical remotely sensed imagery has been used since long ago to characterize fire severity [16]. However, this technique is hampered by the lack of 3D information to allow assessing the structural changes caused by fires in plants [17,18,19]. In addition, optical sensors have significant limitations with increasing aboveground biomass and leaf area index (LAI) [20,21], underestimating the fine-grain heterogeneity in fire severity [11,22,23]. LiDAR (light detection and ranging) has the potential to penetrate the forest canopy, emerging as a powerful active remote sensing tool for the direct 3D measurement of plant structures, including canopy structures, at a fine-grained scale [20,24,25,26,27]. It also allows for calibrating the reflectance-based spectral indices with specific plant structures, which can improve their accuracy and spatial resolution [17,28,29].While LiDAR has been used more extensively to characterize forest fire effects at the stand level (ABA: area-based approach) [11,12,18,30,31], relatively fewer studies have used LiDAR data to characterize crown damage after fires at the individual tree level (tree-based) [13,14,23,32]. LiDAR based methods at tree level [33,34,35,36,37] provide a means to assess forest structure and patterns using metrics that are both ecologically meaningful and management-relevant for fire management (e.g., canopy fuel load [38] and prediction of fire risk [39]). Nevertheless, there are important technical limitations of the studies at tree-level [36,37].Small-footprint LiDAR systems, with high pulse density, provide a solution for some tree-level limitations such as the underestimation of small trees and understory vegetation (e.g., [40,41,42]), and also allow the production of vertical foliage profiles for each individual tree [43]. The vertical canopy profile (VCP) is often represented by the vertical distribution of the leaf area density (LAD) in horizontal layers [44]. The vertical integration of the LAD profile data yields the leaf area index (LAI). These attributes are able to distinguish different fire damage levels [25,32] and reveal ecologically relevant differences in LAD profiles for different forests, including those with LAI values above 5.0 [24,45]. Recently, voxel-based canopy profiling (VxCP) has been applied for estimating LAD profiles and LAI with the reduced effects of non-uniformity in the foliage distribution and of non-photosynthetic tissue (e.g., [43,46]). The VxCP method divides the 3D space into ‘volume elements’ (voxels) that are 3D pixels. The ratio of pulses departing to pulses entering each voxel provides a measurement of the absorbance of vegetation within the voxel, from which the LAD can be estimated [43,44,47].Apart from LAI–LAD profiles, other LiDAR-derived VCP metrics, such as the profile area under the canopy, have been applied to assess post-fire forest structures at the area level [17,19] and in a multitemporal way (profile area change), to quantify biomass loss at the tree level [14]. Moreover, the VCP approach based on height and intensity standard metrics has been used to characterize the post-fire crown structure and crown fire severity [13], or to estimate biomass in burned areas [19]. In addition, VCPs have been pursued to identify tree properties, such as the LiDAR-derived canopy base height (CBH), using inflection points from fitted mathematical functions [13,38,48,49].Another advantage of the VCP lies in its robustness for multiscale applications. The VCP can be calculated either at the tree-based or the area-based level [14,50]. The VCPs have been applied at the area-based scale to predict the time since fire (TSF) of the vegetation [51], to characterize vertical vegetation structures for a wide range of burned areas, using metrics derived from GLAS satellites (LiDAR full waveform pulses) [52], to characterize post-fire effects on the height and density of the vegetation [17], or to estimate the plot-level above-ground biomass (AGB) in burned plots [19]. In other cases, VCPs were calculated at the tree level, and later aggregated at the plot scale (e.g., [38]) to calculate fuel load. Nevertheless, the integration of optical remotely sensed imagery and LiDAR data provides more accurate information than either sensor type alone for classifying post-fire residual vegetation [11,12] or crown severity levels [13].In this paper, we characterize the fine-grained tree structures, including their canopies, of trees in a large Pinus halepensis-dominated fire that occurred in south-eastern Spain (Yeste, Albacete) in the summer of 2017. We classified the damages to each individual tree by using LiDAR metrics derived from vertical canopy profiles (VCP). Our main objective was to characterize tree morphologies (from LiDAR) and verify the differences that exist in them after fire in relation to fire severity levels based on Sentinel 2A RBR metrics. More specifically, we evaluated the following: (i) which structural metrics (LiDAR-derived) are most important for separating individual trees into distinct groups, (ii) how these tree groups are distributed within fire severity categories, and also (iii) how these groups are related to RBR Sentinel 2A fire severity levels (how different were tree groups among them within each fire severity level, and how different were tree groups within them across different fire severity levels).The main novelties of this work are as follows: (i) the use of different approaches (i.e., voxels, height bins and original points) to estimate vertical crown profile metrics at the tree level; (ii) using LAD profiles and LAI values to estimate crown properties; (iii) using the breakpoints method to calculate the canopy base height (CBH) for deriving the crown volume, and (iv) using multitemporal passive optical multispectral imagery to relate spectral fire severity indices with LiDAR data.", 1.

915,"The study area was the Yeste fire (province of Albacete, SE Spain), that occurred in summer 2017. The fire started on 27th July, one day before an incursion of warm, tropical Africa air, and was controlled on August 1st, after burning 3217 ha (see [53] for further details). High-density LiDAR flights were carried out six months after the fire on three areas of 5–6 ha size with different levels of fire severity and in an unburned area adjacent to the fire (Figure 1a). The unburned area was occupied by Pinus halepensis Mill. (60%) and shrublands. The low severity area was occupied by mixed Pinus pinaster Ait. and Pinus halepensis Mill. (74%) forests and open forests of Juniperus oxycedrus L. with Pinus halepensis Mill., and the moderate severity area was completely occupied by Pinus halepensis Mill. Forest. The highest fire severity area was entirely occupied by mixed Pinus pinaster Ait. and Pinus halepensis Mill. forest. The elevation ranges from 722 m to 1112 m and the slope from 14.6° to 20° across the four areas. Crosstabulation between LiDAR flights and RBR Sentinel 2A fire severity categories allowed us to broadly characterize each LiDAR flight regarding the distribution of RBR fire severity levels (Figure 1b).", 2. Methods, 2.1. Study Sites,2
916,"Post-fire high-density LiDAR data were acquired using the TerraSystem-Lidarpod system formed by the Velodyne HDL-32e sensor with a range distance of 110 m. This system has 32 pairs of laser sensors (wavelength of 905 nm) with a rotation rate of 100 Hz, and dual-sensor first and last returns, collecting a total of 700,000 pulses per second. The average pulse spacing was between 0.01 and 0.04 m. The flights were made at an altitude of 40 m above the ground (footprint on the ground was 33 × 204 m), and in parallel lines 40 m apart with an overlap of 50%. The flight speed was between 5 and 7 m/s. At this flight height, the spatial distance (spacing) among points was 0.05 m, with a mean density of 300 points m−2. The horizontal accuracy was <2 cm and the vertical accuracy <10 cm [54]. 2.2.1. LiDAR Pre-ProcessingThe first step consisted in aligning forward and backward flight trajectories from the unprocessed Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data and raw advanced navigation files from the Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) (.anpp) using the Kinematica software [55]. Later, in the LasTools software [56], point clouds were filtered to eliminate duplicates and isolated points.Next, ground returns were classified using the progressive Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) (i.e., a Delaunay TIN) densification algorithm implemented in the lasground function of the LasTools software, using as parameters (i) the terrain type (-wilderness) with a step size of 6 m and (ii) the granularity (‘-hyper_fine’). Moreover, we fine-tuned the algorithm by specifying (i) a threshold in meters at which spikes are removed from the ground (3 m), and (ii) the maximal offset in meters (0.05 m) up to which points above the current ground estimate are included. Once the points were classified as “ground or not ground”, the ellipsoidal heights of the point clouds were transformed into orthometric heights, using the geoid file from the National Geographic Institute (NGI) [57]. After that, the orthometric height was normalized so that the height of the vegetation that was above the ground line (0 m) could be obtained (Figure 2). Finally, using the normalized LiDAR cloud, the canopy height model (CHM) was produced with a 0.1 m resolution. 2.2.2. Tree Detection and Vertical Canopy Profiles (VCP)CHM, individual tree detection and crown metrics computation were performed using the LidR package [58] in the R software [59] in four steps (Figure 3). First, we applied a “spike-free” algorithm [60] to build the CHM at 0.1 m pixel. This method resolves the problem of the empty pixels and so-called “pits” by the interpolation of first returns with a TIN, and then rasterizing it onto a grid. It consisted of several layers of triangulation at different height bins (at 0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 m). Moreover, the pit-free algorithm combined with the subcircling tweak, which replaces each return with a circle with a small radius (i.e., option ‘-subcircle 0.25′), worked adequately without empty pixels or pits. This algorithm is implemented with the ‘grid_canopy’ function in the LidR package [58] in R software [59]. Afterwards, the CHM was smoothed using a Gaussian filter (window size of 3 × 3 and a sigma value of 0.5). Second, individual trees were detected from the smoothed CHM, applying a tree detection algorithm based on a local maxima filter using a moving window of 3 × 3 m and 4 m as the minimum tree height. Third, crown segmentation was achieved based on local maxima plus Voronoi tessellation, using a threshold of 4 m, following Silva’s method (see [61] for further details), and the computed maximum height (tree height) and crown area (CrArea, m2) in the same R package (Table 1). Finally, we delineated crown contours using the raster R package [62]. The fourth step consisted of clipping all the returns of the normalized heights within simplified crowns to obtain the following (Table 1): (i) cloud metrics (standard height and intensity distribution metrics), including all height values and for two vegetation strata (<4 m and >4 m), and the density of different vegetation layers using raw points; (ii) diversity metrics derived from the density of height bins at 0.5 m from the ground up to 20 m (i.e., Simpson and Shannon diversity indices, and evenness dominance indices), using the Biodiversity R package ([63]); and (iii) leaf area density (LAD, leaf area contained in unit crown volume) profiles based on voxels using the LeafR package [47] (Figure 3 and Table 1).Tree delineation validation in the field was carried out on four plots of 30 m diameter, located randomly in the moderate fire severity LiDAR flights. We located LiDAR-derived tree crowns (≥4 m) in the field, using the X,Y position of the treetops of each crown segment. The locations of the treetops of selected trees were recorded using a Trimble Geo 7x (Sunnyvale, CA, USA), with post sampling corrections performed by the GPS provider. We measured the diameter at breast height (DBH) for each tree (n = 113). The height of the trees was not measured in the field. We identified 100% of the trees selected from LiDAR in the field. Moreover, we found a very good match between the tree crowns delineated by low-density pre-fire LiDAR data [53] and the post-fire crown segments (Figure S1). Finally, we related field-estimated DBH with the LiDAR-estimated tree height and crown area to assess the coherence of the results (Figure S2). In this study, we have tested various segmentation algorithms (i.e., watershed, Dalponte and Lee using LidR package in R software), and we have ascertained that Silva’s tree segmentation [61] algorithm was better than the other ones because it did not merge so many adjacent trees together. Overall, the tree delineation was successful where the trees were more dispersed and thinner, such as in more severely burned areas [13,30,61,64]. 2.2.3. LAI and LAD ProfilesBased on vertical profiles of the heights within each crown polygon, we calculated LAD profiles and LAI values, following the methodology proposed by Almeida [47] (Figure 4). The point cloud of each tree was binned into voxels (canopy volume units) with an XYZ resolution fixed at 1 × 1 × 1 m. For each voxel, we calculated the number of pulses that entered and the number of pulses that passed through that voxel. Next, the MacArthur–Horn equation was applied to each voxel to compute its LAD (LADi). From the LAD profiles, the total LAI (the sum of LAD from 1 m height to the top of the tree), the relative understory LAI (percentage of the total LAI from 0 to 3 m) and the crown LAI (total LAI—absolute understory LAI) of each tree were obtained (Figure 4 and Table 1). Since we only used points with a maximum of 15° off-nadir view, we could work under the assumption that each LiDAR pulse was vertically incident (see Almeida [47] for further details).Based on the LAD profiles within each crown polygon, we detected inflection points (i.e., break points [BP]) using the breakpoints function from the strucchange package [65] in R, and derived crown base height (CBH, m) (Figure 4). This step eliminates the influence of stems and understory vegetation from crown LAD profiles. We derived the minimum (out-min) and maximum (out-max) height values around each BP. The minimum height (min-out) of the first BP with LAD values > 0 was considered the minimum CBH (minCBH), whereas the minimum height (min-out) of the BP with the maximum LAD (>p90 LAD) was identified as the maximum CBH (maxCBH). With the height values of minCBH and maxCBH and the maximum height (tree height), we derived crown lengths, and using the crown area (CrArea) we calculated two crown volumes (min and max CrVol, m3), although here we only show results from the max CrVol (Figure 4).", 2.

920,"Two Sentinel 2 MSI images, captured on 18th July 2017 (pre-fire) and 14th August 2017 (immediately post-fire), were downloaded from the Copernicus open access hub server at the processing level L1C [66]. Correction of the images for surface reflectivity (level L2A) (hereafter ‘Sentinel 2A’) was performed using the Sen2Cor processing tool in SNAP 6.0 software [67]. All bands were resampled to 10 m pixel resolution, using the reference band B2, and a water and cloud mask, available for each scene in SNAP 6.0, were overlaid [53].We used the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) to calculate the Relativized Burnt Ratio (RBR) = (dNBR/(NBR prefire + 1.001)) ([68]), which was the spectral fire severity index most related to field-based fire severity measures (see [53] for further details). Three fire severity levels were established based on RBR thresholds (i.e., <0.3, 0.3–0.5 and >0.5), following the results obtained by Viedma [53].", 2. Methods, 2.3. RBR Sentinel 2 Fire Severity Index,2
921,"To classify fire severity we used the hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC) approach, which allows one to combine three standard methods commonly used in multivariate data analyses: (i) principal component analysis (PCA), (ii) hierarchical clustering and (iii) partitioning clustering (i.e., k-means method). The algorithm of the HCPC method was implemented in the FactoMineR package [69] in R software. The first step consisted of PCA calculation, which is very useful for analyzing large data sets with multiple variables (n = 4711 and 49 LiDAR-derived explanatory variables, described in Table 1). PCA was calculated on standardized variables by z scores (mean 0 and standard deviation 1), and we checked that all PCA assumptions were not violated (i.e., continuous observations, linear relationship between all variables [See Figure S2], large enough sample sizes, and no significant outliers). Moreover, we checked two tests to assess the suitability of our data for structure detection (e.g., PCA), as follows: (i) Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO) and (ii) Bartlett’s test of sphericity (BTS). KMO high values (close to 1.0) and small values (less than 0.05) of the significance level in BTS generally indicate that factor analysis may be useful for the data, whereas a KMO value less than 0.50 and values greater than 0.05 of the significance level of BTS indicate the opposite.Next, the hierarchical clustering was performed on the PCA results, using Ward’s criterion. Later, an initial partitioning was made by cutting the hierarchical tree and selecting the number of clusters following the criterion of maximum statistical distance. Finally, K-means clustering was completed to improve the initial partition obtained from hierarchical clustering. This HCPC approach allowed us to quantitatively identify the variables that most describe each cluster (by means of the v test: a value of the v test greater than 1.96 corresponds to a p-value less than 0.05; the sign of the v test indicates if the mean of the cluster is lower or greater than the overall mean), as well as the principal dimensions that are most associated with the clusters [70]. Later, after identifying the most important variables, the statistical separability among tree clusters was estimated by the non-parametric post hoc test of Kruskal–Wallis.Finally, to check the accuracy of the clustering, we split the entire database into training (70%, n = 3300) and validation (30%, n = 1411) data sets, and we ran random forest (RF) (using randomForest R package) in the classification mode [69] to predict the categorical tree classes, using the most important variables identified in HCPC analysis. To assess the precision of the RF classification, the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient (i.e., level of agreement and the percentage of data that are reliable), sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of positive results out of the number of samples which were actually positive (True Positives, TP)), specificity (i.e., proportion of negative results out of the number of samples which were actually negative (True Negatives, TN)) and accuracy (i.e., how often the classifier is correct, as judged by the equation (TP + TN)/Total) values were calculated [13].", 2. Methods, 2.4. Statistical Analysis,2
922,"Before running the HCPC analysis, we checked that all the PCA assumptions were accomplished (see Figure S3). The KMO gave a value of 0.87, which was much above the limit (0.5), and the significance level of BTS was <0.001. Accordingly, we were prevented from continuing with the analysis. Based on the HCPC analysis, we identified three clusters of trees from five significant PCs (eigenvalues > 1) that explained 85% of the total variance (Figure 5). HCPC classification selected only 14 variables as the most important ones according to the v test (Table S1). The PCA was redrawn using this shortlist of variables (Figure 5). The performance of RF classification for explaining the separability of the three clusters using the final 14 variables was rather high, as follows: the accuracy was 0.97 ± 0.02; the Cohen’s Kappa coefficient was 0.96; the sensitivity (i.e., True Positives) was 0.97 ± 0.02, and the specificity (i.e., True Negatives) was 0.99 ± 0.01 for the validation data set.According to the most important structural metrics (LiDAR-derived) for separating individual trees into distinct groups, we ascertained that Cluster 1 (C1, n = 1852) was significantly different from the other two groups, due to its high density of returns <1 m (63%) and the lowest crown LAI (CrLAI), crown volume (CrVol) and crown area (CrArea) (Figure 6 and Table S2). C1 had a high mean treetop height, of ca. 12 m, but a very low average height (ca. 3 m) due to the dominance of vegetation < 1 m. Moreover, C1 showed the highest positively skewed distribution of LiDAR returns (i.e., presence of tall, residual canopies in trees dominated by short vegetation), and the highest average and standard deviation of intensity LiDAR, mainly due to of the contrast between canopies and bare soils. This heterogeneous vegetation distribution gave place to the lowest evenness (Table S2). Cluster 2 (C2, n = 1422) had a low proportion of returns <1 m (26%), with the highest proportion of returns between 10 and 15 m (42%), the highest CrLAI, CrVol and CrArea, and the lowest understory LAI (<2.5 m) of all three clusters (Figure 6 and Table S2). C2 was composed of the tallest trees (mean treetop height 13.5 m) with a mean tree height of ca. 8 m. In addition, C2 showed the lowest negative skewed distribution of LiDAR returns, mainly due to the dominance of tall vegetation, and a lower average and standard deviation of intensity than C1 (Table S2). Finally, C3 (n = 1436) was formed by tall shrublands and small tree formations, with the lowest proportion of returns <1 m (19%) and the highest percentage of returns between 2 and 6 m (66%), showing medium CrLAI, CrVol and CrArea and the highest understory LAI of all three clusters (Figure 6 and Table S2). C3 had the lowest treetop height (c.a. 7 m) with a mean tree height of ca. 3 m. Moreover, C3 showed negative height skewness (i.e., even height distribution), the lowest average and standard deviation of intensity, and the highest evenness (Table S2).The behavior of height skewness in relation to tree crown metrics such as CrLAI was outstanding. Height skewness increased sharply in those trees with lower CrLAI, because of the combination of short vegetation and tall, sparse vegetation (i.e., residual crowns). On the contrary, the skewness lowered in healthier trees where the proportion of vegetation layers was more normally or evenly distributed in the vertical tree profiles (Figure 7a). It is likely that the density of returns <1 m was a good indicator of crown status, as it showed a robust negative relationship with CrLAI (Figure 7b).", 3. Results, 3.1. Which Structural Metrics (LiDAR-Derived) Are Most Important for Separating Individual Trees into Distinct Groups?,3
923,"The tree structures of unburned areas and those that burned under different RBR fire severity levels were rather different (Figure 8a–d). The unburned areas were mainly occupied by C3 (tall shrublands and small trees) (66%) followed by C2 (tallest trees with large and dense crowns) (32%). Low severity areas were occupied by C2 (50%) (the tallest and greatest trees) and C1 (trees with tall and residual crowns dominated by vegetation <1 m) (31%). Moderate and high severity areas were mainly occupied by C1 (81.5% and 91%, respectively) (Figure 8e). C1 was the tree class with the highest RBR, whereas C3 showed the reverse behavior, C2 being in an intermediate position (Figure 8f). Accordingly, there was a good fit between the RBR fire severity levels and Lidar tree cluster groups. However, as could be expected, there was greater variability in tree morphologies in unburned and low severity areas than in moderate to high ones.", 3. Results, 3.2. How Tree Groups Are Distributed within Fire Severity Categories,3
924,"When assessing the difference among the tree groups within each RBR Sentinel 2A fire severity level, we found that all tree clusters showed similar RBR values among them on the unburned and each of the RBR fire severity levels. On the contrary, all clusters showed significant differences among them regarding tree structures in each RBR level (Figure S4), although the differences tended to be less acute as fire severity increased (Table S3 and Figure 9).Moreover, when assessing the difference within each tree group across the RBR fire severity levels, we found that several metrics were able to significantly differentiate unburned from burned trees, as well as the different RBR severity levels within each tree group (Table S4 and Figure 10). For all clusters, CrArea, CrLAI, CrVol, understory LAI, as well as the proportion of understory/midstory vegetation (density of returns until 8 m), decreased as fire severity increased, whereas height skewness and density of returns <1 m increased. The loss of understory LAI was the tree property most significantly different between unburned and low severity trees in all clusters. Differences in CrArea, CrLAI and understory/midstory vegetation proportions were more significant for separating unburned trees from those trees less damaged by fire (C2 and C3) (Table S4 and Figure 10).On the other hand, the main tree properties able to separate the different RBR fire severity levels were different for each of the tree clusters. For C1 they were CrLAI, average tree height, height skewness and midstory vegetation (2 m–8 m). For C2 they were CrArea and midstory vegetation (2 m–6 m), and for C3 they were CrArea, CrLAI, intensity (average and standard deviation) and evenness (Table S4).Similar to those metrics, the LAD profiles were by themselves good proxies of fire severity (Figure 11). In this sense, we observed that as fire severity increased, the LAD values at low heights considerably decreased, due to the consumption and removal of understory and midstory vegetation by fire, allowing us to differentiate unburned from burned trees, as well as crown fires from surface fires.", 3. Results, 3.3. How Tree Groups Related to RBR Sentinel 2A Fire Severity Levels,3
925,"Here we show that a classification at the tree level using HCPC and random forests resulted in highly accurate clustering. Our approach distinguished three clusters characterized by different tree structures: the first was mainly composed of trees affected by crown fire; the second was formed by trees that were mainly burned by surface fire, and the third contained trees with tall shrubs and small tree formations that were mainly unburned. The most important variables differentiating the three clusters provided clues about how the ecologically meaningful LiDAR metrics were able to separate the trees by the level of damage (e.g., CrArea, CrVol and CrLAI) [10,32]. Other LiDAR metrics were good indirect indicators of tree damage (e.g., height skewness and density of returns <1 m), due to their negative relationship with crown LAI [18], whereas others were complementary to one another (e.g., average tree height, treetop height and density of vegetation layers), and using them alone could lead to erroneous results. For example, high-severity trees with tall treetops but low average tree heights, mainly due to the very low density of returns at high heights (>10 m) and the high density of returns at low heights (<1 m), would indicate important crown damage.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Which Structural Metrics (LiDAR-Derived) Are Most Important for Separating Individual Trees into Distinct Groups?,4
926,"The three clusters based on tree characteristics were differentiated rather well in terms of their Sentinel 2A RBR metrics. However, the RBR severity levels were not homogeneous in terms of tree structure clustering, and each of these RBR levels had a mixture of tree structures [13]. While broad RBR thresholds were applied to detect different severity levels, a range of crown severities and morphologies was included in those thresholds, contributing to the variability in structural responses observed. We found that open structures with high damaged trees (cluster C1) were strongly dominant within the high fire severely RBR areas, whereas unburned and less severely burned ones showed more complexity in tree morphologies, suggesting that low and moderate severity fires increase heterogeneity [11]. Here, the large variation in tree structures in unburned and low to moderately severely burned areas highlighted the value of monitoring fire-induced damage with LiDAR, rather than optical satellite data [11,12,18,23], due to the spatial and spectral limitations that optical sensors have [20,21], for estimating the fine-grain heterogeneity in fire severity [11,22,23]. In unburned and less severely burned areas, optical satellite data have a limited ability to capture understory and midstory vegetation structures, particularly in high canopy cover forests, whereas LiDAR is more sensitive to these types of change [19].", 4. Discussion, 4.2. How Tree Groups Are Distributed within Fire Severity Categories,4
927,"All clusters showed significant differences among them regarding tree properties in each RBR level, although as fire severity increased those differences tended to be diluted. On the other hand, within each cluster, increasing fire severity resulted in a significant loss in crown LAI, crown area and crown volume, as well as a large reduction in understory/midstory vegetation, in agreement with Karna et al. [32]. Furthermore, the reduction in understory LAI allowed for separating significantly unburned trees from low severity burned ones in the three tree clusters. However, the tree properties able to significantly separate the different RBR severity levels varied among tree groups, highlighting changes in midstory vegetation for clusters 1 and 2, and changes in crown area for clusters 2 and 3.Furthermore, height evenness and skewness significantly decreased (higher uneven height distribution) as fire severity increased due to the presence of both residual tall stems and bare soils, as shown by Bolton et al. [18] and Bishop et al. [31], but contrary to the results of Karna et al. [32] who found that crown evenness significantly increased at moderate to high fire severity. In addition, we did not find significant differences in treetop height or mean tree height as fire severity increased [32]. On the other hand, it has been shown that higher LiDAR intensities have been associated with green foliage, while lower LiDAR intensities with non-photosynthetic woody material, including dead vegetation [10,13]. Here, we ascertained that intensity metrics played a secondary role in differentiating tree groups and in the assessment of differences in severity levels. However, we found that LiDAR intensity significantly decreased as fire severity increased in the case of small trees/tall shrubs (C3), although it was almost insensitive in the case of tall trees, as in clusters 1 and 2, maybe because they kept a great part of the top canopy undamaged.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. How Tree Groups Related to RBR Sentinel 2A Fire Severity Levels,4
928,"The main limitations of this study are related to the lack of a larger field sampling of individual trees, and the lack of other measures such as stem and twig size or biomass indicative of the combustion degree. In future work, we propose to use multispectral and thermal unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and LiDAR data, as well as high-density multi-temporal LiDAR data (pre- and post-fire), to quantifying fire-induced forest changes (e.g., [22,28,31]). This will permit the calculation of the degree of consumption of the plants or soil litter during a fire with very high precision. Whenever possible, during the progression of current forest fires, the UAV LiDAR (LidarPod) should be flown in coordination and under permit of the relevant authorities, during late evening or early morning, when the firefighting helicopters or planes have halted their operations, in order to avoid the risk of collision. This would facilitate the maintaining of unburned patches that will later burn as true controls for fire severity and biomass consumption calculations. Crown volume and biomass losses and post-fire tree morphologies, as reconstructed from LiDAR, will be used to provide comparable metrics of fire severity. Additionally, when the UAV LiDAR cannot be used during fire progression, other LiDAR data available, such as the National Flights available for mainland Spain (LIDAR-PNOA), could be used to characterize pre-fire vegetation structure. Nevertheless, our high-density LiDAR data provided by the device LidarPod are not directly comparable with LIDAR-PNOA, with a very low density of point clouds (0.5–1 point/m2), thus operational challenges remain in obtaining both pre- and post-fire LiDAR metrics with comparable data quality [14]. As the pre- and post-fire LiDAR data had different point densities, the canopy metrics could be affected in complex ways, interacting with differences in slope and elevation due to large differences in the Digital Terrain Models (DTM) derived [31].By combining measures of LiDAR-derived post-fire tree structure with satellite-derived fire severity levels, variabilities in early fire effects could be characterized with high precision over large forested areas. Our results demonstrate the value of fusing RBR fire severity levels with LiDAR data for contextualizing different tree structures in terms of fire severity, and giving a physical–ecological meaning to reflectance-based spectral indices. These results can assist forest managers in better identifying the areas most severely burned for conservation and restoration plans after wildfires, and for wildlife habitat assessments and other post-fire applications, such as fire’s effects on soils.", 4. Discussion, 4.4. Limitations and Future Work,4
929,"Damage to canopy structures can provide a sensitive indicator of the degree of fuel consumption by fire, and thus of fire severity. Here, we made a comprehensive use of the vertical canopy profiles from high-density LiDAR data to obtain several metrics related to biophysical single-tree characteristics, such as crown properties, LAI values, vegetation layer distribution and diversity. Moreover, using inflection points to derive the canopy base height, crown volume could be estimated. All these metrics at the tree-level allowed the distinguishing of three clusters of tree morphologies, which were separated rather well among each other. These tree structure-derived clusters were unevenly distributed in the different RBR Sentinel 2 fire severity levels. Unburned and low severity burned areas were more diverse than moderate and high severity burned ones. Furthermore, LiDAR metrics were able to distinguish crown fire from surface fire through changes in the understory LAI, and the understory and midstory vegetation. Moreover, the LiDAR metrics indicated that vegetation layers’ distribution within a tree, and crown properties, were important for estimating the impact of fire on single trees, a feature that was not captured by the RBR Sentinel 2 index. Although RBR was not able to distinguish tree morphologies, especially in unburned and low severity areas, due to their inability to penetrate the forest canopy, we could ascertain that the RBR Sentinel 2 index is an adequate proxy of fire severity. The three tree structure clusters were rather well differentiated spatially and spectrally by the RBR fire severity levels, and significant intra-cluster differences in terms of LiDAR metrics were observed among RBR fire severity levels. When high-resolution LiDAR data, as we used here, is available, it provides a high spatial resolution, at the level of a single tree, which is needed for ecological impact studies. Tree-based fire severity maps at this level of detail could thus be used to develop more precise, site-specific fire impact studies and post-fire management plans.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
930,"Soil water content is one of the key state variables in the soil–vegetation–atmosphere continuum, which is due to its role in the exchange of water and energy at the soil surface [1,2]. Soil water content is of great importance for several applications throughout numerous disciplines,; however, its quantification at a range of scales is challenging due to its spatial and temporal heterogeneity [3]. Accurate knowledge of the soil water content at a range of spatial scales is critical for water management, improved weather prediction, flood forecasting, and efficient irrigation scheduling [4,5].In recent years, the Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) has been developed and deployed across the globe to provide area-averaged soil water content estimates at an intermediate scale, which circumvents the shortcomings of currently existing soil water content measurement methods (at this scale) [6,7]. The CRNS is a novel non-invasive technique, which utilizes the low-energy cosmic ray neutron intensity above the ground surface, which is primarily moderated by the hydrogen content within the CRNS’s measurement footprint. [8]. Since CRNS avoids the use of an active neutron source, the method can be implemented in various sites and appears to provide reliable estimates of the soil water content once calibrated [9,10].Recent improvements in soil water content estimation techniques are demonstrating optimal performances at intermediate scales. Studies conducted by Bauer-Marschallinger et al. [11] and El Hajj et al. [12] utilized Sentinel satellite data to provide soil water content estimates at high spatial resolutions (1 km), whilst Strati et al. [13] monitored soil water content at a fine spatial resolution (~25 m radius) using gamma ray spectroscopy.The CRNS functions at its most fundamental level as a hydrogen mass detector, where the observed change in neutron intensity is dependent on all changes of hydrogen present in its support volume [7]. The abundance of hydrogen atoms in the air and soil largely controls the removal rate of low-energy neutrons from the support volume [14]. These hydrogen atoms are present as soil water, lattice water, water in soil organic carbon, below and above-ground biomass, atmospheric water vapour, snow, water intercepted by vegetation, and water on the ground (ponding) [15,16,17]. These different hydrogen sources have different temporal variability and can be static (lattice water), quasi-static (soil organic matter, biomass), and dynamic (soil water, atmospheric water vapour) [18,19]. Hydrogen is an essential element in the moderation of these cosmic ray neutrons due to hydrogen’s physical properties and high concentration near the land surface [6]. Soil water is generally the major source of hydrogen at the land surface (60–80% of the mass in the CRNS support volume [19]) and is therefore suitable to be estimated from the changes in neutron intensity. In order to isolate the soil water signal from the neutron intensity, the other sources of hydrogen need to be accounted for. The high amount of hydrogen present in pools other than soil water reduces the accuracy of CRNS’s soil water content estimates [1]. The implementation of the CRNS has been rapidly growing on a global scale, as the method provides root-zone soil water content at an unprecedented spatial scale [20].The applications of the CRNS are not limited to the estimation of soil water content, as the instrument is currently used to estimate other pools of hydrogen, which include snow depth and biomass [21]. Biomass is a significant source of hydrogen in certain land uses (forestry and agriculture). Currently, there are only a handful of methods used to quantify biomass. These include direct sampling, forest allometry, and remote sensing. The use of the CRNS to estimate biomass is an ongoing question, which has continuously gained attention. Since the inception of the CRNS, there have been several studies that have focused on the estimation of biomass using the CRNS. These initial studies investigated the correction of site biomass, to account for the attenuation of the cosmic ray neutron intensity by biomass, and to improve the accuracy of the CRNS’s soil water content estimates.There have been several CRNS studies involving biomass (Table 1).Biomass estimation is of great importance for a variety of applications, which include bioenergy, carbon sequestration, and wood production [6]. Accurate measurements of area-average biomass are difficult to obtain at scales consistent with measurements of mass and energy transfer (1 km) [23]. The potential use of the CRNS to estimate biomass is highly attractive, as it would allow for the effects of biomass to be removed when estimating soil water content, without the need for additional measurements, and simultaneous measurements of biomass and soil water content would be valuable in improving the understanding between plant growth and soil water content deficits [2].This research study focused on the CRNS and its use to estimate soil water content in an Acacia mearnsii (black wattle) forest stand that was undergoing clear-felling. The clear-felling was within the Two-Streams Research Catchment, which has been equipped with a CRNS (since 2014). This presented a unique opportunity to monitor the soil water content before, during, and after the clear-felling to investigate the impacts that clear-felling has on soil water content. The long-term deployment of the CRNS in the catchment also presented the opportunity of using the CRNS to estimate biomass within a forested site. A second CRNS was also set up in the catchment on a mast, at a height of 18 m above the land surface, a few months before the clear-felling. The installation of a second CRNS at a different height was designed to study the changes in the neutron intensities due to the clear-felling and allowed for the evaluation of altitude on neutron dynamics. It is important to note that the clear-felling occurred during a drought period, such that the hypothesized effects due to clear-felling are challenging to fully assess.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
931,"The Two-Streams Research Catchment, which is located 70 km (north-east) from the city of Pietermaritzburg, is one of South Africa’s most intensively studied long-term forestry research catchments, with almost two decades of detailed hydrological process observations [27]. The Two-Streams Catchment (Figure 1) situated in the Seven Oaks district, in KwaZulu-Natal [28]. The altitude of the site ranges from 1080 to 1125 m. The site is in the summer rainfall region and the mean annual rainfall of the area ranges from 659 to 1139 mm. The region is susceptible to moderate frosts, heavy mists, droughts, and hail [27]. The heavy mists are significant in providing additional precipitation in the area, which gets intercepted onto the above-ground forest biomass. From past water-use studies conducted at the Two-Streams site, the trees used more water (transpiration) than they received through precipitation. Therefore, the trees were utilizing groundwater.The natural vegetation of the area was previously forb-rich tall Themeda triandra grasslands; however, due to the high arable potential of the area, only a few patches remain [28]. Forestry is the most widespread land use in the area, as it is ecologically suitable, whilst sugarcane is less widespread and is grown on sites where the drainage of cold air is good [28]. The CRNS was set up in the black wattle forest stand and had a 210-m measurement radius, which was calculated using equations from Köhli et al. [29], resulting in a measurement footprint area of 0.1385 km2.The Two-Streams Research Catchment had a CRNS at the height of 2 m, which has been operational since 2014. A second CRNS was installed on the same tower, at the height of 18 m, on the 16th October 2017. The tower CRNS had a 211-m measurement radius, which was calculated using equations from Köhli et al. [29]. Therefore, the tower CRNS had a larger measurement footprint (0.1398 km2) than the ground CRNS (0.1385 km2). The aim of installing a CRNS on the tower was to obtain cosmic ray neutron data, to firstly support any changes in neutron intensity due to the clear-felling and to investigate the effects of elevation on cosmic ray neutron dynamics (Figure 2).", 2.

932,"Black wattle is one of the few tree crops of which both the bark and timber are utilized. Black wattle, which is a leguminous tree native to Australia, was first introduced into South Africa in the mid-1800s [30]. In the following years, it was planted extensively to satisfy demands from a burgeoning forestry industry, and for the production of tannin from the bark, as well as for pulp used in the production of high-quality paper. Black wattle, which is a tall-growing (15.5–21.5 m [31]) and thorn-less evergreen tree, is the most widespread alien invasive tree in South Africa [32]. Black wattle remains a valuable tree under commercial plantations and it possesses positive characteristics. For example, it is an efficient nitrogen fixer and is also used to stabilize slopes (reduce erosion), as it can grow on steep slopes [30]. Black wattle is evergreen and therefore utilizes a large amount of the water throughout the year when compared with the natural seasonal grassland it has replaced [32].", 2.

933,"The use of Google satellite imagery nicely illustrates the biomass changes within the Two-Streams Research Catchment from 2005 to 2018 (Figure 3a–f): (a) The site on the 6th March 2005, one year before the black wattle was planted; (b) the site on the 10th February 2010, the black wattle stand was ~four years old; (c) the site on the 26th August 2013, the black wattle stand was ~seven years old; (d) the site on the 29th July 2015, the black wattle stand was ~nine years old; (e) the site on the 5th July 2017, the black wattle stand was ~11 years old; and (f) the site on the 8th June 2018 a few months after the clear-felling. The images were taken at different growth stages and at different seasons. The black wattle stands were green and “full”, even in the dry season (winter months).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Two-Streams Research Catchment Biomass Changes,2
934,"Clear-felling is the removal of all the trees from an area, in which the trunks are removed from the site and the logging residue (branches and foliage) is left on the ground to dry and is subsequently burnt at a later stage. Clear-felling is a method of regenerating an evenly aged stand, in which the new stand develops in a fully exposed microclimate. The clear-felling at the Two-Streams Research Catchment was conducted in stages and not all at once, which resulted in the clear-felling spanning over several weeks. Initially, every second tree row was removed; therefore, the hydrogen source attributed to the above-ground biomass decreased in stages and not all at once.Clear-felling results in full sunlight conditions on the soil surface, which leads to an increase in air and soil temperatures near the surface. The relative humidity decreases and there is an increase in soil surface evaporation. The soil water content increases as the transpiration ceases when the trees are removed. The interception of precipitation decreases, which leads to more water reaching the soil surface; this leads to an increase in infiltration, percolation, and subsequent subsurface flow. Due to the warmer and wetter conditions at the surface, there is an increase in decomposition, which leads to more nutrients being released. These changes are favourable for the establishment and development of the next crop.The method of clear-felling also has disadvantages, which includes a loss of habitat, the threat of invasive species, the release of stored carbon and a potential increase in erosion and soil damage. At the Two-Streams site, the forest canopy intercepted mist, which was a significant source of precipitation within this site. The loss of the canopy would result in the mist not being intercepted and an overall decrease in the precipitation (from mist) at the site.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Clear-Felling Procedure and Potential Impacts,2
935,"The ground and tower CRNS consists of two neutron detectors, whose measurements can be differentiated into two neutron energy ranges, which are both sensitive to hydrogen [29]. The moderated neutron detector measures epithermal neutrons (above 0.5 eV) and the bare neutron detector measures thermal neutrons (0–0.5 eV) [33]. It is also important to note that fast neutrons have energies, which range from 10–1000 eV; therefore, fast neutrons are included in the epithermal neutron range [34]. The moderated detector is shielded by a 2.54-cm-thick polyethylene that serves two purposes, which are to moderate (slow down) the epithermal neutrons so that they can be counted and to block out the thermal neutrons [6]. Epithermal neutrons are continuously losing energy by collisions with atomic nuclei (and other neutrons) and will eventually be transformed into thermal neutrons [2]. The cosmic ray radiation, which is naturally occurring, can be separated into primary cosmic ray neutrons that originate in space and secondary cosmic ray neutrons, which are created by interactions with matter in the atmosphere [1]. The cosmic ray neutron intensity (count rate) and sensing volume are dependent on the total amount of hydrogen within the CRNS’s measurement footprint. As such, the extraordinary high stopping power of hydrogen makes the technique work [8,33,35].Although the moderated detector primarily measures epithermal neutrons and the bare detector primarily measures thermal neutrons, the exact energy sensitivity of the detectors are unknown [34]. In order to obtain pure thermal and epithermal neutron intensities from the moderated and bare detectors, the epithermal contribution has to be removed from the bare detector and the thermal contribution has to be removed from the moderated detector [34]. The contribution of epithermal and thermal neutrons measured by the moderated and bare detectors can be determined using the cadmium-difference method.The epithermal and thermal neutron intensities were obtained from the moderated and bare detectors, following the procedure outlined in Andreasen et al.

where B is the bare neutron intensity (counts per hour) (cph)), M is the moderated neutron intensity(cph), α1 (0.0290) is the fraction of the epithermal neutron intensity measured by the moderated detector, α2 (0.445) is the fraction of the thermal neutron intensity measured by the bare detector, and β1 (12.2 cph) and β2 (−1.53 cph) are offsets. The parameters α1, α2, β1, and β2, were obtained from Andreasen et al. [34].The thermal and epithermal intensities (cph) were obtained by rearranging Equations (1) and (2):

The horizontal footprint of the CRNS is defined as the area around the probe in which 86% of the neutrons arise [8]. Due to the low interaction probability of neutrons with air molecules, the measured particles can travel hundreds of meters from the soil to the detector [36]. The radius of the measurement footprint was initially believed to be 300 m at sea level; however, a recent study by Köhli et al. [29] revised the measurement footprint radius to 240 m at sea level.The effective measurement depth is the thickness at which 86% of the counted neutrons arise, which depends strongly on the soil water content [8]. The measurement depth ranges from 0.12 to 0.7 m and is inversely proportional to the soil water content [33]. The decrease in the measurement depth as a result of an increase in the soil water content is nonlinear [37]. The effective measurement depth of the CRNS at the Two-Streams site ranges from 0.139 and 0.297 m, which was calculated using the procedure outlined in [36].The CRNS measures the neutron intensity, which is dependent on all sources and variations in hydrogen within the instrument’s measurement footprint. The soil water content can be determined by isolating the soil water signal within the neutron intensity, which is achieved by accounting for all the sources and variations of hydrogen [17]. This is carried out by the correction and calibration procedures.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.5. The Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor,2
936,"To isolate the effect of soil water on the measured neutron count, it is first necessary to account for the variations in the atmospheric water vapour [38], which has the same moderating effect as the soil water content, and variations in external factors, which include atmospheric pressure and the incoming neutron flux intensity [9,33]. The procedure in carrying out these corrections are well documented in several past research studies [9,37]. Once these corrections have been carried out, the corrected neutron counts are dependent on the soil water, lattice water, soil organic carbon, and biomass, which will be addressed in the calibration.The standard N0 (calibration) method presented by Desilets et al. [39] was undertaken. The calibration required simultaneous measurements of area-averaged soil water content and neutron count [35,40]. The site-specific calibrations implicitly included vegetation effects on the observed neutron counts [23,37]. Therefore, for sites with non-varying variations in biomass (grassland), the biomass correction is not required, as the change in hydrogen of the biomass within the site is insignificant and can be ignored in the calibration. The lattice water and the water in soil organic carbon can significantly affect the neutron count and was therefore a necessary source of hydrogen to measure and forms part of the standard calibration procedure [37]. The calibration equation proposed by Desilets et al. [39] is as follows:

where N is the corrected neutron counts, and θt is the total water (g g−1), which consists of the gravimetric soil water content (θp), lattice water (θlw), and soil organic carbon (θsoc) all in units of g g−1. To convert from the gravimetric soil water content to the volumetric soil water content, both sides must be multiplied by the bulk density [21]. A biomass correction factor has been incorporated into a revised calibration equation. However, for the purpose of this research, the standard calibration equation was used. Therefore, the biomass was explicitly accounted for in each N0 (calibration) value.Four calibrations were conducted at the Two-Streams site. Three calibrations were conducted prior to the clear-felling and one calibration was conducted after clear-felling. The calibrations conducted before the clear-felling were on the 4th April 2016, 30th September 2016, and the 21st April 2017. The calibration after the clear-felling was conducted on the 6th August 2018. The lattice water (13.4 g g−1), bulk density (1.2 g cm−2), and the soil organic carbon (0.03 g g−1) values of the site were determined. The clear-felling at the Two-Streams site commenced on the 10th January 2018 and was conducted over 2–3 weeks. The felled trunks were removed immediately to a staging point away from the CRNS footprint. A mean moisture content of 41% was obtained from previous research conducted on the site (this value would not have varied over time). The residues were burnt, cleared, and mulched. Therefore, it is assumed that these residues would not have been detectable. Ideally, one calibration should have been conducted a day before the clear-felling and one calibration should have been conducted once the clear-felling had been completed. However, this did not happen as the clear-felling went ahead of schedule and the site was off limits due to safety rules for the period in which the clear-felling occurred. The planned calibration a few days after the clear-felling was not possible, as the residual biomass was burning, and a calibration could not be conducted. Therefore, a post clear-felling calibration was conducted several months later.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.6. Corrections and Calibration,2
937,"In situ sampling is the traditional/conventional approach used to quantify biomass. This method involves the physical harvesting of plants/trees. These harvested plants/trees are first weighed for their mass, before being dried and subsequently weighed once more, to determine the change in weight. The change in weight is the amount of water that the plant/tree contained and is used to determine the dry biomass. The advantage of this method is that it is accurate on an individual sample scale. The disadvantages of this method are that it is a destructive approach (repeat sampling cannot be done on the same tree), it is time and labour consuming, and the spatial heterogeneity is difficult to extrapolate [41]. In situ sampling was not conducted for this research study; however, past research conducted in the region was used. A study by Dovey et al. [31] determined a dry above-ground biomass of 148 t ha−1 (14.8 kg m−2) of Acacia mearnsii by destructive sampling in the Mistley region (same region as the Two-Streams site). The tree age, management practices, tree heights, and diameter at breast height (DBH) were very similar to that of the black wattle plantation at the Two-Streams site and therefore the above-ground biomass was assumed to be similar.", 3. Methods of Biomass Estimation, 3.1. In Situ Sampling,3
938,"Forest allometry (biomass estimation equations) is used to estimate the above-ground biomass based on tree parameters, such as the DBH and tree height. The use of forest allometry is a common and cost-effective method to estimate above-ground biomass [41]. The average DBH at the Two-Streams site was determined to be 150 mm and the average tree height was determined to be 18.5 m. There are several forest allometry equations; however, this research did not intend to compare allometric equations and since there are past relatable above-ground biomass measurements, the use of forest allometry was not be explored.", 3. Methods of Biomass Estimation, 3.2. Forest Allometry,3
939,"The remote sensing of biomass is dependent on the principles of plant light reflectance [41]. The advantage of this method is that large spatial scales are obtained and there is a regular (satellite dependent) temporal resolution. Common remote sensing metrics used to quantify vegetation are the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the leaf area index (LAI). The NDVI/LAI value increases with increased green biomass.For the purpose of this research, Landsat 8 imagery was obtained from EarthExplorer. The Landsat 8 products have a 16-day temporal resolution and a 30-m spatial resolution. The data were processed in the Integrated Land and Water Information System (ILWIS) to obtain the NDVI and the LAI. The 30-m resolution of the Landsat 8 product resulted in several pixels within the CRNS footprint. Therefore, the average NDVI and LAI values were obtained for each observation date. The Landsat 8 imagery is on a 16-day temporal resolution, which is further limited using only cloud-free observation days.

The accurate estimation of soil water content is possible as it is (generally) the largest contributor of hydrogen to the CRNS signal.

where Nr is the neutron ratio, E is the epithermal neutron count, T is the thermal neutron count, mean E is the time-averaged epithermal neutron count (over the data period), and mean T is the time-averaged thermal neutron count (over the data period). The epithermal neutrons are subject to variations in the incoming cosmic ray neutron intensity, atmospheric water vapour, and air pressure. The thermal neutrons corrections have not been finalized by the scientific community; therefore, for the purpose of this research, the neutron ratio was determined using the corrected epithermal neutron counts and raw thermal neutron counts.", 3.

941,"As previously mentioned, a total of three calibrations were conducted before clear-felling and one calibration was conducted after clear-felling. The dates, neutron counts, volumetric water content (VWC) (%), and N0 values are illustrated in Table 2. There is a noticeable increase in the neutron count due to the clear-felling. This was expected, as the clear-felling resulted in the removal of the above-ground biomass, which led to a reduction in the hydrogen present, with a concomitant decrease in the moderation of epithermal neutrons. The average N0 value for the forested calibrations was 2907.39. The clear-felling resulted in an increase in the N0 value (3369.20). The difference in the N0 value between the average “forested” calibrations (2907.39) and the “clear-felled” calibration (3369.20) was 461.81. Therefore, the presence of the above-ground forest biomass reduced the N0 value by 13.7%. The dry above-ground biomass was estimated to be 13.7 kg m−2, using the relationship identified by Franz et al. [25], which found a 1% decline in N0 for every 1 kg m−2 of biomass present for maize and soybean crops.Daily average soil water content estimates (Figure 4) were created from the hourly time steps, as longer integration periods resulted in less uncertainty, due to the Poisson counting statistics associated with the method (standard deviation = N0.5). The daily time series illustrates two scenarios. The first (blue) is the CRNS soil water content estimates before, during, and after the clear-felling (calibrated with the average “forested” calibration value of 2907.39). Seasonality in the soil water content was seen, as the soil water content was higher (above ~15% VWC) in summer (wet period) and lower in winter (below ~15% VWC). The variability in soil water content was greater in the summer months, which can be attributed to increased rainfall events and the increase in total evaporation. The point at which the clear-felling was undertaken is clearly seen, as it was accompanied by a noticeable decrease (~10% VWC) in soil water content estimates (due to an increase in neutron intensity).The second scenario (red) illustrates the soil water content estimates after the clear-felling, using the clear-felled calibration value (3369.20). The use of the clear-felled calibration value resulted in higher soil water content estimates (~15% VWC) when compared to the first scenario. Although this example is an extreme case in which the biomass has been removed, the need to account for changes in biomass was highlighted, particularly in cases with sudden temporal changes in biomass, such as in agriculture and forestry.The calibration curves were produced using the neutron counts and VWC (%) before the clear-felling (forested) and after the removal of the biomass (clear-felled) (Figure 5). The difference between the forested and clear-felled curves is the difference in the amount of hydrogen within the measurement footprint, which resulted in the calibration curves having different N0 values.", 4.

942,"The second component of the results section investigated the use of the CRNS’s epithermal and thermal neutrons to monitor biomass. The CRNS near the ground surface (ground) and top of the tower (tower) data were analyzed. A time series of the average daily epithermal and thermal neutron counts from the tower and ground CRNS’s (Figure 6) illustrate the effect that elevation has on the neutrons. A higher probability of adsorption reactions exists for thermal neutrons and a higher probability of scattering reactions exists for epithermal neutrons. The epithermal neutron intensity measured by the tower CRNS was higher (~120 cph) than that of the epithermal neutron intensity measured by the ground CRNS, which is due to the epithermal neutrons at the tower CRNS being scattered less than at the ground surface. The thermal neutron intensity measured by the tower CRNS was significantly lower (~240 cph) than the thermal neutron intensity measured by the ground CRNS, as the production rate of thermal neutrons is higher in the soil and lower in the air. The occurrence of the clear-felling was seen on the neutron counts, such that the epithermal neutron counts increased due to the clear-felling, whilst the thermal neutrons decreased as a result of the clear-felling. The increase in epithermal neutrons occurred due to a decrease in moderation. From the epithermal neutron counts before and after the clear-felling, there was a 12.43% reduction in epithermal neutrons due to the above-ground biomass forest biomass, which equated to a dry above-ground biomass of 13.81 kg m−2, using the relationship observed in Baat et al. [24].The vegetation water content is assumed to be the weight loss after the biomass is dried. The total biomass water equivalent consists of vegetation water as well as hydrogen and oxygen present in other molecules within the dry above-ground biomass. This study assumed that this water equivalent in dry above-ground biomass can be approximated by the amount of hydrogen and oxygen contained in cellulose (C6H10O5), which is ∼55.6% by weight. Therefore, the relationships outlined in Baatz et al. [24] and Franz et al. [25] will hold for all plant material (including Acacia mearnsii).Scatterplots of the neutron intensities of the ground CRNS (x-axis) and tower CRNS (y-axis) are plotted for both the epithermal and thermal neutron intensities (Figure 7). Both scatterplots illustrate very high correlations between the ground and tower CRNSs. There was a higher correlation between the thermal neutron intensity (R2 of 0.987) compared to the epithermal neutron intensity (R2 of 0.954). The high correlation indicated that although there were differences in the neutron intensities between the ground and tower CRNS (particularly in the thermal energy range), the relative changes in neutron intensity were maintained despite the difference in elevation.The daily neutron ratio (thermal/epithermal) was determined for both the ground and tower CRNS (Figure 8). The neutron ratios of the ground and tower CRNS followed the same trend, as there was a noticeable decrease in the neutron ratio due to the clear-felling. Prior to the clear-felling, the neutron ratios were ~1.6 and after the clear-felling, the neutron ratios were ~0.8. The tower CRNS seems to be more variable (“noisier”), as there is a greater difference between the epithermal and thermal neutron intensity at the tower CRNS than the ground CRNS. This results in the tower CRNS having a higher (mean E/ mean T) value (7.1) compared to the ground CRNS (3.15). Therefore, using Equation (8), a greater daily variability in the neutron ratio is seen at the tower CRNS than the ground CRNS.A scatterplot of the ground CRNS neutron ratio (x-axis) was plotted against the tower CRNS neutron ratio (y-axis) (Figure 9). The neutron ratios have a high correlation (R2 of 0.986). This indicated that the ratios were consistent, with regards to the variations in neutron intensities due to changes in biomass and variations in elevation.For the purpose of the next analysis, the ground CRNS ratio was used, since both CRNSs correlated well and the ground CRNS had the longer dataset. The use of remote sensing to monitor changes in biomass was evaluated against the neutron ratio, which was a measure of the biomass present. The variables derived by the Landsat 8 data in the ILWIS model were the NDVI and LAI. A time series of the NDVI and LAI was plotted against the CRNS ratio (Figure 10). There was a decrease in both the NDVI and LAI in the dry period before the clear-felling, which is consistent with the change in seasons (wet to dry). The trend in NDVI and LAI was similar due to the LAI being determined using the NDVI. The NDVI decreased from ~0.7 before the clear-felling to ~0.36 after the clear-felling. The LAI decreased from ~2 before the clear-felling to ~0.9 after the clear-felling. Fortunately, there were NDVI and LAI values a few weeks before (28th of December 2017) and during/after (13th of January 2018) the clear-felling.Scatterplots of the neutron ratio (x-axis) and NDVI (y-axis), and neutron ratio (x-axis) and LAI (y-axis) are illustrated in Figure 11.There was a high correlation between the neutron ratio and NDVI (R2 of 0.868) and neutron ratio and LAI (R2 of 0.817); however, it should be noted that only very few observation points drive the regression line. This correlation showed the agreement in the biomass estimation between remote sensing variables and the CRNS as innovative tools to measure and monitor biomass (Figure 11).A relationship between the neutron ratio and N0 was determined, which could assist with accounting for the temporal changes in biomass. For the purpose of this exercise, the neutron ratio from the bottom CRNS was utilized, along with the corresponding N0 values (for all four calibrations) to create a relationship between the two variables (Figure 12).The trendline equation from Figure 12 (y = −566.11x + 3677.5) was then used to determine a daily N0 value using the daily neutron ratio values. The daily N0 values were then used to determine the CRNS’s soil water content estimates (Figure 13). The time series illustrates the CRNS soil water content estimates under three scenarios:Using the forested calibration value (forested);Using the clear-felled calibration value (clear-felled) andUsing the calibration value derived from the N0–neutron ratio relationship.The use of the N0–neutron ratio to provide CRNS soil water content estimates resulted in the general trend in soil water content seasonality being illustrated.Both the forested and clear-felled CRNS soil water content estimates were considered reliable. However, the N0–neutron ratio approach resulted in soil water content estimates that correlated better with the conventional CRNS approach in the dry months than in the wet months. During the dry months, the difference between the N0–neutron ratio approach and the conventional approach was small, compared to the wet months, as the difference increased with rainfall. Therefore, the difference in soil water content estimates can potentially be attributed to:The N0–neutron ratio underestimating the soil water content at the wet end.The calibrations were conducted on non-rainfall days, which resulted in the relationship not being able to reliably predict the soil water content during periods of rainfall.The N0–neutron ratio includes interception and ponding of rainfall, which does not necessarily result in an increase in the soil water content.The N0–neutron ratio approach agreed with the calibration points during the study period and substantiated the expected increase in the soil water content due to the clear-felling. Due to the clear-felling and removal of biomass from the site being done in stages, the N0–neutron ratio approach appeared to estimate the soil water content according to the biomass present on site and did not show any sudden changes in the soil water content, which were not supplemented with the occurrence of rainfall.The root mean squared error (RMSE), bias, and unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) were determined for the soil water content estimates determined by the N0–neutron ration approach against the conventional calibration approach scenarios (forested, clear-felled, and both) (Table 3). The N0–neutron ratio approach has a lower RMSE (2.320), bias (1.659), and ubRMSE (1.622) for the clear-felled conditions compared to the forested conditions (RMSE (4.128), bias (−2.003), ubRMSE (3.610)).", 4. Results and Discussion, 4.2. The Use of the Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor to Monitor Biomass,4
943,"The use of the CRNS, as an innovative tool to estimate soil water content at an intermediate scale, has gained recognition on a global scale. The clear-felling at the Two-Streams site presented the unique opportunity to use the CRNS to continuously monitor soil water content and biomass simultaneously before, during, and after the clear-felling. The CRNS is affected by all sources of hydrogen within its measurement footprint. It is therefore important to account for variations in biomass to obtain reliable soil water content estimates. Biomass increases the hydrogen concentration in the CRNS’s footprint and results in the increase in epithermal neutron moderation and adsorption. The presence of the forest biomass reduced the epithermal neutron intensity by 12.43% and reduced the N0 value by 13.8%.The dry above-ground biomass of the black wattle stand was determined to be 14.8 kg m−2 by past studies, using in situ sampling. The dry above-ground biomass estimation due to the change in epithermal neutron intensity was determined to be 13.8 kg m−2, and the dry above-ground biomass due to the change in N0 was determined to be 13.7 kg m−2. Therefore, both these methods used to estimate the dry above-ground biomass with the CRNS are consistent and provide reliable estimates. The use of the CRNS to monitor biomass showed that the CRNS could be used with confidence, as the changes in the neutron ratio were in good agreement with the changes in biomass. The neutron ratio also correlated well with the remote sensing vegetative indices and obtained R2 values of 0.868 and 0.817 with the NDVI and LAI, respectively.The neutron ratio was used to provide daily N0 values, which were subsequently used to provide daily soil water content estimates. This approach seems promising in order to account for temporal changes in biomass (crop growth). However, this approach requires further investigation, as it underestimates soil water content during the wet season. The results of this study are promising and show the capability of the CRNS to monitor both soil water content and biomass simultaneously, at a field scale. As hypothesized, the removal of the forest biomass resulted in an increase in the surface soil water content at the site.Future research should further investigate the capability of the CRNS to estimate biomass under different vegetation types and should also aim at using the CRNS to determine other hydrogen sources (rainfall and interception) within the CRNS’s measurement footprint. This will aid in increasing the accuracy of the CRNS’s soil water content estimates by removing the interception signal from the neutron intensity. Interception is a potential issue if not accounted for, especially in forested sites, as the water that is intercepted by the forest canopy and litter layer and subsequently evaporated is seen by the CRNS as an increase and subsequent decrease in the soil water content.In order to make measured and modelled neutron intensities more comparable, research should also develop the use of the cadmium-difference method to obtain pure epithermal and thermal neutron intensities from the moderated and bare detectors. This study assumed that the epithermal and thermal footprints were the same when determining the neutron ratio. The epithermal neutron footprint has been characterized in past modelling studies, however, by the extent of the thermal footprint and the factors that influence it, which needs to be addressed in future research.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
944,"Forest biomass is considered a key factor in carbon and water cycles in terrestrial ecosystems. Spatial estimates of forest biomass are therefore needed for understanding the sources and sinks of terrestrial carbon and for accomplishing scientific and practical tasks in forest management [1]. National and international reporting of forest biomass and carbon has traditionally relied upon field measurements from National Forest Inventory (NFI) programs [2]. However, these approaches cannot provide a continuous spatial distribution of forest biomass at the landscape scale, since field measurements often have limited spatial and temporal coverage, especially for large jurisdictions or remote areas [3]. To address this problem, researchers and practitioners often combine field measurements with remote sensing data to estimate forest biomass across large areas. Many studies have recently demonstrated the ability of lidar (light detection and ranging) data in providing high accuracy estimates of forest biomass and structure [4,5,6,7,8,9,10]. Lidar can be integrated with forest inventory data to make lidar-based biomass maps where data is available wall-to-wall [7,8,9,11,12], or to create lidar-based plots to support forest inventory where data are discrete available as sample transects [13,14]. Lidar-based plots can then be fused with larger coverage data, such as satellite imagery, to facilitate mapping forest biomass and structure at the land management scale [15,16,17,18,19,20]. However, while lidar is often available over forests in developed regions such as North America, such data is generally not available in developing regions, due to its high acquisition costs and advanced computational requirements. The immediate need of biomass estimations across large forest areas, therefore, relies on field-based inventories and multi-spectral remote sensing data provided by satellites such as Landsat and Sentinel. The free availability of the entire historic Landsat archive (since 2008) makes it a popular remotely sensed data source for mapping current forest biomass, as well as monitoring forest biomass dynamics across space and time. The Landsat archive provides a 40-year collection of satellite imagery (since 1972) at a spatial resolution sufficient for capturing changes in forests [21]. This has facilitated the development of many approaches that utilize Landsat time-series imagery to characterize forest change [22,23]. Information from Landsat time-series has been widely used in many studies to estimate forest biomass and other structure attributes across large areas (e.g., [15,16,19,20,24,25,26,27]). At the conceptual level, Kennedy, Ohmann, Gregory, Roberts, Yang, Bell, Kane, Hughes, Cohen, Powell, Neeti, Larrue, Hooper, Kane, Miller, Perkins, Braaten and Seidl [24] developed a comprehensive forest biomass monitoring framework that is based on the analysis of Landsat time-series. Studies have also demonstrated the utility of Landsat time-series in improving forest biomass and structure estimates in comparison with methods that conventionally rely on single-date Landsat images [6,9,16,28]. For example, Pflugmacher, Cohen and E. Kennedy [9] indicated that the inclusion of spectral disturbance and recovery metrics extracted from Landsat time-series can improve biomass model results. More recently, Bolton, White, Wulder, Coops, Hermosilla and Yuan [16] demonstrated that time series metrics such as long-term Landsat spectral means and variability can also describe long-term forest dynamics. The inclusion of time series metrics not only improves the accuracy of empirical models but also makes spatial predictions of forest attributes more consistent with ecological changes such as those resulting from forest disturbance and recovery processes [19].In forest mapping applications, k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN) imputation has been commonly used to leverage forest attributes of interest (response variables), derived from sample plot data, with spatial metrics (predictor variables), derived from remote sensing data, to generate spatial predictions of forest attributes (e.g., [15,16,19,24,29,30]). kNN imputation is a non-parametric and multivariate modelling method that aims to impute (or share) values of response variables from measured samples to target samples where response variables have not been observed (e.g., pixels covering an area of interest) [31]. Imputation associated with each target sample is based on the similarity (evaluated using a distance metric) between values of predictor variables associated with that target pixel and those associated with k nearest training samples. The imputed value of each target sample is assigned as the observed value of a particular training sample if k = 1, and as the average of observed values associated to k nearest training samples if k > 1. Using k values greater than 1 often produces more accurate imputation results than using k = 1, but increases the bias/variance between imputed and observed values, which is an important consideration when comparing the performance of imputation models [31,32]. There are several common techniques to derive a nearest neighbour distance metric (hereafter, distance technique), including weighted Euclidean distance based techniques, such as Most Similar Neighbour (MSN) [33], or Gradient Nearest Neighbour (GNN) [34], and machine learning based methods such as Random Forest (RF) [35]. In fact, MSN is the configuration consisting of the canonical correlation analysis and k = 1 [33], and GNN is the configuration consisting of the canonical correspondence analysis and k = 1 [34]. However, several studies also used these techniques with k > 1 [36]. Some studies have compared kNN distance techniques [31,32,37]. Hudak, Crookston, Evans, Hall and Falkowski [31] compared several kNN distance techniques for imputing plot-level response variables (basal area and tree density) using airborne lidar data in small case study areas. The study found that the RF technique performed best in comparison with GNN and MSN. Eskelson, Temesgen, Lemay, Barrett, Crookston and Hudak [32] also found that RF outperformed other techniques when estimating current forest attributes from inventory data. As the kNN imputation method has been increasingly used in mapping forest biomass, it is critical for land managers and researchers to identify which distance technique performs better at regional and national scales.Another important consideration when developing a kNN model is the method used for imputing biomass variables. This can be divided into two groups: direct and indirect imputation methods. In the direct method, forest biomass variables are included in kNN models as response variables and are thus directly imputed based on their relationship with predictor variables [30,37,38,39,40]. In the indirect method, however, kNN models are trained by response variables other than biomass [15,19,24]. These response variables are often forest structure attributes extracted from inventory plots, such as basal area, stem density and stem volume. Alternatively, variables may be measured from lidar-based plots such as mean vegetation height and percentage of returns [19]. Biomass variables are then attached as ancillary variables to the imputation predictions for target samples. That is, the nearest neighbours for each target sample are found based on the relationship between structure attributes and predictor variables and then are indirectly transferred to biomass variables. For instance, Kennedy, Ohmann, Gregory, Roberts, Yang, Bell, Kane, Hughes, Cohen, Powell, Neeti, Larrue, Hooper, Kane, Miller, Perkins, Braaten and Seidl [24], following Ohmann and Gregory [34], developed GNN imputation models to link a variety of plot-level measures including basal area by species and tree size classes with Landsat-based predictor variables. Using GNN models, each pixel was assigned tree measurements from an inventory plot, resulting in inventory-like maps, from which forest biomass was mapped. As the abovementioned studies were conducted in different locations and used different data sources, it is difficult to compare the imputation methods used for estimating forest biomass. Currently, there is no general agreement on whether direct or indirect imputation methods are better for estimating forest biomass from remote sensing data.The main aim of this study is to determine the most accurate imputation approaches for mapping forest biomass at the landscape scale, using remote sensing and inventory data, and in doing so, fill current gaps in the literature. To achieve this, we compare the performance of several imputation approaches used for modelling aboveground forest biomass (AGB) over large areas using Landsat time-series and field plot measurements. In particular, we compare and contrast (1) direct and indirect biomass imputation methods and (2) three commonly used kNN distance techniques (RF, GNN and MSN), for predicting three forest biomass variables (total AGB, AGB of live-standing trees, AGB of dead-standing trees). In addition, we demonstrate and assess the utility of the kNN imputation method for spatially predicting biomass variables across large areas in relation to ecological changes (a 30-year history of forest disturbance, Nguyen, Jones, Soto-Berelov, Haywood and Hislop [23]).", 1.

945,"The study area contains the whole public land forest estate (7.1 million hectares) of Victoria, southeast Australia (Figure 2). Victorian public land forests extend across the state and include two main land tenures: state forests, and national parks and conservation reserves [41]. The area is stratified by eleven main bioregions (Interim Biogeographic Regionalization for Australia or IBRA, Figure 2), each of which has distinct ecological, geological and climatological features [41]. Victorian public forests include a wide range of ecosystems. North-western Victoria is mostly covered by mallee ecosystems, characterised by small woodland (up to 8 m tall) and multi-stemmed forests, on flat to undulating landscapes. In contrast, most ecosystems in the central part of the State are box-ironbark and red gum forests, which have dense to sparse canopies and reach up to 25 m in height. They are found on flat to undulating topography on rocky and auriferous soils. The most widespread and variable forest ecosystem in the study area consists of damp sclerophyll forests, which cover the central and eastern parts of Victoria. In this ecosystem, trees grow on loam, clay loam, and sandy loam soils and heights range from 40 m to 60 m. Distributed mostly in the eastern part of the state are wet and dry sclerophyll forests. The former are the tallest forest ecosystems in Victoria, with trees reaching 75 m or more in height while the later include relatively low and spreading trees that reach a maximum height of 25 m [42]. Forests within the study area have been impacted by a series of disturbance events including fuel reduction burns, wildfires, logging and drought, resulting in significant changes in carbon biomass stocks [23].", 2.

946,"Forest inventory plot data was collected as a part of the Victorian Forest Monitoring Program (VFMP) which is implemented by the Department of Environment, Land, Water, and Planning [43]. The VFMP includes a network of 786 permanent ground circular plots (0.04 ha) randomly distributed across a systematic statewide grid (Figure 2). In each plot, inventory data is collected on large trees, small trees, herbs, shrubs, and woody debris. Further descriptions of sample designs and field measurements can be found in Haywood, Mellor and Stone [43]. In this study, we extracted data from 633 VFMP plots measured between 2011 and 2016 and calculated nine tree-level forest biomass and structure variables (Table 1). Following Haywood and Stone [44], we estimated AGB (Mg·ha−1) of all large live-standing trees (AGBlive_tree, ≥10 cm in diameter at breast height—DBH) using a generic allometric equation for sclerophyll forests [45] of the form:

In addition to biomass variables, we calculated some structural measures that are summaries of tree measurements in each plot, including basal area (BA), stem density (TD, number of trees per hectare), and tree volume (VL) of both live- and dead-standing trees (Table 1).", 2.

947,"The candidate predictor variables included Landsat-based metrics as well as topographic and climatic ancillary data (Table 2). Landsat-based variables consisted of spectral indices and change metrics derived from the analysis of Landsat time-series.  2.3.1. Landsat Time-SeriesThe study area is covered by 19 Landsat WRS-2 tiles ranging from row 84 to 87, and path 90 to 96 (Figure 2). From the USGS archive, we processed all available Level-1 Terrain Corrected (L1T) Landsat TM/ETM+ images acquired within a pre-defined southern hemisphere summer window (from December to the end of February) from 1987 to 2016. Annual anniversary-date, best observation mosaic composites were created for the 30-year time period using all cloud-free observations within the summer window. For more details on image processing, please see Nguyen, Jones, Soto-Berelov, Haywood and Hislop [23]. For each composite of surface reflectance, we calculated the Normalized Burn Ratio index (NBR) [46], and the Tasselled-cap (TC) components of Greenness (TCG), Brightness (TCB), and Wetness (TCW) [47]. We also computed TC angle (TCA = arctan (TCG/TCB), Powell, Cohen, Healey, Kennedy, Moisen, Pierce and Ohmann [38]) and TC distance (

, Duane, et al. [48]).To derive spectral trends for each pixel, we analysed annual NBR time-series using the LandTrendr temporal segmentation algorithm developed by Kennedy, et al. [49]. Similar to other studies (e.g., [49,50,51,52]), we found that NBR was the most sensitive spectral index for capturing forest disturbance from Landsat time-series [53]. The core segmentation process includes two steps: finding vertices and fitting trends. The first step establishes the vertex years that define temporal breakpoints, reducing year to year noise over the time series. The second step determines the best straight-line trajectory that fits through those vertices, resulting in a fitted spectral trajectory for each pixel within the processing area (Figure 3). From the NBR fitted trajectories, we computed a suite of change metrics representing disturbance and recovery trends for each pixel (Table 2). We first labelled the greatest disturbance segment which corresponds with the greatest negative change magnitude. We then identified the subsequent recovery segment as the monotonic positive segment following the greatest disturbance (Figure 3). More details can be found in Nguyen, Jones, Soto-Berelov, Haywood and Hislop [23]. These two segments were then used to derive disturbance and recovery metrics that represent year, duration, and spectral magnitude of change, as well as pre- and post-change spectral conditions [19,20,23,50]. We also calculated the number of years since the greatest disturbance (or time since disturbance, TSD) to the last year of the time-series (2016). However, for this metric, we applied an additional rule that set the TSD of all un-changed pixels to 50 years. TSD is an important predictor of the regrowth of forests following disturbance. However, since we only had disturbance data for the last 30 years, we assigned non-disturbed pixels a value of 50, to represent mature forests. This was done so as not to confuse the model with a value of 0, for example, which might be interpreted incorrectly. Although 50 was a somewhat arbitrary value, in these forests, it was considered sufficient to represent mature forests. Using disturbance and recovery metrics, we developed classification models to predict disturbance severity levels (high, medium and low; with a high level disturbance resulting in the full removal of trees in forests) and associated causal agents [23]. These data were also included as predictor variables in biomass models in this study, resulting in 15 change metrics in total. A spatial filtering process was applied to the derived change metrics to select only pixels within forested areas and remove change events smaller than 0.5 ha [23].  2.3.2. Topographic and Climatic Ancillary DataTopographic variables including elevation and slope were derived from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 1 arc-second resolution (~30 m) dataset [54]. Mean annual temperature and mean total rainfall were extracted from the Global Climate Data (WorldClim) with a spatial resolution of 1 km [55]. These datasets were obtained and resampled to a spatial resolution of 30 m, to match that of Landsat.", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.3. Predictor Variables,2

From the NBR fitted trajectories, we computed a suite of change metrics representing disturbance and recovery trends for each pixel (Table 2). We first labelled the greatest disturbance segment which corresponds with the greatest negative change magnitude. We then identified the subsequent recovery segment as the monotonic positive segment following the greatest disturbance (Figure 3). More details can be found in Nguyen, Jones, Soto-Berelov, Haywood and Hislop [23]. These two segments were then used to derive disturbance and recovery metrics that represent year, duration, and spectral magnitude of change, as well as pre- and post-change spectral conditions [19,20,23,50]. We also calculated the number of years since the greatest disturbance (or time since disturbance, TSD) to the last year of the time-series (2016). However, for this metric, we applied an additional rule that set the TSD of all un-changed pixels to 50 years. TSD is an important predictor of the regrowth of forests following disturbance. However, since we only had disturbance data for the last 30 years, we assigned non-disturbed pixels a value of 50, to represent mature forests. This was done so as not to confuse the model with a value of 0, for example, which might be interpreted incorrectly. Although 50 was a somewhat arbitrary value, in these forests, it was considered sufficient to represent mature forests. Using disturbance and recovery metrics, we developed classification models to predict disturbance severity levels (high, medium and low; with a high level disturbance resulting in the full removal of trees in forests) and associated causal agents [23]. These data were also included as predictor variables in biomass models in this study, resulting in 15 change metrics in total. A spatial filtering process was applied to the derived change metrics to select only pixels within forested areas and remove change events smaller than 0.5 ha [23]. ", 2.

Mean annual temperature and mean total rainfall were extracted from the Global Climate Data (WorldClim) with a spatial resolution of 1 km [55]. These datasets were obtained and resampled to a spatial resolution of 30 m, to match that of Landsat.", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.3.2. Topographic and Climatic Ancillary Data,2
950," 2.4.1. Variable ExtractionFor each inventory plot location, we extracted the values from the prepared predictor variables (Table 2) associated with the single Landsat pixel that contained the plot centre. Although extracting values from a kernel size, such as a 3 × 3 pixel window, minimises the spatial mismatch between spatial data and inventory plots, the use of the single Landsat pixel allows us to capture the specific disturbance history associated with each inventory plot. Earlier research has shown that a disturbance may impact pixels within a plot in different ways [23]. For example, a fire may have a higher severity in a given pixel than its adjacent pixels. To reduce the mismatch between plot condition at the time of field measurement and time of image acquisition, the Landsat-index variables were extracted from the composite images with the dates that closely coincided with plot measurement dates. Values of change metrics for each disturbed plot were calculated for the time period from 1987 to the plot observation year. In addition, we identified and removed potential outliers to improve data quality. Outliers were defined as plots associated with edge effects such as adjacent water or roads. This removed approximately 8% of the of inventory plots.  2.4.2. Variable SelectionAs reducing the number of predictor variables can avoid detrimental impacts on kNN imputation accuracy, the preliminary modelling step was to determine an optimal set of predictor variables. To achieve this, we first ran the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO, Efron, et al. [56]) model to rank all predictor variables based on their importance to each response variable. The LASSO model quantifies the strength of the relationship between predictor variables and response variables using a pseudo R2 metric that ranges from 0 to 1. The importance rankings of predictor variables for individual response variables were made based on this metric. Predictor variables with consistently low rankings were excluded from further analyses. Redundant variables (or highly correlated variables) were also identified and removed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients between all pairs of remaining variables and removing those with r > 0.9.  2.4.3. Imputation ModelsWe developed and compared different kNN (with k = 1) imputation approaches to predict three biomass measurements (AGBtotal, AGBlive_tree, AGBdead_tree) based on several combinations of response variables and distance techniques. For each of the three distance techniques (RF, GNN, or MSN), we developed six model scenarios using different groups of response variables (Table 3), resulting in 18 kNN models in total. The first model scenario (BM) was the direct biomass imputation model since it was trained by biomass response variables (AGBtotal, AGBlive_tree and AGBdead_tree). The nearest neighbour was found by directly relating observed biomass variables to predictor variables. In contrast, the other five model scenarios (BA, TD, VL, BA-TD and VL-TD) were the indirect biomass imputation models, as the nearest neighbour was found based on the relationships between predictor variables and forest structure variables rather than biomass variables. Biomass measurements of the corresponding training plots were not included in these models but were subsequently attached as ancillary variables to impute each target pixel. The combination of BA and VL was not included in our analysis since these variables are highly correlated. The Pearson correlation coefficient between BAlive_tree and VLlive_tree was 0.91 and between BAdead_tree and VLdead_tree was 0.96. GNN and MSN identify the nearest neighbour based on weighted Euclidean distance techniques. The MSN technique computes the distance in projected canonical space while the GNN technique computes distance using a projected ordination of predictors based on canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) [33,34]. The distance metric in RF, on the other hand, is derived based on a proximity matrix [35]. The elements of the proximity matrix contain the proportion of decision trees where both training and target samples are found in the same terminal node. The statistical distance metric is calculated as one minus that proportion [57]. After testing with different model parameters, we set the number of trees (ntree) to 200 for each RF model (associated with each response variable), and the number of predictor variables selected at each node (mtry) to the default, based on the square root of the number of predictors. These values were chosen since they minimized the model errors (RMSE) within the training dataset. Since kNN imputation creates multiple RF models associated with the number of response variables and shares the number of trees across the individual models, the input parameter of ntree of kNN model was actually 200 multiplied by the number of response variables. We built our models using the R-package yaImpute [57].  2.4.4. Model EvaluationWe evaluated the accuracy of each model scenario using a leave-one-out cross validation approach. For each sample plot, models were trained by all data except the candidate plot which was then treated as a target observation. Errors were computed for each withheld sample and averaged to evaluate model performance. For each biomass variable, imputed values were compared to observed values using the generalised root mean square difference (gRMSD, RMSE divided by the standard deviation of the observed values under the assumption that they are representative of the population, Crookston and Finley [57]), and relative mean deviation (rMD, Gorard [58]) which is a measure of bias:

Assessment of Biomass Imputation Maps Using Disturbance HistoryAfter evaluating the accuracy metrics, we selected the kNN model that consistently performed well across the biomass response variables, to implement spatial imputations (k = 1) to forested pixels across the study area for the year 2016. We assessed the ability of the selected kNN model to predict forest biomass in relation to disturbance history throughout the 30-year time-series (1987–2016). To facilitate this, we created a reference dataset containing 7860 reference points (with a minimum distance of 250 m between them) across the study area [59]. These points were built around the VFMP inventory plot network (10 points around each plot), thus they were also stratified according to bioregions (Figure 2). Points that fell on the boundary of land cover types, or at the edge of disturbances were shifted away from the edge to avoid mis-registration errors. Reference points were then interpreted and attributed with disturbance severity levels (high, medium and low), and associated causal agents (fire, logging and other) using a multiple-lines of evidence approach. For a detailed explanation of the multiple lines of evidence approach, see Soto-Berelov, Haywood, Jones, Hislop and Nguyen [59]. Some points that fell in non-forest areas, defined following Nguyen, et al. [60], were removed from the dataset. From the kNN imputed maps, we extracted the mean values from a 3 × 3 pixel window around each reference pixel, for each of the biomass response variables. As the range of biomass often varies across forest ecosystems, it is not appropriate to compare reference points from different bioregions using imputed biomass values. Thus, we grouped the random points by bioregion and then scaled biomass values for each set from 0 to 100 (corresponding with low to high biomass in each bioregion). To examine the relationship between scaled biomass values and recent disturbance events, we selected reference points that had been disturbed by fire and logging events that occurred between 2013 and 2016. The main reason for choosing this time period is that, for non-stand replacing disturbance events occurring in over three years prior to the mapping date (2016), the evidence of their impacts on biomass maps may not be clear as forests may have regrown [61]. Trends and variation of biomass associated with these points were then analysed according to disturbance severity level and causal agent using boxplots. In addition, we assessed biomass patterns according to time since disturbance or TSD, for each disturbance severity level. This analysis was completed for all disturbances occurring within the time-series (1987–2016). We first stratified TSD into nine intervals (0–3, 3–6, 6–9, 9–12, 12–15, 15–18, and 18–26 years). The basis of this division was to illuminate the trend of biomass according to TSD. A shorter interval (3 years) was applied for TSD smaller than 18 years since forests often significantly change/grow during this period. We then grouped the disturbance points using these TSD intervals and by disturbance severity levels, and calculated the mean of the scaled biomass values for each group.", 2.

957,"The results of biomass model assessment varied across model scenarios, imputation techniques (RF, GNN and MSN) and the biomass variables (AGBtotal, AGBlive_tree and AGBdead_tree). Figure 5 shows the pattern of gRMSD across all tested models. It clearly indicates that RF consistently outperformed MSN and GNN distance techniques in terms of gRMSD. Across biomass models, AGBtotal consistently achieved lower gRMSD values (ranging from 0.74 to 1.34) than AGBlive_tree (0.88–1.39) and AGBdead_tree (1.08–1.42). The lowest gRMSD values across biomass variables were reported by RF-based BM, BA and VL models, while the highest values were reported by GNN-based BA and TD models. In addition, model scenarios performed differently across imputation techniques. For example, the BM model scenario achieved the lowest errors when using RF and MSN but not when using GNN. The BA model scenario showed better performance than the other model scenarios when using RF but it was one of the worst performings when using GNN. The VL-TD model scenario reported lower error rates than the other model scenarios when using MSN or GNN techniques but higher when using RF. TD was the worst performing model scenario regardless of distance techniques. The patterns in model-strength indicated by rMD were relatively similar to those illustrated by gRMSD (Figure 6). RF performed much better than the other distance techniques and rMD values were generally lower for AGBtotal and AGBlive_tree (ranging from 0.26 to 6.44 for AGBtotal, from 0.03 to 6.46 for AGBlive_tree, and from 0.55 to 6.45 for AGBdead_tree). The lowest values associated with AGBtotal and AGBlive_tree were achieved by the RF-based BA model while the lowest value associated with AGBdead_tree was obtained by the RF-based TD model. The highest values were reported by GNN-based BA and TD models. Similar to gRMSD, the patterns of rMD indicate that model scenarios show varied performances across distance techniques and biomass variables. When using RF, the BA model scenario reported lower error rates for AGBtotal and AGBlive_tree (0.26 and 0.03, respectively) than the other model scenarios. When using MSN and GNN distance techniques, however, lower error rates were reported by TD and VL-TD model scenarios, respectively.

958,"Based on model comparisons, we selected the model trained by the combination of basal area and stem density variables (RF-based BA-TD model) to produce imputation maps of biomass for 2016, across the study area (Figure 7). This model reported relatively and consistently low error rates across both accuracy metrics (gRMSD and rMD) and all three biomass variables (Figure 8). For all biomass variables, the model over- and under-predicted low and high observed biomass values, respectively. The imputation maps of forest biomass show clear longitudinal trends at the state level, with lower biomass in northwestern mallee forests and higher in southeast sclerophyll forests (Figure 7a). At the local scale, biomass predictions are spatially consistent with ground conditions of forests, accurately capturing evidence of recent forest disturbance (Figure 7b–e). Predictions of biomass showed relatively consistent trends in relation to the severity of recent (2013–2016) fire and logging disturbance events (Figure 9). For all three biomass variables, high severity disturbance consistently resulted in low biomass predictions. Scaled biomass values were generally higher when relating to lower disturbance levels (medium and low severity), excepting small trends in AGBtotal and AGBlive_tree associated with low severity logging. In addition, fire disturbed areas indicated slightly lower scaled biomass values in comparison with logged areas. The trends of biomass predictions in relation to TSD varied across disturbance severity levels and biomass variables (Figure 10). Similar to the analysis on recent disturbances, the analysis on all disturbances within the 30-year time-series indicated that biomass predictions associated with low severity disturbance were generally higher than those associated with medium and high severity disturbance. For high and medium severity levels, scaled biomass values were generally higher with increased TSD. For the low severity level, on the other hand, scaled biomass values were generally stable across TSD intervals. However, these trends were not linear. There was a substantial increase in biomass predictions within the 3–6 and 6–9 years TSD intervals across all disturbance severity levels and biomass variables.", 3. Results, 3.3. Biomass Imputation Maps in Relation to Disturbance History,3
959,"Studies have demonstrated different kNN imputation approaches for the empirical estimation of forest AGB using remotely sensed time-series and forest inventory data. However, different approaches can produce markedly different results. Thus, knowledge of which approach is the most appropriate is needed for land managers and researchers. In this study, we compared several kNN-based imputation approaches for estimating forest biomass using Landsat time-series and field plot measurements. Specifically, we evaluated three commonly used kNN distance techniques: RF, MSN and GNN, and two biomass imputation methods: direct and indirect imputation. While a few studies have compared the performance of different distance techniques used in kNN imputation models [31,32], none of them conducted their comparisons by leveraging multispectral time-series data and forest inventory data. Furthermore, there is no existing literature demonstrating whether biomass variables should be included as response variables and directly imputed, or be indirectly imputed from models built upon other structure variables. In addition, we evaluated the utility of kNN imputation models built upon Landsat time-series and inventory data by conducting ecological validations of imputed biomass maps. Our results indicate that the accuracy of kNN biomass imputation models (k = 1) varies with different distance metrics. Models based on the RF distance technique, which calculates the distance metric based on a proximity matrix, generally outperformed those based on MSN and GNN distance techniques. As shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, RF-based models consistently achieved lower error rates of biomass imputation (in both gRMSD and rMD values) as compared to MSN and GNN-based models. These results agree with previous studies that compared imputation techniques for modelling forest attributes [31,32]. In addition, we found the performance of RF-based models to be relatively stable while that of MSN-and GNN-based models tended to be inconsistent across varied model scenarios. The rMD value associated with AGBtotal reported by RF-based models ranged from 0.26 to 0.54, while the range reported by MSN and GNN-based models were significantly higher (from 0.45 to 2.59 and from 1.87 to 6.44, respectively, Figure 6). The results also indicate the influence of the number of response variables included in kNN biomass imputation models on the performance of different distance techniques. In general, RF-based models were not significantly impacted by the number of response variables, given the models with four response variables (RF-based BA-TD and VL-TD models) achieved comparable accuracies to those with two variables (such as RF-based BA and VL models). This could be due to the small number of response variables (2 to 4) included in our RF-based models. Previous studies used a larger number of variables and found that RF works optimally with few variables and when factors are used rather than continuous values [31,57]. In contrast to RF, GNN-based models performed significantly better with an increased number of response variables. Error rates reported by GNN-based models were highest for models with two response variables (such as GNN-based BA and TD models) and lowest for those with four response variables (GNN-based BA-TD and VL-TD models). This compares favourably with other studies [34,62]. The performance of MSN-based models varied with the number of response variables, making it difficult to identify a specific trend. As our models included a relatively small number of response variables, further work is needed to investigate the impact of the number of response variables on the performance of kNN imputation with different distance techniques.Among indirect biomass imputation model scenarios (BA, VL, TD, BA-TD, and VL-TD), models trained by basal area or stem volume variables generally achieved better accuracy than those trained by stem density variables (Figure 5 and Figure 6). This was expected, since basal area and stem volume variables are often more correlated with the biomass variables than stem density variables. However, models with only basal area or stem volume response variables (BA and VL scenarios) often produced unbalanced accuracies across biomass ranges, exhibiting high bias for the dead biomass variable (AGBdead_tree, Figure 6). The inclusion of stem density variables (BA-TD and VL-TD scenarios) significantly reduced this bias, balancing accuracy across all biomass variables. rMD values associated with AGBdead_tree reported by BA and VL models ranged from 2.12 to 6.35 while those reported by BA-TD and VL-TD models ranged from 0.71 to 3.27 (with an exception of 5.54 from GNN-based VL-TD model). The determination of whether direct or indirect imputation method is better for forest biomass estimation depends on the distance technique used in the kNN model. Although the direct biomass imputation model (BM model scenario) performs relatively well across different distance techniques, it is not always the best method for estimating biomass variables. When the MSN distance technique is applied, the BM model scenario performed better overall than the indirect model scenarios given it consistently reports lower errors for all three biomass variables. The next best is the BA-TD model scenario which produced slightly higher errors for total and live tree AGB but lower errors for dead tree AGB (Figure 5 and Figure 6). When using the RF distance technique, however, the BM model scenario did not perform as well as the BA and BA-TD scenarios. Although the BM model scenario achieved the lowest gRMSD values (0.74 and 0.88 for AGBtotal and AGBlive_tree, respectively), it produced greater bias than the BA and BA-TD model scenarios. In particular, the rMD values reported by the BM model scenario ranged from 0.48 to 6.33 while those reported by BA and BA-TD were from 0.03 to 4.84 and from 0.33 to 3.27, respectively (Figure 6). Despite a relatively high rMD value for AGBdead_tree (4.84), it is reasonable to consider BA as the best model scenario for imputing AGB variables when applying the RF distance technique. The results from GNN-based models indicate the superior performance of VL-TD and BA-TD model scenarios. The model trained by stem volume and stem density variables (VL-TD) obtained the lowest errors for total and live tree AGB but high errors for dead tree AGB. Whereas, the model trained by basal area and stem density variables (BA-TD) achieved more consistent results across all three biomass variables (Figure 5 and Figure 6). These results suggest that BA-TD is the most robust model scenario for imputing forest biomass given it maintains the most consistent performance across the tested distance techniques and biomass variables. Overall, the indirect imputation method, particularly kNN models trained using a combination of basal area and stem density variables, achieved better biomass estimates than the direct imputation method. It is important to note that we developed and compared the kNN models using the single nearest neighbour (k = 1). This makes the comparison consistent and our methods and results applicable in other study areas/contexts. While increasing k (to an optimal value) reduces the imputation error, the determination of an optimal k value is often difficult and depends on many factors including distance metrics, response variables and forest environments [32,36]. Maintaining consistent parameters (i.e., k value) and methods allows the imputation results to be evaluated more effectively [32]. We note also, that the use of a single nearest neighbour has been increasing in forest applications with kNN models, particularly in biomass estimation [15,16,19,29,36,63]. Chirici, Mura, McInerney, Py, Tomppo, Waser, Travaglini and McRoberts [36] found in their review work that k = 1 is the most common selection to use with MSN and GNN techniques. This is reasonable since these techniques are initially created to use with the single nearest neighbour, as mentioned in the introduction. Recent studies using the RF technique also often selected k = 1 for their imputation models [16,19,63]. As forest inventory programs are increasingly developed systematically, measurements from inventory plots are representatives of forest populations [64]. The use of k = 1 is thus recommended to keep variance in the imputations similar to variance in the observations. Although further work is required to examine how higher k values impact the comparison results, we strongly believe that RF would outperform MSN and GNN distance techniques, regardless of the k values used. Our results indicate that RF was the most accurate distance technique, thus the selection of the best kNN imputation model for mapping biomass variables was between the RF-based BA and BA-TD models. The former was most accurate for AGBtotal and AGBlive_tree estimates, while the latter resulted in a more balanced performance across all three biomass variables. Our biomass maps were predicted using the BA-TD model as we aimed to focus on both live and dead biomass pools (Figure 8). Results from the model showed that AGBtotal and AGBlive_tree achieved better accuracies than AGBdead_tree. This supports the results of other studies, which have demonstrated that the total and live biomass variables often have better relationships with Landsat spectral values than dead biomass [6,9,65]. Spatial predictions of biomass were consistent with the distribution of different forest systems across the state (as described in Section 2.1), with low productivity in the low-spare mallee forests in the northwest and high productivity in the high-dense sclerophyll forests in the southeast (Figure 7). Predictions of biomass were relatively consistent with the 30-year disturbance history of forests within the study area (Figure 9 and Figure 10). Forest dynamics within the study area are dominated by fire and logging disturbances. When relating current predictions of forest biomass with recent disturbance events, we found that increased disturbance severity was consistently associated with decreased biomass predictions (Figure 9). The reduction of dead tree AGB after a high severe fire is expected given we defined a high level disturbance as the full removal of trees in forests [23]. This trend was also evident in the analysis based on all disturbances occurring from 1988 to 2016 (Figure 10) and is consistent with findings from other studies [19,26]. In addition, the results also suggest that predicted biomass was more sensitive to fire than to logging disturbance (Figure 9). This should be expected as un-wanted parts of logged trees (such as branches and stumps) and small trees often remained in forests after a selective logging event. Although current predictions of biomass are more variable when relating to time since disturbance (TSD), the trends were relatively consistent with post-disturbance forest recovery. Biomass values were often lowest within 0 to 3 years following a disturbance and generally reached an asymptotic level at 18–26 years after disturbance (Figure 10). Within Victorian forests, fires often cause high rates of tree mortality, which can exist for many years after a fire, resulting in increased trends in dead tree biomass [44]. In general, biomass predictions showed relatively high values within 3–9 years after a disturbance. This trend was consistent across the biomass variables and disturbance severity levels (Figure 10). The reason for this could be that Landsat spectra and indices are known to saturate at relatively low leaf area and biomass levels. These can be attained only a few years post-disturbance [61]. This also suggests that the uncertainty of predicted biomass maps can be informed by forest disturbance history. Our analysis on variable selection further clarifies the benefits of including change metrics from Landsat time-series to improve predictions of forest biomass. To our knowledge, this is the first time spatial change metrics extracted from Landsat data have been combined with the systematic network of forest inventory, across large areas of sclerophyll forests in Victoria, Australia. Our results from the variable importance analysis were consistent with those from previous studies [6,9,16,19,20,63]. Spectral indices such as NBR and TCA were the most important variables overall, and change metrics such as disturbance and recovery magnitude, and TSD, were particularly important for modelling dead biomass and structure variables. Similar to Zald, Wulder, White, Hilker, Hermosilla, Hobart and Coops [19], our results indicate that change attribution variables (disturbance level and causal agent) are less important since fire is the dominant disturbance within the study area. However, these metrics may greatly benefit kNN imputation models by distinguishing pixels with similar spectral information [19,63].", 4. Discussion,None,4
960,"The kNN imputation method is increasingly used to combine remote sensing data with ground sample plots to produce spatially explicit predictions of forest biomass at the landscape scale. While studies have demonstrated different kNN imputation approaches for estimating forest biomass, there is currently no consensus on which method is most appropriate when integrating multispectral time-series with field inventory data. This study addresses this gap by comparing different kNN distance techniques (with k = 1) and biomass imputation methods (direct and indirect). We found that the best results of forest biomass predictions can be achieved using the indirect imputation method rather than the direct method. In addition, our results confirm that RF outperforms GNN and MSN distance techniques in biomass imputation models. Our recommendation is that land managers and researchers should consider using a RF-based kNN imputation model that incorporates Landsat-based time-series metrics with forest structure variables (basal area and stem density) for estimating forest biomass.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
961,"As a consequence of the rapid increase in forest management and resource extraction, an increase in the abundance of narrow-linear canopy openings such as roads, powerlines, oil and gas pipelines, etc. can be observed over the past century in forested areas throughout the world [1]. Road networks now criss-cross much of the temperate and boreal forest regions. For example, in the United States there are more than 6.3 million km of roads in forests [2], British Columbia (Canada) has an estimated total of 400,000–550,000 km of unpaved forest roads [3], and Quebec annually builds an estimated 4000–5000 km of forest roads [4]. In order to understand their overall impact on the forest, it is necessary to evaluate the distance of influence of edge effects from these openings. Earlier studies have reported a large array of distance effects from edges ranging from tens to thousands of meters depending on the metric evaluated and the study region [5,6,7]. Linear openings have a high edge to area ratio which given their omnipresence should lead to large effects across vast managed forest regions.As with other openings, linear corridors cause breaks in otherwise continuous interior forest habitat thereby creating an abrupt forest edge where ecological changes in energy flow, wildlife movement, seed dispersal, and abiotic conditions occur [6,7,8]. Changes in abiotic conditions affect forest structure and composition through increased edge-tree mortality and/or seedling recruitment that can further influence the original abiotic edge effect [6,9,10]. Increases in resources such as light could also lead to greater tree growth and thus higher forest productivity [11,12] or greater structural diversity [13] adjacent to edges. These effects on adjacent vegetation, depending on the distance of the effects, have influences on both wildlife habitat and forestry (i.e., increased mortality vs. increased growth) [14,15]. The intensity and distance of edge effects is influenced by attributes such as age, history, type, and orientation of the linear openings. Burton [16] has also shown that the geographic position or orientation, especially North vs. South sides of an opening, affects forest stem density.In recent years there has also been an emphasis on minimizing the difference between the effects of natural and anthropogenic disturbances on forests in order to maintain ecological processes and biodiversity [17]. This is based on the precept that organisms are adapted to conditions that have occurred naturally for thousands of years [18]. In the case of comparing forest harvesting to natural disturbances, recent years have seen a wealth of information developed. However, as important as roads and other anthropogenic linear openings are in dissecting forests, little understanding has been developed as to their similarities and differences with natural linear opening such as streams. In many forested regions, natural linear openings, such as streams, are abundant. Forest surrounding these openings established in their presence whereas anthropogenic openings were cut into pre-existing forest. The initial forested condition, i.e., natural forest dissected by anthropogenic openings or forest that developed around liner features such as streams, may influence tree response. With this in mind, we thus ask whether anthropogenic linear openings (roads and power lines) are analogues to streams in terms of their effects on surrounding forest conditions. Further, we assess how far effects on forest structure (density, height, gap fraction, and regeneration) extend into the surrounding forests and if they vary according to opening type (natural or anthropogenic).Edge effects are usually measured on-site, using transects and sampling plots as a basis for determining changes in vegetation composition or function [10,13,19]. As linear openings cover long distances across a landscape, it can be difficult to acquire comprehensive tree and canopy level information for a wide band of adjacent forests, using on-site measurements. This may limit our ability to confidently estimate the full extent of edge affected area, as well as characterizing their cumulative impact, with researchers forced to study a small number of plots instead of large continuous areas. To understand change from the edge-to-interior gradient, it is important to capture the variability along a continuous and sufficiently long distance parallel to the edge in question instead of making discrete measurements along a transect. Remote sensing may contribute to resolve these limitations, as it covers contiguous forested area. In recent years, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) have offered promising ways to obtain detailed information on vegetation structure at several vertical and horizontal scales [20,21,22]. To replace discontinuous ground observations, we thus use canopy height models (CHM, a surface describing the distribution of canopy height across space) generated from high density discrete LiDAR to extract individual stem measurements and canopy gaps.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
962,"The study area is located in the Quebec North Shore region (49°30′–50°00′ N; 67°30′–69°00′ W), (Figure 1a). The closest meteorological station is at Baie-Comeau, 50 km south of the study area. The climate is considered cold and maritime with a mean annual temperature of 1.4 °C and a mean annual precipitation of 1018 mm where 70% of this total occurs as rainfall [23]. Topography is characterized as hilly with moderate slopes (<30%). Summits are rounded or mostly flat, with elevation varying between 500–700 m. Rocky outcrops occupy close to 40% of the area and are present on summits, close to water bodies, and on steep slopes. Undifferentiated glacial tills constitute the majority of the remaining surficial deposits and are found on gentle slopes and in depressions. Glacial fluvial sand deposits occupy the bottom of large valleys along rivers [23].The study area overlaps the Abies balsamea-Betula papyrifera and Picea mariana-moss bioclimatic domains [24] and is within the Chibougamau-Natashquan boreal region [25]. Picea mariana and Abies balsamea are the dominant species in this area. A. balsamea is dominant on mesic sites in the southern part of the range along with B. papyrifera and Populus tremuloides. P. mariana becomes more frequent as latitude increases. Pinus banksiana is a minor species found primarily on sandy soils [23]. The fire cycle is close to 300 years [26] and spruce budworm outbreaks were historically not severe in the region [27,28]. Thus, a large proportion of the area is dominated by old-growth forests, where gap dynamics are driving changes in structure and composition [29]. Gaps generally result from the mortality of a small number of trees and most are smaller than 100 m2 [29]. Although logging dates to the early 1930’s throughout the study area (including the LiDAR flown study sites) large patches of untouched forests (>150 km2) dominate.", 2. Methods, 2.1. Study Area,2
963,"LiDAR data were acquired on 19 June 2010 using an Optec-ALTM 3100 flown at 700 m with a pulse frequency of 100 kHz, a maximum scan angle of 15°, a footprint size of 21 cm, and an average overall return density of 7 hits/m2 were used. This multireturn dataset was calibrated and then classified following the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing guidelines using the TerraScan algorithm by the data provider. The canopy height models (CHM) and LiDAR-derived three-dimensional surfaces that are the vegetation height above the ground surface (Figure 1b–e) of the study forest were generated by calculating the difference between the elevations of the respective canopy surface (digital surface model, DSM) and the underlying terrain (digital terrain model, DTM). DSM and DTM of 0.25 m resolution were created following the method explained in Vepakomma et al. [21].", 2. Methods, 2.2. LiDAR Data,2
964,"We identified anthropogenic and natural linear openings within a LiDAR sample area flown in 2010. The anthropogenic openings were composed of roads and powerline corridors and the natural ones were streams. Powerlines were established in the early 1960s and are wider (90–150 m) than roads (approximately 20 m width). We considered old roads that were established in the late 1950’s to connect Baie-Comeau to the Ste-Anne Reservoir. In this study we sampled 10 ha of contiguous forest bands per linear opening (5 ha on each side of the opening for a minimum length of 500 m parallel to it and running 100 m from the edge of the opening into the forest) (Figure 1e). In the LIDAR data set, two sites for streams and powerlines and three sites for roads, covering a minimum of 16 ha of contiguous forests in each, were available for the analyses. An area of 16 ha of contiguous old-growth forest was considered sufficiently large to encompass the variability generated by gap dynamics, since more than 80% of gaps are smaller than 100 m2 [29]. Thus, such an area would be representative of most of the regional variability observed in old-growth forest, while giving the advantage of analyzing contiguous forest area to detect finer scale transitions in forest structural characteristics.Sites were carefully selected (i) within old growth forests, (ii) on relatively level terrain, (iii) fairly linear with consistent width, (iv) openings that are at least 50 years old, and (v) at least a 300 m distance from large water bodies and any major disturbances (Table 1, Figure 1a). We used all areas falling within the LiDAR acquired region matching the set of criteria presented above. A total of 106 ha of forested area adjoining the linear openings were sampled. In addition to the linear openings, a separate window of size 400 m × 400 m (16 ha) within old-growth forests was selected as a reference forest to describe interior forest conditions in the absence of linear openings (Figure 1a).Since edge effects are expected to be directionally asymmetrical at high latitudes, and wherever winds have a predominant direction [30,31], we also analyzed forest conditions on both sides of each linear opening. Orientation of the linear opening was measured by its inclination from the north (Table 1). “North” refers to the northern fragment of the forest adjoining the opening and hence south-facing to the linear opening.", 2. Methods, 2.3. Site Selection,2
965," 2.4.1. Response Variables and Buffer SegmentsThe influence of linear openings on the adjoining forest was assessed for the following structural variables: overstory structure (average tree height, tree density per ha) and regeneration (average sapling height, sapling density per ha) gap fraction. The effect of the edge-to interior gradient on the adjoining forest was assessed using 50 multi-ring buffers of 2 m width each, parallel to the linear openings. This was done on each side of the linear opening with the use of ArcGIS. The most frequent crown width of the trees sampled was chosen as the buffer segment width (2 m), and over six times the average stem height as the maximum distance to be sampled from a linear opening into the interior forest i.e., 100 m.A stem was considered as a tree if it reached a minimum height of 4 m; otherwise it was a sapling. Average tree and sapling height, tree and sapling density (standardized per ha), and gap fraction, were calculated for each buffer segment. The buffer polygon segments were used to estimate the structural (response) variables along the distance gradient as described below:Average stem height:

where tij, i = 1 to nj, ith tree height in the jth segment which has nj identified canopy trees; Aj: area (in m2) within the jth segment; Gij is the area under the ith gap in the jth segment. 2.4.2. Individual Tree Identification and ValidationIndividual trees were located by first identifying tree tops using local maxima filtered on a Gaussian smoothed CHM and then by delineating the crowns by adopting a marker controlled watershed segmentation on the complement of the CHM [32,33,34]. Local maxima filtering of 0.5 m radius (based on smallest tree size) moving window was used on a Gaussian smoothed CHM to identify markers for segmentation. After segmentation was performed, the position and height of the highest LiDAR return within each tree segment were used as the location of single tree tops and their maximum tree height. A sample of automatically segmented tree stems is shown in Figure 2b.Independent validation of stem identification and tree height using this algorithm for stands in a mixedwood boreal forest [32]. A similar validation was carried out in this study area showed 87.8% identification accuracy and a strong acceptance with an R2 = 0.95, r2 = 0.97, and RMSE = 0.94 m of tree height (see Supplementary Materials for more details). 2.4.3. Gap Definition and DelineationA gap was defined as an area within the forest where crown heights of the tallest stems were noticeably lower than the height of the adjacent canopy [35]. This is assumed to be due to the death of a single or group of trees. Other types of openings such as water bodies, roads, and rock outcrops were not treated as gaps. They were eliminated by applying a minimum canopy height of 0.5 m (a threshold verified independently against high resolution images). Gaps were identified by the absence of trees in the canopy such that the height of any remaining stems was lower than a given absolute height (gh). The gh threshold was fixed based on the canopy height where the relative increase in proportional closed canopy area reaches a maximum and then tends to stabilize. From available ground tree measurements, and LiDAR surfaces of two forested test sites of size 25 ha each within the region, gh was estimated to be 4 m. Individual canopy gaps were then delineated by adopting the automated algorithm described in Vepakomma et al. [21]. Figure 2c presents an example of the automatically delineated gaps in the adjoining remnant forests along the linear openings. 2.4.4. Comparison of Forests around Linear Openings and Reference ForestDifferences in forest structure were tested using Kolmogorov–Smirnov and Mann–Whitney U nonparametric two-sample tests. To assess whether the response variable along the edge-to-interior gradient is significantly different from that of the reference forest, we estimated 95 percent confidence intervals (2.5th and 97.5th percentiles) for each of the variables based on their response in the reference forest. The 16 ha reference forest was divided into 1600 sub-plots of size 100 m2. To remove any sampling bias, we then extracted three sets of 5000 bootstrapped samples of size 1600 (using simple random sampling with replacement) independently for (1) the total number of saplings and total sapling height, (2) the total number of trees and total tree height, and the (3) total gap area. The 2.5th and the 97.5th percentiles of the response variables and 95% confidence intervals were then estimated using their respective 5000 bootstrapped values. Mean values of the response variable along the edge-to-interior gradient of linear opening were considered significant if they were outside the confidence interval of the reference forest. 2.4.5. Depth of Influence—Average CUSUMTo determine the extent of a linear opening’s influence (Depth of influence, DEI) and to find thresholds of changes, we plotted the average cumulative sums (CUSUMs) of the response variable against the distance from the edge of a linear opening. CUSUM methods are process control statistical techniques used to determine changes or shifts over time in a process [36]. More recently to create zones of influence of canopy gap opening on the structure of the surrounding boreal forest matrix [33]. Control charts usually do not detect small shifts in a process, observed say by measuring a change in statistic Q from a desired value k, instead these small shifts appear more like noise around the mean. On the other hand, the slope of the curve from the cumulative sum of such small shifts (as defined below), may be more indicative of how average Q differs from k.

By estimating the cumulative average of a response variable along the distance from the edge (CUAVG) the depth of influence of the linear opening on the adjacent forest is established. The point where the rate of change of CUAVG of the response variable converges to zero is considered to be the distance at which the explanatory variable, and hence the linear opening edge, ceases to have an influence on changes in the response variable.CUAVGj,i, the average of the cumulated value of the jth response variable up to the ith distance from the edge is computed as given below.CUAVG of average stem height:

972,"We evaluated the influence of linear openings on forest structure as measured by canopy gaps, sapling height and density, and tree height and density along a 100 m wide forest band. These were compared to a reference forest. Forest structure significantly differed in the neighborhood of linear openings compared to the reference forest (pairwise Kruskal–Wallis ANOVA by ranks, p < 0.001, Table 2).Reference forests have an average height of 11.93 m, a density of 520 trees/ha and 36 saplings/ha, and a gap fraction of 36%. As compared to reference forests, forests around natural linear openings were taller while around anthropogenic ones they were shorter. Both natural and anthropogenic openings had denser and more disturbed surrounding forests, as compared to reference forests (Table 2). Tree height in the reference forest is normally distributed with a peak around 12–14 m. In these forests, 98% of the trees are higher than 10 m, of which 90% are between 10–16 m (Figure 3). Tree height distribution in the vicinity of linear openings was significantly different from the reference forest (Table 2). In the reference forest tree height distribution tended to be unimodal, narrower, and peaked, whereas for all types and aspects of linear openings tree heights occurred across a wider range (p < 0.001, Figure 3a,b). Tree height distribution on either side of natural openings is skewed more to the left compared to the reference forest, with over 50% of the trees more than 16 m in height (Figure 3c). In comparison, for anthropogenic openings, with the exception of western orientations, distributions appear mostly uniform (Figure 3d,e). In these forests, over 40% (but about 20% in the western aspect) of the trees were below 10 m in height. Furthermore, with the exception of sapling height, all response variables in all linear opening types were significantly beyond the range of variability of the reference forests generated from the bootstrap analysis (Figure 4). Compared to reference forests and irrespective of the type of opening, gap fraction, sapling, and tree density were positive and increased in magnitude with opening width whereas, sapling height, and to a lesser extent tree height, responded negatively (Figure 4a).Canopy gaps are more frequent in forests along the edge-to-interior gradient for all linear opening types (stream, road, and powerline) compared to the reference forest (Table 2, Figure 4). There are fewer saplings close to any type of linear opening but the number of saplings is heterogeneous and consistently increases with distance from the edge (Table 2, Figure 4). Comparing the distribution of each response variable with respect to the critical intervals, only sapling density and gap fraction up to 40 m in all linear opening types significantly matched the reference forest. On the other hand, average sapling height in the reference forest is slightly higher than what is observed in the forests around linear openings and hence has a negative MEI (Figure 5).", 3. Results, 3.1. Reference Forest vs. Forests around Linear Openings,3
973,"Forest structure significantly varied around natural and anthropogenic linear openings. Gap fraction, sapling height, and sapling density were significantly greater near anthropogenic openings whereas, tree height and tree density were significantly greater in forests adjacent to natural openings (Table 2). Although, there was no consistent difference of one orientation affecting structural characteristics more than the other, the western side not only had greater gap fraction and sapling density for both anthropogenic and natural openings, but also greater tree density and tree height around anthropogenic openings (Table 2 and Table S1 and Figure 4). Sapling height for both anthropogenic and natural and tree height for natural openings was, in contrast, greater on the eastern side of the openings. Differences between northern and southern aspects around anthropogenic linear openings were not pronounced for any of the structural variables measured (Table 2).The variation in the structural indices evaluated is especially large in the first 20–30 m from the edge of the opening. Although forests around roads have similar average structural characteristics to forests around natural openings, distributions along distance from the edge are significantly different (KW test, p < 0.01, Table 2 and Figure 4). Forests around power line corridors are shorter in height, more disturbed with a gap fraction of almost 50% and an average tree height below 11 m (Table 2). The MEI of tree height and density around anthropogenic openings was negative with respect to natural ones (Figure 5b). Sapling height was not affected by the type of opening or the orientation.The depth-of-edge influence (DEI) varied considerably among the response variables, from as close as 15 m to almost 80 m deep into the forest (Table S1, Figure 6). Although effects can extend a long distance, changes in most structural indices are greatest in the first ten to fifteen meters from all types of linear openings (Figure 6). The exception to this observation is for sapling height which continues to change rapidly out to or past 40 m for different opening types. However, the rate of change of DEI between 10 and 20 m differed between natural and anthropogenic openings for all the response variables. A high tree density in proximity to the edges (within 10–15 m) resulted in a negative change in the slope of the CUAVG curve in tree height and density. Similarly, increased occurrence of gaps 10 m from the edges resulted in high positive change in the slope of CUAVG curves of gap fraction and sapling density. In general, the impact of natural openings penetrates deeper into the forest than that of anthropogenic openings. Irrespective of the type of the opening, DEI is generally further for gap fraction and sapling density in the western aspect (Figure 6, Table S1 and Figure S1).", 3. Results, 3.2. Natural vs. Anthropogenic Openings,3
974,"Amongst the structural differences that we noted; the forests surrounding anthropogenic openings have a higher gap fraction than around natural openings. Anthropogenic linear developments open otherwise continuous interior forest habitat creating an abrupt forest edge where wind and other stresses on trees increase [6,37]. Studies on windthrow following strip-cutting, of similar widths to the linear openings of this study, showed that tree mortality varied from 20 to 30% in the neighboring forests in the early years following disturbance [42,43]. The relatively permanent nature of natural stream openings may on the other hand reduce canopy disturbance as surrounding vegetation is adapted to the edge conditions [44,45,46]. Future studies should thus investigate the temporal dynamics of forest road establishment on surrounding forest structural characteristics. This would allow us to better understand how and if the effect stabilizes with time elapsed since road creation. Nonetheless, the greater abundance of openings (gap fraction) around anthropogenic openings led to an increase in sapling density. As these young stems grow in size they will reduce the openness of the surrounding forest.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Do Natural and Anthropogenic Linear Openings Cause the Same Effects?,4
975,"Orientation of the edge determines the amount of exposure to solar radiation and impact of wind, and hence may considerably modulate the impact [16]. North facing edges in south-eastern Pennsylvania exhibited milder microclimate effects, elevated irradiance in the forest understory in south-facing edges to distances of approximately 65 to 70 m [47]. However, in our study we only found a consistent effect of orientation in proximity to the anthropogenically created linear openings where most structural factors studied increased on the western side. The greater gap fraction may have led to increases in tree growth, and tree and sapling density.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. The Influence of Orientation,4
976,"In this study we identified effects of roads on forest structure to distances greater than reported in other boreal literature [46]. Given the positive influence of linear openings on tree height and density out to distances of 60 m on either side of the opening and given the vast network of forest roads, forest management is having an unintended influence on forest productivity. With edge effects of up to 120 m (60 m on both sides), more than 10 ha of forest are influenced per 1 km of road. With tens of thousands of kilometer’s of forest roads constructed annually [1] the changes in productivity of forest stands are easily on the order of hundreds of thousands of hectares per year. As well as increases in tree height and tree density there is also greater mortality as evidenced by the increase in gap fraction adjacent to roads. It will thus be critical in the future to fully evaluate the overall balance of the positive effects on growth and biomass with the increased mortality. However, our results on tree density show that there is a greater number of trees per unit area in the forests surrounding the linear openings than in the reference forests and these results include the presence of gap openings. The greater number of trees and their greater height thus imply that there should be a greater volume of wood in proximity to linear openings such as roads. This would be consistent with other findings that vegetation productivity increased up to 50 m into the forests adjacent to roads [11,12]. Thus despite their negative impacts on wildlife [37,48] and on indigenous culture [49] roads may have unintended positive effects on the growth and productivity of surrounding forests.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. How Far Do Effects Extend?,4
977,"The vast linear network of openings created due to road building and energy transport is having unplanned influences on surrounding forests. This study demonstrates that forest structure around linear openings is different than in undisturbed forest and that there are differences between natural linear openings such as streams and anthropogenically created ones such as roads and powerlines. Previously identified negative effects of roads on wildlife may at least in part be balanced by increased productivity from sapling recruitment to the tree layer. However, this increase in productivity may not compensate the permanent loss in tree volume, associated with tree removal for road and powerline construction. The construction of nonpermanent roads could in the long term have positive effects both on forest productivity and wildlife.This work adds to the existing evidence that LiDAR offers an effective and rapid means of capturing fine-scale heterogeneity as well as determining the cumulative impact of both anthropogenic and natural linear disturbances in the forests. This enlarges the scope for forest managers and conservation biologists by providing a deeper understanding of landscape fragmentation, spatial heterogeneity, and vegetation patterns across multiple-scales.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
978,"Large-scale assessments of natural resources provide important information for planning, management and conservation, and context for local or site-specific assessments. However, large-scale assessments are inherently difficult due to the large and complex data sets. The study in this article aims to estimate biomass and carbon in global-level mangrove forests to demonstrate an approach that integrates GIS-based geospatial analysis and high-performance parallel computing. Mangrove forests are important tropical wetland types growing within coastal marine environment [1,2]. They are recognized for having the highest carbon density among terrestrial ecosystems. Accordingly considerations about the distribution and extent of carbon associated with mangroves are highly relevant to terrestrial carbon cycling and the associated ecosystem services under global environmental or climate change [1,3]. However, as a result of land use and land cover change over the past several decades, large losses of mangroves at both the regional and global scales have been reported [2,4]. Biomass and carbon stocks related to mangroves can be a basis for averting degradation through payment for ecosystem service program (e.g., REDD+) and they are important to better understanding the global carbon cycle and the sustainability of mangrove ecosystems [3,5,6]. Along with increasing awareness in the importance of mangrove forests, many studies related to mangrove biomass and carbon stocks estimation have been conducted, typically through field survey [7,8,9]. However, the field survey approach is only suitable or feasible for site-specific or local-level studies. From the field survey results, the estimation of global mangrove biomass or carbon is typically based on a scaling approach (i.e., the multiplication of mean mangrove biomass density from fieldwork and the total area of mangrove forests). Further, Twilley et al. [10] developed a latitude-based model, extended from the scaling approach, for estimating mangrove biomass and carbon. Twilley et al.’s study gave 240,000 km2 of total mangrove area with 4.03 Pg C of carbon in mangrove biomass (2.34 Pg C from aboveground and 1.69 Pg C from belowground). Alongi [3] reported that the average carbon stock density at global level is 956 t C ha−1, which leads to 13 Pg C of ecosystem-level carbon stock for global mangrove forests given that the total area of global mangrove forests used in his study is 140,000 km2. Sanders et al. [11] estimated the total ecosystem-level carbon stock in global mangrove forests as 11.2 Pg C based on their fieldwork data in Australia, carbon stock data reported in the literature, and latitudinal information of mangroves from Giri et al. [12].An alternative is to estimate mangrove biomass and carbon using geospatial data collected through geospatial technologies such as remote sensing and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) [5,13]. The advancement of geospatial technologies has made geographically referenced data increasingly available at fine spatial resolutions for large spatial extents. These geospatial datasets in combination with field survey data provide support for the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon. Based on these data, models that establish the relationship between mangrove biomass and their drivers can be used to estimate mangrove biomass and carbon at global level. For example, Hutchison et al. [14] presented a climate model based on the temperature and precipitations of the regions where mangrove forests exist to estimate the global mangrove biomass. The climate model used by Hutchison et al. outperform the latitude-based model by Twilley et al. [10]. Hutchison et al.’s results show a total of 2.83 Pg of aboveground biomass (1.11 Pg for below-ground biomass) in global mangrove forests. The mangrove extent data from Spalding et al. [15], which gave a total mangrove area of 153,140.94 km2, was used in the study by Hutchison et al. Besides climate-based model, allometric models can be employed to estimate mangrove biomass and carbon from allometric variables represented by canopy heights (see [7,16]). This is attributed to the fact that the information of canopy heights can be derived from geospatial data that are remotely sensed, for example, from satellite-borne sensors. Fatoyinbo and Simard [5] applied an allometric model to estimate mangrove biomass from canopy heights in Africa. The information of mangrove canopy heights is extracted from the GIS-based overlay analysis between Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data and mangrove extent data classified from Landsat imagery.The geospatial data and allometric models based on canopy height offer a means of estimating mangrove biomass and carbon in a convenient manner. However, it poses a grand challenge for the global-level mangrove biomass estimation because massive geospatial data are involved together with considerable computational demand. For example, the global SRTM data used for extracting canopy height information is now available at a spatial resolution of 30 m by 30 m (originally 90 m by 90 m before 2015). This corresponds to hundreds of gigabytes of storage needs just for the primary dataset. Even higher storage and computing capacities are required to process and analyze these datasets for the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon at the global level. In other words, the use of these fine-resolution geospatial data for the global-level mangrove biomass and carbon estimation represents a big data-driven challenge (see [17,18,19]).Therefore, to address this big data-driven challenge, the objective of this study is to conduct an estimation of global mangrove biomass and carbon by using a GIS-based spatial analysis approach integrated with parallel computing. The estimation is based on fine-resolution geospatial data available at global level. Please note that the fine resolution here is relative to the global scale. Geospatial data used in this study is based on a 30 m × 30 m spatial resolution, which is often referred to as medium spatial resolution (in a range of 10–100 m) in the literature of remote sensing [20]. We develop this spatially integrated approach to enable and accelerate the global-level estimation on high-performance computing. This spatially integrated approach is well-suited to geospatial data with even finer spatial resolutions.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
979,"The global-level estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon is based on two datasets: global digital elevation model (DEM) data and global mangrove extent data (Figure 1, Table 1). The DEM includes two models: Digital Surface Model (DSM) and Digital Terrain Model (DTM). DSM includes the elevation information of all entities on the ground, such as buildings or forests, and DTM only represents the bare ground surface without any entities. SRTM data is a worldwide DSM with a 30 m by 30 m spatial resolution (previously available at 90- and 1000-m spatial resolutions) created for the year of 2000. The SRTM dataset (https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/) was originally generated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and released by US Geological Survey (USGS) in 2014. It includes 14,276 GeoTIFF tiles that contain the elevation information from 60° north latitude to 56° south latitude. The size of each SRTM tile is 3600 × 3600 pixels. The size of the entire SRTM dataset is about 315 GB. Global mangrove coverage dataset was created by USGS in 2000 (see [12] and http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/4). It is a vector-based GIS dataset that has 1.4 million polygons representing the extent of mangroves. This mangrove extent dataset was generated from the classification of Global Land Survey (GLS) data and the Landsat Imagery. It was originally created as raster-based spatial dataset at a 30-m spatial resolution. From this dataset, there are approximately 137,760 km2 global mangrove extent in 117 countries and regions in the year of 2000 (see [12]).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Data,2
980,"The framework for the spatially explicit approach that integrates GIS-based geospatial analysis and high-performance parallel computing for the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon consists of the following major steps: (1) selection of SRTM tiles, (2) extraction of mangrove canopy height, (3) calculation of mangrove area, (4) the estimation of biomass and carbon in mangrove forest, and (5) parallel computing that accelerates the spatially explicit estimation (Figure 2). 2.2.1. Selection of SRTM TilesThe global SRTM dataset includes 14,276 tiles that cover the area from 60° north to 56° south latitude. As a first step, we exclude those SRTM tiles that do not contain mangroves to facilitate the entire analysis. Considering the amount of SRTM datasets, we used grid-based spatial indexing (see [21]) in which the bounding box of each SRTM tile was used as a spatial index grid. The necessity of using spatial indexing for addressing big spatial data challenges has been well acknowledged in the literature (see [22,23]). The grid-based spatial indexing relies on the use of a lattice of non-overlapping and fixed-size rectangles to index the spatial dimension of a study region (see [24]). Each entity (e.g., point, polylines, or polygons) of the original spatial data of interest is associated with an indexing rectangle (sometimes multiple). This indexing mechanism can efficiently support the spatial query or selection operations if the geospatial datasets of interest are complicated or large in size. The spatial index grid used in this study corresponds to the lattice of bounding boxes of SRTM tiles. Those spatial indexing rectangles that do not contain or intersect with mangrove extent polygons can be identified and excluded. Thus, by using this spatial indexing mechanism, we can efficiently select those SRTM tiles within or intersected with polygons of mangrove extent instead of using the original datasets. This grid-based spatial indexing also supports the subsequent analysis steps. As a result, a total of 1512 SRTM tiles that cover the extent of mangrove forests are identified.  2.2.2. Extraction of Mangrove Canopy HeightGiven the SRTM tiles and mangrove extent data, we extract the canopy heights of mangroves by using GIS-based overlay analysis. Global SRTM data are raster-based and mangrove extent are vector-based. Thus, we extracted from SRTM tiles those raster cells that are located within the polygons of mangrove extent. It is assumed that the ground elevation that mangroves grow is zero (see [5]). In other words, if the value of a SRTM raster cell within mangrove polygons is positive, the value represents the canopy height of the mangroves in this raster cell. Therefore, we extract the canopy heights of mangroves from the overlay analysis between SRTM tiles and mangrove extent data (using clip function for raster data in ArcGIS (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA)). Figure 3 shows the distribution of mangrove area in terms of canopy heights.It is suggested in the literature (see [5]) that high values of the canopy height cells may be associated with high uncertainties in SRTM data for the derivation of canopy heights. As a result, those mangrove cells with very high canopy heights (often in islands) need to be removed as Fatoyinbo and Simard [5] suggested (a threshold of 40 m was used in their study in Africa). For example, Figure 4 shows the spatial pattern of canopy heights of mangroves in a region in Bali Island, Indonesia. For the region classified as mangroves from Giri et al.’s dataset, canopy heights can be up to 1190 m. While this indicates the commission error (false alarm) in the remote sensing classification, those cells with very high canopy heights should not be considered in the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon [5]. This suggests that a cut-off threshold needs to be applied. The tallest mangroves up to 64 m (individual height) were reported in Cayapas-Mataje reserve, Ecuador (see [15,25]). From the SRTM data, the maximum of mangrove canopy heights (averaged height instead of individual height) in this Reserve is 48 m. Thus, in this study, we used 48 m as the cut-off threshold to derive the canopy heights of mangroves for biomass estimation. Those mangrove cells with canopy heights higher than 48 m are filtered. 2.2.3. Calculation of Mangrove AreaBased on derived canopy heights of mangroves, we calculate the area of mangroves. A straightforward approach for area calculation is to count the number of raster cells and then multiply this number with the size of a raster cell (30 m by 30 m here). This approach is based on planar geometry and it may work for the case in which the number of raster cells is small. However, this study is targeted on the global level and the ellipsoid shape of the Earth will lead to the introduction of errors if we use the approach based on the planar geometry. Thus, we opted to use an alternative approach based on geodesic geometry (see [26]) to calculate the area of mangroves from raster cells. In other words, we calculate the geodesic area of raster cells of mangroves instead of planar area considering the scale of interest is large and the number of raster cells involved is extremely large. The way that we calculated geodesic area is to first convert raster cells of mangrove canopy height into polygons with geodesic coordinates, and then calculate the geodesic area of the polygons of mangrove canopy height. The use of this geodesic area approach is very important since it allows for the accurate calculation of area when the study extent of interest is large (this study here). As a result of this analysis step, we obtain a set of mangrove polygons that are vectorized from raster-based mangrove canopy height data. Each mangrove polygon is associated with a specific canopy height value and geodesic area. 2.2.4. The Estimation of Biomass and Carbon in Mangrove ForestGiven the set of mangrove polygons with the information of canopy heights and area, next step is to derive the mangrove biomass and carbon. We used the global allometric model (see [5,7] and Equation (1)) to conduct the estimation of aboveground biomass. Equations (2) and (3) show the derivation of belowground biomass (mangrove root biomass) and carbon stock in this study.


b1i = (10.8 × hi + 34.9) × ai


(1)



b2i = 0.38 × b1i


(2)



ci = 0.5 × (b1i + b2i)


(3)


where b1i is the aboveground biomass (unit: Mg) associated with a mangrove polygon i. and hi is the mangrove canopy height of the mangrove polygon. ai is the area (unit: ha) of the mangrove polygon i. b2i and ci are the belowground biomass (unit: Mg) and the total carbon (unit: Mg C) of the corresponding mangrove polygon. The coefficients used in Equations (1)–(3) are based on the literature (see [5,9,27]). The first part (i.e., 10.8 × hi + 34.9) in Equation (1) is the global allometric model of canopy heights (unit: Mg ha−1). Once we obtain the above- and below-ground biomass and carbon of each mangrove polygon, we derive the total biomass and carbon at the global level or by regions via summation operations. 2.2.5. Parallel Computing for Accelerated Geospatial Analysis of Mangrove DataThe estimation of biomass and carbon stock in mangrove forest at global level poses a big data challenge because the size of the datasets is massive and the computing demand for this estimation is huge. Desktop computing environments cannot cope with massive dataset and associated computing demand because of the physical limits on computing hardware configuration (e.g., memory, and computing power from CPUs). To overcome this big data challenge, we chose to use a parallel computing approach that allows for leveraging high-performance computing resources for acceleration. As advancement in cyberinfrastructure [28,29], high-performance computing resources such as computing clusters (with hundreds or thousands of CPUs or higher) are increasingly available. Parallel computing approaches allow for the partitioning of a large spatial analysis task that is challenging or infeasible for single CPUs into a set of smaller sub-tasks [18,30,31]. These smaller tasks, which are computationally efficient or feasible, can be deployed to the high-performance computing clusters and executed concurrently by the collection of multiple computing elements (CPUs) on these clusters. As a result, the entire spatial analysis task can be computationally affordable and accelerated via the divide-and-conquer mechanism built in parallel computing algorithms [30]. The parallel computing approach that we used in this study is based on spatial domain decomposition strategy (see [32]). The SRTM dataset that we selected from the original one has 1512 tiles. Each SRTM tile is further split into a set of sub-tiles, for example, using 1D (row-wise or column-wise) or 2D decomposition (see Figure 5 for illustration). The entire analysis steps for the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon (from the extraction of mangrove canopy heights and area to the derivation of biomass and carbon) are applied to these sub-tiles each corresponding to a task. For example, if each tile is partitioned into 10 sub-tiles along row-wise direction (1D decomposition), the number of sub-tiles that we are dealing with is 15,120. That is, the number of computing tasks that we have for this example is 15,120. These analysis tasks are then scheduled by the head node of a computing cluster and assigned to computing nodes for parallel acceleration. Once these analysis tasks are completed, associated results (e.g., mangrove area, biomass, and carbon) are then aggregated to the levels of interest (e.g., global or country-level).The computing cluster that we used is a Windows-based cluster with 30 computing nodes each having four CPUs (i.e., in total 120 CPUs are available for parallel acceleration; CPU clock rate: 3.4 GHz). These computing nodes are connected through a gigabit network switch. The operating system on each computing node is Windows Server 2012 R2. The job scheduling software for parallel computing is Microsoft HPC Pack 2012 R2 (version 4.2). We used geodatabase technologies to organize the geospatial data used in this study (SRTM data, mangrove extent, and country boundaries). ESRI ArcGIS (version 10.4) was used to support the spatial analyses in this study. Further, we used Python scripts to automate the processing and analysis of geospatial data. ", 2.

The coefficients used in Equations (1)–(3) are based on the literature (see [5,9,27]). The first part (i.e., 10.8 × hi + 34.9) in Equation (1) is the global allometric model of canopy heights (unit: Mg ha−1). Once we obtain the above- and below-ground biomass and carbon of each mangrove polygon, we derive the total biomass and carbon at the global level or by regions via summation operations.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2.4. The Estimation of Biomass and Carbon in Mangrove Forest,2
985,"The estimation of biomass and carbon stock in mangrove forest at global level poses a big data challenge because the size of the datasets is massive and the computing demand for this estimation is huge. Desktop computing environments cannot cope with massive dataset and associated computing demand because of the physical limits on computing hardware configuration (e.g., memory, and computing power from CPUs). To overcome this big data challenge, we chose to use a parallel computing approach that allows for leveraging high-performance computing resources for acceleration. As advancement in cyberinfrastructure [28,29], high-performance computing resources such as computing clusters (with hundreds or thousands of CPUs or higher) are increasingly available. Parallel computing approaches allow for the partitioning of a large spatial analysis task that is challenging or infeasible for single CPUs into a set of smaller sub-tasks [18,30,31]. These smaller tasks, which are computationally efficient or feasible, can be deployed to the high-performance computing clusters and executed concurrently by the collection of multiple computing elements (CPUs) on these clusters. As a result, the entire spatial analysis task can be computationally affordable and accelerated via the divide-and-conquer mechanism built in parallel computing algorithms [30]. The parallel computing approach that we used in this study is based on spatial domain decomposition strategy (see [32]). The SRTM dataset that we selected from the original one has 1512 tiles. Each SRTM tile is further split into a set of sub-tiles, for example, using 1D (row-wise or column-wise) or 2D decomposition (see Figure 5 for illustration). The entire analysis steps for the estimation of mangrove biomass and carbon (from the extraction of mangrove canopy heights and area to the derivation of biomass and carbon) are applied to these sub-tiles each corresponding to a task. For example, if each tile is partitioned into 10 sub-tiles along row-wise direction (1D decomposition), the number of sub-tiles that we are dealing with is 15,120. That is, the number of computing tasks that we have for this example is 15,120. These analysis tasks are then scheduled by the head node of a computing cluster and assigned to computing nodes for parallel acceleration. Once these analysis tasks are completed, associated results (e.g., mangrove area, biomass, and carbon) are then aggregated to the levels of interest (e.g., global or country-level).The computing cluster that we used is a Windows-based cluster with 30 computing nodes each having four CPUs (i.e., in total 120 CPUs are available for parallel acceleration; CPU clock rate: 3.4 GHz). These computing nodes are connected through a gigabit network switch. The operating system on each computing node is Windows Server 2012 R2. The job scheduling software for parallel computing is Microsoft HPC Pack 2012 R2 (version 4.2). We used geodatabase technologies to organize the geospatial data used in this study (SRTM data, mangrove extent, and country boundaries). ESRI ArcGIS (version 10.4) was used to support the spatial analyses in this study. Further, we used Python scripts to automate the processing and analysis of geospatial data. ", 2.

986,"In this study, we used 1D row-wise spatial domain decomposition to split each SRTM tile into 10 smaller sub-tiles. That is, the total number of sub-tiles after spatial domain decomposition is 15,120. After excluding those sub-tiles without mangroves, we obtained 7604 sub-tiles that need to be analyzed for biomass and carbon estimation. These 7604 sub-tiles are then wrapped as tasks that are submitted to the Windows-based computing cluster for parallel acceleration. Sequential run based on a single CPU for analyzing all of these sub-tiles would require 57.6 h (307,386 s). However, only 1.46 h (5247 s) are needed to complete all the analysis when 120 CPUs are used for parallel computing. A metric of speedup, which is the ratio of sequential computing time over parallel computing time (see [30]), can be used to evaluate the acceleration performance of parallel algorithms. The 1.46 h of parallel computing time corresponds to a speed up of 39.52, which means the parallel computing approach using 120 CPUs can accelerate 39.52 times compared to the sequential computing approach.", 3.

987,"The total area of global-level mangroves is estimated as 130,420 km2 (see Table 2). The aboveground and belowground biomass in global mangrove forests are 1.908 Pg and 0.725 Pg. The total carbon stock in above- and below-ground biomass is 1.32 Pg C. The average aboveground biomass density is 146.3 Mg ha−1. Table 3 reports the mangrove area, biomass, and carbon for some representative countries. Figure 6 is a map of the estimated mangrove aboveground biomass density at country level. Figure 7 illustrates the spatially explicit pattern of mangrove aboveground biomass density for four example regions. Figure 8 depicts the relationship of aboveground biomass density of mangroves estimated from this study with latitude. The aboveground biomass density is summarized from our estimation results for each latitude (within 1 degree of band—i.e., 0–1°, 1–2°, …, and 39–40°).

988,"The estimation of mangrove metrics from the global-level geospatial datasets (including elevation and mangrove extent) is both data- and computation-intensive. The volume of original geospatial datasets in this study are hundreds of gigabytes. However, the spatial analyses algorithms (e.g., overlay analysis, vectorization) generate more intermediate data and require even more computing support. The parallel computing approach allows for dividing the entire spatial analysis task (including data and computation) that requires over 2 days of serial computing into a collection of smaller tasks that can be computed in parallel. The parallel computing time was reduced to 1.46 h when 120 CPUs are recruited to work together to conduct the spatially explicit estimation of mangrove metrics. The hourly-level parallel computing time instead of days for the sequential counterpart brings more flexibility and convenience for verifying, testing, and (re)using the GIS-based spatial analysis for the estimation of global-level mangrove biomass and carbon. The estimated total area of global mangroves (130,420 km2) is lower than those reported in the literature (see Table 2). While the mangrove extent data used in this study is from Giri et al. [12], raster cells within a mangrove polygon are excluded in this study if the elevation of these cells is zero or higher than the cut-off threshold (48 m here). Mangrove area (140,000 km2) reported by Alongi [3] is approximated from Giri et al.’s work. The estimated mangrove area at the global level is different with that (153,141 km2) reported by Hutchison et al. [14], who used the mangrove extent data (covering from the year of 1999 to 2003) by Spalding et al. [15] (compiled from the classification of remote sensing imagery and partially from Spalding et al.’s previous work). The estimated total mangrove aboveground biomass is 1.908 Pg at the global level, which is consistent with those reported in the literature (2.34 Pg from Twilley et al. [10] and 2.83 Pg from Hutchison et al. [14]). While these biomass values are consistent, the ways that these values were estimated are different. Twilley et al.’s estimation is based on the summation of aboveground biomass calculated from the multiplication of mean biomass density with mangrove area along 10° latitude. Hutchison et al. [14] derived the aboveground biomass by combining mean biomass estimated from their climate model (based on temperature and precipitation) and mangrove area from Spalding et al. [15]. We estimated global aboveground biomass by using an allometric model of mangrove canopy height and mangrove extent from Giri et al. [12]. The averaged aboveground biomass density in mangrove forests that we estimated is 146.3 Mg ha−1 at the global level. Compared with the literature, Hutchison et al. [14] reported 184.8 Mg ha−1 with a 95% confidence range from 142.1–222.0 Mg ha−1. The average aboveground biomass in global mangroves reported by Twilley et al. [10] is 178.2 Mg ha−1 with a standard deviation of 112.2 Mg ha−1. Our estimated result, while lower than those reported in the literature, falls well within the range of previously reported results. Further, our analysis gave an estimation of 1.32 Pg C for carbon stock in the above- and below-ground biomass of global mangrove forests. This carbon stock estimation is lower than those reported in the literature (1.82 Pg C reported by Alongi [3], and 1.568 Pg C from Sanders et al. [11]). The mangrove extent information used in these three studies (including our study) is from the same work by Giri et al. [12]. Assuming 86% of soil carbon in the ecosystem-level carbon (see Sanders et al. [11]), we obtain 9.4 Pg C of ecosystem-level carbon in global mangrove forest, lower than 13 Pg C by Alongi and 11.2 Pg C by Sanders et al.; see [3,11]). The global allometric model of canopy height used in this study allows for the derivation of aboveground biomass density for each 30 m × 30 m raster cell of mangroves. The aboveground biomass density of mangroves for different regions or countries can be further summarized from these raster cells. From our analysis, the country with the highest aboveground biomass density of mangrove in top 20 countries worldwide in terms of mangrove area is Papua New Guinea (217.29 Mg ha−1), seconded by Venezuela (199.91 Mg ha−1). Indonesia ranks the third with 193.39 Mg ha−1. High aboveground biomass densities tend to concentrate in countries in Latin America and Southeast Asia (from a range of 98–217 Mg ha−1) (see Figure 5). Appendix A reports a comparison of our results for countries in Africa with those by Fatoyinbo and Simard [5]. The total mangrove area in Africa estimated using our approach (based on mangrove extent data from Giri et al. [12]) is 25,640.71 km2, which is slightly lower than that from Fatoyinbo and Simard’s study (25,960 km2). However, the total aboveground biomass estimated from this study is a little higher than that from Fatoyinbo and Simard. Correspondingly, the mean biomass density of mangrove in Africa that we estimated is 122.37 Mg/ha, a bit higher than that by Fatoyinbo and Simard. The difference between our results and those by Fatoyinbo and Simard [5] (including continental and country scales) lies in the use of different mangrove extent and SRTM data with alternative spatial resolutions (30 m for our study and 90 m for their study). Our mangrove extent data were classified (combination of both supervised and unsupervised classification) from Landsat remote sensing imagery by Giri et al. [12]; Fatoyinbo and Simard [5] applied a different classification algorithm (unsupervised classification) to extract mangrove extent in their study.As a comparison with field measurements, we used in Zambezi River Delta, where a field inventory was conducted in 2013 (see [8,33]). Our estimated mean biomass density (for canopy height from 2–29 m) in this study region is 126.84 Mg/ha, which is slightly lower than that (140.81 Mg/C) derived from the results in the 2013 field inventory (fiver height classes covering 2–29 m [8]; see [34] for the detailed field data and relevant reports). This difference can be attributed to the use of alternative allometric models (an allometric model of diameter at breast height was used in Stringer et al. [8]), in addition to resolution of the source data. Despite the inherent difference between the remote sensing and field inventory assessments, our result of mean biomass density is in good agreement with that from the 2013 field inventory. Our accelerated spatial analysis results also provide insights into the relationship between biomass density and latitude (i.e., the latitude model). Equations (7)–(9) are latitude models reported by Twilley et al. [10], Saenger and Snedaker [7], and Hutchison et al. [14]. The corresponding goodness of fit (R2) of these models are 0.5625, 0.48 and 0.139. Notations are the same as in Equations (4)–(6).

Figure 9 depicts the plots of the latitude models generated from this study and existing studies in the literature. It can be seen from Figure 9a that aboveground biomass density in southern hemisphere are higher than that in northern hemisphere. But this difference becomes lower as increase in latitude. As we could see from Figure 9b, the aboveground biomass density from the global-level latitude model in this study (see Equation (4)) is lower in low latitudes (0–10°) than the other three models reported in the literature. This difference tends to be smaller as latitudes become higher (10–20°). For the latitude between 20–30°, this difference reaches the minimum. Once latitude higher than 30°, aboveground biomass density tends to be higher than other models (by Twilley et al. and Saenger and Snedaker; see [7,10]) or exhibit marginal difference (by Hutchison et al. [14]). Our estimation of aboveground biomass relies on mangrove canopy height data by applying the empirical model from Saenger and Snedaker [7], which is based on a regression approach of fieldwork results reported in the literature in terms of the relationship between biomass and canopy height. However, the range of canopy heights in the geospatial data derived from SRTM data and mangrove extent is different with that reported in the literature. For example, for low latitude regions (0–2°), the range of canopy heights varies from 1 to 48 m (the cut-off threshold) in the geospatial data used in this study. Yet, the corresponding canopy heights reported in the literature and used by the allometric model is from 15–26.4 m (see [7]). This leads to the fact that the mean canopy height from the geospatial data within 0–2° (12.62 m) is lower than that from the empirical allometric model. As a result, the mean biomass density for low latitude region estimated from this study tends to be lower than those reported in the literature.Canopy height-based allometric model combined with remotely sensed data is well-suited to estimating biomass in mangrove forest. Of course, this approach for biomass estimation particularly at a large spatial scale is not limited to mangrove forests; it can be generalized for other types of forest if the allometric relationship between biomass and canopy heights is established. For example, Lefsky et al. [35] investigated the functional relationship between biomass and canopy heights in three forests (coniferous and deciduous) in tropical and temperate regions (one in Brazil and two in USA). Lefsky et al. stressed that canopy height is a reasonable indicator for biomass estimation from remote sensing data. Further, Zhang et al. [36] presented a remote sensing approach that combines metrics such as leaf area index and canopy heights to study forest biomass in California, USA. Zhang et al. [36] reported that forest biomass is strongly related to canopy heights for forests in the entire state of California. Thus, once the height-to-biomass relationship is available (e.g., estimated through fieldwork), it is feasible to apply the geospatial analysis approach in our study to other types of forests.", 4. Discussion,None,4
989,"In this study, the GIS-based spatial analysis combined with high-performance and parallel computing provides unique support that enables the estimation of biomass and carbon in mangrove ecosystems at the global level. This global-level estimation is based on the processing and analysis of high-resolution geospatial data including global DEM and mangrove extent, which represents a big data challenge. The parallel computing approach developed in this study allows for the decomposition of large datasets and associated computation into smaller ones that are accelerated using high-performance computing resources. In other words, this global-level estimation is a data-intensive computing problem (see [37]) for which high-performance and parallel computing is an idealistic solution.Our estimation of mangrove-related metrics (including area, biomass, and carbon) at the global level is different, but in general consistent, with those reported in the literature. The following aspects account for this difference: (1) datasets used in the estimation are different in terms of sources, spatial resolutions, or data acquisition time, and (2) processing or analysis methods (e.g., remote sensing imagery classification, or models of biomass) are different in terms of algorithms, parameters, or variables. Our estimation is based on the mangrove canopy height information and allometric model of canopy heights, and this estimation provide an alternative approach for the quantitative study of global-level mangrove ecosystems from a data-intensive perspective.The big data-driven geospatial analytics of mangrove biomass and associated carbon in this study provide efficacious support for better understanding spatial heterogeneity in the mangrove forests at the global level. As the high-performance and parallel computing approach tackles the data- and compute-intensive challenges associated with this global-level estimation, the mangrove-related metrics derived from this study can be used to further the investigation of complex spatial dynamics in global mangrove ecosystems. This can be of great help in terms of informing policies for achieving long-term preservation and sustainability of these both ecologically and economically important wetland ecosystems. Our future work includes (1) application of allometric models of canopy height specific to countries or regions; (2) accuracy assessment of the analysis results including mangrove area and biophysical properties such as height, biomass, and carbon; (3) further evaluation of parallel acceleration performance; and (4) introduction of spatial statistics approaches (e.g., spatial autocorrelation) to investigate the spatially explicit characteristics of mangrove metrics.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
990,"Forests face multiple abiotic and biotic disturbance events due to climate change. Many forests face new disturbance regimes (e.g., fire, drought, flooding, frost frequency). They also may face invasion by non-native species or encroachment of native species that are more adapted to frequent disturbance. Low-lying coastal forests are most vulnerable to the gradual rise in sea level and storm-related disturbance. If forested communities are unable to adapt quickly enough, the imposed disturbances could lead to a state change. Disturbance is considered a driver of change in community structure in many ecosystems, such as maritime forests [1,2,3,4]. Occurring within a few miles of the coastline and found worldwide, maritime forests often establish behind large dunes, which limit disturbance through the interception of salt spray and preventive flooding of freshwater communities [5]. However, after coastal regions sustain multiple abiotic and biotic disruptions, including coastal storms, saltwater intrusion, flooding from sea-level rise (SLR), and encroachment from more salt-tolerant species [6,7,8,9], maritime forests become more vulnerable to these multiple factors.The capacity of maritime forests to experience resilience, the recovery of communities or ecosystems to their structure and function after a disturbance [10], may be due to the intensity, frequency and duration of events [11,12]. Community recovery may transition to a community that is functionally similar, but differ in species abundance from the previous community. Communities or ecosystems that exhibit resistance to disturbance are unchanged (e.g., in mortality and growth) [13]. Although there may be shifting in species abundance within a community or ecosystem, the system will be relatively unchanged following a disturbance.For communities that lack resilience to disturbance, a tipping point may be reached which reduces community capacity to recover, potentially leading to forest disassembly and ecosystem collapse [14,15]. Relative sea-level rise (RSLR) rates and storm frequency/intensity are immediate threats to maritime forests but differ in rates and impact along coastlines [16,17,18]. Disturbances from coastal storms have increased over the last half-century [19]. When long-lived trees succumb to disturbances, the magnitude of disturbance and potential recovery may differ based on many factors including RSLR rates, landscape position sensu of Young et al. [5] and storm frequency/intensity [17,18]. The future trajectory of maritime forests may differ in species diversity and composition [20] as successive storms cause plant communities to reassemble in a new way.Many forest species exhibit some level of salt tolerance, but due to their protected position on the landscape, may have salt-sensitive species that experience large-scale dieback with saltwater intrusion [6,9,21]. Differences in how woody species respond to salt intrusion can affect distribution patterns within coastal communities [22]. In addition to salinity stress, coastal storms have strong winds that can cause extensive damage to maritime forests [23,24]. As recovery may be delayed due to multiple environmental stressors, it can take many years to fully assess the impact of storms in forested communities [25,26]. Storms impact long-term coastal community composition through multiple mechanisms: decreasing shade-intolerant species [27], decreasing wind-intolerant species [28] or through replacing salt-sensitive species with more salt-tolerant shrubs and herbs [29]. Large infrequent disturbance events can have catastrophic effects on community composition [30]. Equally crucial to plant spatial distributions is the gradual threat of salt intrusion through relative sea-level rise (RSLR).Plant successional patterns based on vulnerability to salt tolerance may be disrupted as species adapt or disappear to flooding [7]. It is hard to model how coastal plant communities will respond to RSLR due to many coastal processes that differ among coastal communities (e.g., elevation, species salt tolerance, land subsidence). There also may be a sharp distinction between barrier island and mainland coastal forests due to geographic position relative to disturbance. Barrier islands are the first line of defense for mainland communities during storms, buffer coasts and inland areas from the full force of wind, storm surge and wave energy [31,32], which can shift sand and change shorelines through erosion. With increased storms and RSLR, islands may be more vulnerable than the mainland as erosion occurs on all sides of the island, leading to reduced upland area [33].Vegetative composition and topography affect coastline response to disturbance. Maritime forests enhance physical resistance to storms, providing short-term stability [34], but may increase long-term erosion in areas with high RSLR by limiting movement of sediment [33]. Maritime forests disassemble when they succumb to saltwater inputs from RSLR and storms, and can be replaced by low-lying marsh species that have the potential to migrate to adjacent uplands [35]. Available recruitment space allows marsh species to expand because recruitment of maritime forest species can be impaired by saline conditions (>2–5 ppt), hampering maritime forest reassembly [36]. Forest disassembly (e.g., loss of biodiversity; decrease in species abundance) and shifts in community composition due to RSLR have the potential to alter island response to disturbance and the potential to change coastlines.Virginia barrier islands have experienced dramatic changes in sediment accretion and erosion over the last few decades; however, erosion has exceeded accretion on these islands. Overall island area has decreased for the Virginia barrier island system [37] with shrub expansion dominating the landscape and changing the recruitment environment [36]. This change in recruitment may alter resilience of forested ecosystems by interfering with establishment of shade-intolerant tree species. Decreased recruitment of tree species on barrier islands could limit their capacity to provide protection for mainland communities. Additionally, land subsidence caused by isostatic adjustments post-glaciation, groundwater withdrawals, and increased global sea-level rise has resulted in the southern Chesapeake Bay region having the highest rate of sea-level rise and sediment erosion on the Atlantic Coast [38].Forest decline is well documented along the mid-Atlantic coast, typically converting to marsh with RSLR [8], but similar effects in maritime forest protected by tall dunes are less studied. It is essential to determine the role of geographic location on the resilience of maritime forests due to climate drivers and to project future community composition during a time of increased RSLR and storm frequency and intensity [39]. The relative extent to which forests on the mainland and barrier islands can be resilient to change after long-term disturbance is unclear. The immediate effect of storm damage on forests is well understood [25]; what is less well recognized is the long-term structural and compositional changes in forests due to combined effects of storms and sea-level rise [40]. Mortality can be delayed, so long-term monitoring of these ecosystems can provide insight into species compositional changes and future community trajectory after a storm event. Here, we fill a knowledge gap by quantifying maritime forest compositional change over a decade using data on the Virginia, USA, mainland (Savage Neck Natural Area Preserve) and a nearby barrier island (Parramore Island). We hypothesize that due to position on the landscape, forest disassembly will be higher on barrier islands than mainland as seen in reduction in tree basal area and species richness.", 1.

991,"Savage Neck Dunes Natural Area Preserve (37.3279° N, 75.0042° W) is located on the southwest portion of the Eastern Shore of Virginia (Figure 1). The site owned and managed by the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation’s Natural Heritage Division serves as an important stopover site for migratory birds. The preserve contains 86 ha of maritime forest, 16 of which was first surveyed in summer 2003 [41]. The maritime forest is located behind a large dune (Supplementary Figure S1). Savage Neck Dunes was hit by Hurricane Isabel (2003) after the initial survey, notably the most destructive hurricane to impact Virginia in recent history [42]. Prior to Hurricane Isabel (2003), the Eastern Shore of Virginia had been hit by multiple infrequent storms. The dominant canopy species in 2003 prior to the storm were Liquidambar styraciflua, Acer rubrum L., and Pinus taeda.Parramore Island (37.5387° N, 75.6280° W) is one of fourteen islands in the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research site, located midway along the Eastern Shore of the Delmarva Peninsula (Figure 1). It is among the largest uninhabited barrier islands in the USA and is managed by The Nature Conservancy. Rapid erosion of sediment on Parramore Island since 1980 may have contributed to vegetation changes such as species loss [43,44]. Uprooted Pinus taeda and Prunus serotina accumulate on the oceanside beach of Parramore Island following erosion [43], creating ghost forests (i.e., snags that were created due to salt intrusion), although intact maritime forest occurs behind well-established interior dunes (Supplementary Figure S1). The dominant canopy species in 1996 prior to Hurricane Isabel in 2003 were Persea palustris, Juniperus virginiana, and Morella cerifera.These two locations also differ in how they obtain freshwater. Barrier islands such as Parramore Island are unique in that they typically have a freshwater lens, which contains fresh groundwater from rainfall. The freshwater lens sits on top of seawater. As the sea level rises, the freshwater lens is brought closer to the surface. Shrubs also can influence freshwater groundwater through bringing the lens closer to the surface relative to grassland plant communities (Wood and Zinnert, unpublished). Mainland coastlines have additional sources of freshwater (e.g., rivers) but freshwater sources, similar to barrier islands, are becoming more saline as sea level rises [45].", 2.

In each quadrat, we measured the distance from the center to the nearest woody species that was >3 cm diameter at 1.3 m DBH (diameter at breast height) and recorded the species.

Shannon–Weiner diversity indices were not significantly different for the two time periods (2003 = 1.9, 2018 = 1.7; t = 0.00005, p = 0.99). The top three canopy species in 2003 based on importance values were Liquidambar styraciflua L. (78%), Acer rubrum L. (70%), and Pinus taeda (70%) (Supplementary Table S1, Figure 3). In 2018, the top three dominants remained the same, although the ranking among the three species changed, A. rubrum (87%), P. taeda (84%), and L. styraciflua (60%). All three species increased in relative abundance and relative frequency from 2003 to 2018 (Supplementary Table S1). There were no shrubs present in the canopy. This community appeared resilient to disturbance during the 15-year timespan based on growth and species richness. The total number of individuals recorded in 2018 was 86% of those recorded in 2003. Three species identified in 2018 were not found in 2003, Robinia pseudoacacia, Celtis occidentalis, and Quercus stellata. Three species were lost in the interim, Carya tomentosa, Cercis canadensis, and Cornus florida, all low in 2003 abundance.During the study timeframe, Parramore Island upland was reduced in size by 9% (from 1199 ha to 1092 ha [33]). Of permanent forested plots surveyed in 1997, 33% converted to grassland and 33% were lost to erosion and now occur as ghost forest on the shore or lost to the ocean (Figure 4). Substantial change in community composition was observed in the remaining forested plots but Shannon–Wiener diversity did not change (1996 = 0.99, 2018 = 0.97; t = 0.44, p = 0.66). The forest once dominated by evergreen trees (i.e., Persea palustris and J. virginiana; Supplementary Table S2) was converted to dominance primarily by Morella cerifera, although Persea palustris and Pinus taeda remained in the top three species based on importance value (Supplementary Table S2; Figure 3). Juniperus virginiana was lost as a dominant species with only 2 individuals recorded in 2018. Total number of individuals recorded in 2018 was 46% of those in 1997.

Acer rubrum increased in basal area by 32% and P. taeda increased by 31% (Supplementary Table S1). Although L. styraciflua individuals were reduced in number by 52%, the trees that remained increased in basal area (Supplementary Table S1, Figure 5). Understory sub-shrub Ilex opaca experienced the greatest gain in basal area (65%), primarily due to a greater number of individuals (Supplementary Table S1).Conversely, on Parramore Island, basal area was drastically reduced to 16% of 1997 values, with the majority of 2018 basal area comprised of the shrub, Morella cerifera (Supplementary Table S2).

Pinus taeda increased to larger-size classes while Persea palustris and M. cerifera shifted to higher frequency in lower-size classes (Figure 5).

1002,"The extent to which forested communities of similar species are resilient or disassembled may depend on the intensity and frequency of the disturbance. Coastal communities are threatened by multiple disturbances, largely episodic storms and chronic RSLR. Storms can temporarily alter sea level and often result in saltwater intrusion that can result in forest species loss [29,54]. Our study documents resistance and resilience to disturbance (i.e., storms and RSLR) along the protected mainland maritime forest community of Savage Neck Dunes. Resistance is seen in the three dominant species, Liquidambar styraciflua, Pinus taeda, and Acer rubrum remaining the same and increased basal area during a time with multiple storm events. Geographic position increases likelihood of protection from the full force of storms through position on the bayside and large intact dunes. Resilience is seen in that the community was able to recover after Hurricane Isabel and several tropical storms, thereafter. It typically takes a decade or more for communities to recover after a storm [25] and this community appears to be undergoing a typical successional pattern. Conversely, Parramore Island is directly exposed to disturbance effects, and we document both alternative resilience and lack of resilience in maritime forests based on landscape position, similar to forest islands along the Florida Gulf Coast [29].The alternative form of resilience on Parramore Island is shown by the increase of a woody presence. Woody species functionally have the same response to island erosion, as they are disturbance-resisting species in sensu [11] and will impact island migration in a similar way, creating a temporary form of resilience. Considering the loss of most of its long-lived species, this study demonstrates that forest disassembly (e.g., loss of biodiversity; decrease in species abundance) is taking place on the island. Recruitment of forested species may also be impeded by high saline conditions [36].Based on our data and ongoing research in forest to marsh transitions, we synthesize the possible trajectories for maritime forest due to changes in RSLR and storm disturbance (Figure 7). If salinity and flooding is not sustained in the long term following storm (or other) disturbance, forests may recover and regenerate. Forests near the shoreline are typically lost through erosion processes as documented on Parramore Island (33% maritime forest lost to ocean). In forests experiencing high rates of RSLR or sustained saline flooding through exposure, conversion to salt marsh dominates (i.e., [9]). In our study, we document an alternative form of resilience through conversion of forest to salt-sensitive shrub dominance (primarily Morella cerifera). We suggest an alternative form of resilience through maintaining a woody-dominated state, rather than complete loss of woody biomass that is typically seen in forest to marsh transition and erosion.Unlike coastal forests on the mainland, barrier island forests are often discontinuous due to topography, development, heterogenous distribution of resources, and island size. Coastal topography is particularly sensitive to changes in erosion and accretion from changes in RSLR and coastal storms [12,55], potentially leading to higher rates of forest disassembly. Collectively, biotic and abiotic factors make barrier island maritime forests more susceptible to environmental perturbations affecting coastline dynamics. Although Virginia does not have frequent hurricanes that make landfall, the effect of hurricanes, nor’easters or tropical storms can be expansive and affect forested communities for hundreds of miles outside of the landfall area. Plant communities on barrier islands endure the full force of wind, increased wave height and energy, and salt inundation relative to mainland coastal communities due to their geographic position [56]. Species have differential responses to infrequent disturbances and not all communities may recover to their pre-disturbance state [28]. On Parramore Island, Persea palustris and Juniperus virginiana were lost as dominant species, but Pinus taeda appeared resilient to disturbance as seen in increased number, relative basal area, and importance value over the time period. Juniperus virginiana stands are susceptible to storms and drought, and they have been shown to use less fresh ground when sea level has risen [40], potentially leading to their decline. Pinus taeda germinates at higher salinities compared to many coastal tree species [36], providing an advantage for these conifers on barrier islands. Dispersal of woody species that are tolerant of salinity and flooding is necessary for regeneration of maritime forest.As maritime forest on Parramore Island is declining, shrubs are expanding, which is a phenomenon seen worldwide [57,58]. It is unclear if a threshold has been reached that would implicate a tipping point to continual disassembly of the maritime forest community. Conversion to shrub dominance is occurring elsewhere along the mid-Atlantic and Gulf coasts and is well documented on the Virginia barrier islands [37,48]. Hog Island, VA, had extensive maritime forest ~100 years ago on the southern end which later experienced substantial erosion and loss of forest. Since 1984, there has been a 400% increase in the shrub, Morella cerifera, [48] and no remaining maritime forest or evidence of new maritime forest forming [59]. We quantified a similar trajectory on Parramore Island as M. cerifera increased over the twenty-one-year timeframe and all maritime forest tree species decreased in the study plots. With the expansion of M. cerifera, typical successional patterns are interrupted. Conversion to shrubs may be accelerated as documented elsewhere along the Atlantic coast following salt intrusion due to coastal storms and sea-level rise [60,61]. Additional climate change factors, such as warming winter temperatures, favor M. cerifera expansion along with microclimate modification, creating a positive feedback to maintain a shrub state [62,63]. As M. cerifera takes up more recruitment space and limits forest seedling recruitment below the canopy, tree species may no longer find habitable locations for germination. This may be a mechanism for disassembly of maritime forest on barrier islands in areas where woody species can survive.RSLR may be another factor preventing recovery of forested plots on Parramore Island. High elevation fronting dunes and woody species create resistance; however, over time, these have contributed to higher rates of erosion on the shoreface compared to low-lying elevation areas that allow for landward island migration [33]. As sea level rises, shoreline erosion affects communities inland with increased exposure to winds, salt spray and overwash. Trees that were once within 20 m from the ocean become closer to the ocean [64]. As woody species limit sediment movement into the island [33,65], maritime forest disassembles due to salt exposure, forming ghost forests and reshaping coastlines. When forests dieback, marsh expands into adjacent available habitat [29,35]. Lower elevation on Parramore Island may allow for interior saltwater intrusion during storm events.In the short term, conversion to a shrub state may provide protection to the mainland similar to maritime forest during storm events [11,34]. Morella cerifera is also known to exhibit high annual net primary productivity [66], which may partially compensate for biomass lost through forest decline. However, position on barrier islands with high RSLR, creates temporary alternative resilience paths. Over time, barrier islands will migrate landward or erode if sediment is blocked [33], thus, exposing and affecting all communities that lay beyond. The loss of function would place mainland coastal communities on the forefront of impending storms.", 4. Discussion,None,4
1003,"In order to enhance or support resilience of ecosystems, it is important to know which factors contribute to their maintenance. Geographic location of coastal and maritime forests coupled with elevation may be critical factors that determine how ecosystems will respond to RSLR and may be a significant form of maintenance for maritime forests [33,67,68,69,70,71]. Savage Neck Dunes forest is protected from the full force of storms through position on the bayside and large intact dunes. Fifteen years following Hurricane Isabel, there are no obvious signs of previous disturbance, and it exhibits signs of traditional successional trajectory through increased basal area and reduction in number of trees. Degradation of barrier islands may change the extent to which the coastal mainland is affected by storm disturbance. Even though barrier islands, as well as mainland coastal communities, are typically found behind large dunes, barrier islands are at the forefront of impact by RSLR and storm surge. The disassembly of maritime forest at the forefront of coastal storms on a Virginia barrier island is complex and attributed to disturbance and other climate change factors. Parramore Island has experienced significant loss of dune habitat and maritime forest through loss of land (i.e., erosion into the ocean) due to RSLR and conversion to mesic grassland. Remaining woody vegetation is now dominated by the shrub Morella cerifera, which is expanding due to warming climate. The maintenance of woody dominance through shrub expansion may indicate a temporary, alternative path of resilience as maritime forest is lost.The current study shows a direct comparison of how two coastal ecosystems that are geographically different recover from natural disturbance over the long term. This is important because as islands experience fragmentation, they will not be present to protect the mainland and many mainland communities may be in danger of forest disassembly similar to what the current study has documented on Parramore Island. This is especially important considering the extent to which sea-level rise is contaminating freshwater along coastlines [45].This study also highlights that shrubs can be self-reinforcing and rapidly expanding in areas where trees are decreasing. Future long-term studies should focus on monitoring shrubs over time to examine their capacity to be resilient to environmental perturbations relative to other species. Shrub expansion depends on the capacity of the shrubs to overcome abiotic and biotic stressors. Future studies should also focus on factors that examine the mechanism by which shrubs can encroach across barrier islands into multiple vegetative communities (i.e., grasslands). These studies would provide a greater understanding of future trajectories for barrier islands.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
1004,"Phenology is the study of the timing of vegetation growing/senescence events based on vegetation seasonal dynamics [1]. Satellite observations of land surface provides spatially-continuous time-resolved reflectance data of terrestrial vegetation. Therefore, extracting phenological timing from time-series remote sensing data is an effective tool for monitoring large-scale vegetation dynamics, especially where in-situ observations are lacking (e.g., [2]). Generally, remote sensing of vegetation phenology is based on the seasonal cycle of reflectance-based vegetation indices (VIs). VIs have been regarded as proxies of the green biomass of vegetation canopy, carrying information of leaf greenness and canopy structure [3]. Because VIs often show clear seasonal cycles over mid-high latitude forests, due to seasonal changes of temperature and precipitation [4,5], numerous researches have utilized VI time-series curves to study the phenology of such vegetation.Among all the reflectance-based VIs, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) has been most widely used to understand vegetation phenology at both regional and global scales. NDVI is a proxy of green biomass, which is related to canopy photosynthesis. Many studies used NDVI to track seasonal dynamics of carbon assimilation, comparing NDVI with gross primary production (GPP) which represents the photosynthetic carbon uptake [6,7] over boreal forests. However, NDVI-based durations of growing season and photosynthesis season have been found to be significantly longer than those derived from both tower-based and simulated GPP [8,9]. As a matter of fact, NDVI increases earlier in the spring and decreases later in the fall than GPP. As a result, start of season (SOS) date determined by NDVI is earlier than that determined by GPP while end of season (EOS) date appears to be later. Thus, NDVI is considered not sensitive for tracking photosynthesis dynamics of vegetation alone.However, a direct comparison between NDVI-based phenology and GPP-based phenology may be not reasonable. GPP can be described by the light use efficiency (LUE) model as follows:




GPP
 
=
 
PAR
×
fPAR
×
LUE
 
=
 
APAR
×
LUE
,





(1)


where PAR stands for photosynthetically active radiation (i.e., shortwave solar radiation between 400 nm and 700 nm) and fPAR stands for fraction of absorbed PAR (APAR). LUE model is a conceptual model originated from [10] based on physiological process of light absorption (APAR) and conversion (LUE) [11]. According to the LUE model, dynamics of GPP are jointly controlled by changes of PAR, fPAR and LUE. At seasonal scale, PAR is related to solar zenith angle and fPAR is determined by canopy structure and leaf greenness, which are directly related to NDVI, while LUE dynamics are more complex because it is related not only to vegetation growing status but to environmental (e.g., radiation, temperature and soil water) stress as well. Thus, in order to use NDVI-based phenology to track photosynthesis dynamics, one should also take seasonal cycles of PAR and LUE into consideration.Because VIs have been used as a robust proxy of fPAR [12] while PAR can be obtained from external data sources, many studies have used VI × PAR as a proxy for APAR [8,9]. However, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer- (MODIS-, onboard Aqua and Terra satellite instruments) based APAR is found to overestimate both the greenness season duration and the photosynthesis duration [8], and APAR is temporally biased compared to GPP [13], indicating that VI-based APAR is still not an appropriate proxy for carbon assimilation. Thus, LUE might be the main reason for inconsistencies between APAR-based phenology and GPP-based phenology.LUE can be estimated through narrow-band VIs such as photochemical reflectance index (PRI) [14,15] or by introducing maximum LUE, temperature and precipitation stress factors [16]. However, seasonal changes of LUE that are similar to seasonal VI patterns have been observed by studies over northern hemisphere plants (e.g., [17]). Although directly estimating LUE from VI lacks physically-based theoretical basis, some empirical relation may exist between seasonal VI and LUE. Stagakis, et al. [18] reported a significant linear correlation (determination coefficient, r2 = 0.78) between seasonal NDVI and LUE. Wu et al. [19] found a significant linear relationship between VIs (NDVI and enhanced vegetation index, EVI) and LUE over maize and then used VIs as proxies for LUE at seasonal scale. Based on this scope, a VI-based LUE model is developed:




GPP

where VI could be either NDVI or EVI and m is an empirical adjust parameter which is determined from the calibration dataset. Favorable results have been reported for this model by several studies (e.g., [19,20]).Most of the applications of this model on GPP estimation are site-based, where in-situ flux-based GPP data that are used to calculate parameter m are available. However, for phenology applications, it is not necessary to calculate m from calibration datasets because in these situations we focus on the seasonal fluctuations of the indicators we use rather than their absolute values. If VI is able to be a proxy of LUE at seasonal scale, as is the case reported by previous studies, the VI-based LUE model should be able to improve the VI-based phenology towards tracking photosynthesis dynamics more precisely. Based on this assumption, this study aims to evaluate the performance of VI-based LUE model in tracking the seasonal cycle of GPP and to use this model to improve VI-based vegetation phenology.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
1005,"In this study, we focused on the high-latitude forests (between 50°N and 60°N) over the Northern Hemisphere. This area mainly includes evergreen forests and deciduous forests. These forests play an important role in the global carbon cycle [21], making a substantial contribution to global carbon sink. Besides, these forests are sensitive to global warming, showing an extending growing season under the influence of increasing winter and the spring temperatures [22]. The forests are divided into three sets according to their region and vegetation type, i.e., North American evergreen needleleaf forests (ENF), Europe-Asia (Eurasia) ENF and Eurasia deciduous broadleaf forests (DBF). The landcover information was obtained from MODIS land cover product (MCD12C1, 2011).", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.1. Region and Vegetation Types of Interest,2
1006,"MODIS vegetation index product (MOD13C2) was used in this study because compared to other datasets (e.g., GIMMS NDVI3g), MODIS NDVI is based on narrow-band calculations specifically designed for vegetation monitoring. In addition, MOD13C2 is quality controlled global-gridded (0.05° × 0.05° spatial resolution) monthly average product, which benefits from improved radiometric sensitivity and atmospheric/geometric (bi-directional radiation distribution function, BRDF) corrections [23]. For GPP, we used monthly global products provided by the Max Planck Institute’s Biogeochemical integration group (MPI-BGC). The MPI-BGC GPP products were generated through a machine learning algorithm upscaling flux-tower-based GPP into global 0.5° × 0.5° products [24]. Here we did not use MODIS GPP products (MOD17A2) because MOD17A2 is also based on LUE model and takes MODIS NDVI as a major input. Thus results might be biased when comparing MODIS GPP and VI-based LUE model.The incoming shortwave radiation (SWR) was used in this study as a proxy for PAR. Monthly global SWR data (gridded 1° × 1°) provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (NASA-CERES, a series of satellite instruments) are available at https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/order-data.", 2.

1007,"Monthly NDVI, GPP and radiation data covering a three-year period from 2009 to 2011 were used in this study. The temporal range was determined according to time (the end of 2011) of the latest publicly-available MPI-BGC GPP product. VI and radiation products were resampled to the spatial resolution of GPP product. MOD13C2 products were resampled by mean of regional averaging and CERES SWR products were resample by mean of bilinear interpolation. Then single-pixel-based temporal analyses were conducted at the spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°.To determine the growing season, we used a method proposed by Jeong et al. [22]. This method calculates the dates for SOS and EOS using a threshold of annual maximum of the selected indicators which are NDVI, NDVI × PAR, NDVI2 × PAR and GPP for this study. Seasonal values were firstly normalized to the range [0, 1] using annual maximum and minimum, then a 6-degree polynomial equation was used to fit the seasonal cycle curve and finally the spring and fall dates were calculated according to the selected threshold. In this study we used a threshold of 0.5.", 2. Materials and Methods , 2.3. Data Processing and Growing Season Determination,2
1008,"Four indicators were used in this study to represent the seasonal vegetation dynamics, including NDVI, NDVI × PAR, NDVI2 × PAR and GPP. Normalized regional-mean seasonal cycles from 2009 to 2011 of the selected indicators are shown in Figure 1 by different regions and vegetation types.According to Figure 1, seasonal patterns of the four indicators stayed similar across years, showing a clear seasonal cycle with single-peak around July. North America ENF and Eurasia ENF showed similar patterns while results for Eurasia DBF show some differences. For North America and Eurasia ENF, the NDVI2 × PAR curves nearly perfectly matched the GPP curves, especially during the growing and senescence season. The small discrepancies between the two kinds of curves over peak growing season (June–August) might result from the saturation effect of NDVI. Both NDVI and NDVI × PAR curves were found to overestimate the length of growing season, i.e., inclined earlier while declined later than NDVI2 × PAR and GPP. More discrepancies were found in the fall than in the spring among the seasonal patterns. Much steeper spring increases than fall decreases were found for NDVI over years while the other three indicators showed relatively symmetrical growing and senescence patterns (Figure 1a–f) indicating that NDVI shows more significant lag to photosynthesis (GPP) changes in the fall. Although NDVI × PAR (as a proxy for APAR) curves were much closer to NDVI2 × PAR and GPP curves in the fall, which was consistent with previous study [9], APAR failed to alleviate but tended to aggravate the early increase in the spring (Figure 1a,c,d). Similar results were reported by Walther et al. [13] when using EVI instead of NDVI. In contrast, NDVI2 × PAR curves correspond well to GPP curves in both spring and fall, indicating that besides APAR, LUE also plays an important role in the spring recovery of photosynthesis and the spring LUE changes might be tracked with NDVI. The similar patterns in the fall for the three indicators except for NDVI also indicate that radiation reduction is the main factor leading photosynthesis decrease during that season. Thus, the late fall decrease of NDVI compared to GPP, which is often reported (e.g., [2]), is expected to be alleviated when introducing radiation constraint. In addition, the regional standard deviations of NDVI are largely reduced after multiplying with radiation, indicating that more robust results are expected when using APAR or VI-based LUE model to monitor forests’ seasonal dynamics rather than using NDVI itself.Compared to ENF, DBF shows narrower seasonal cycles (Figure 1g–i). This is due to the fact that in the spring DBF rely on newly grown leaves for photosynthesis while new leaves only give limited contribution to ENF’s total photosynthesis, while in the fall DBF experiences more sharp decline of canopy greenness than ENF. Both NDVI and APAR show broader seasonal cycles than GPP. It is shown that for DBF, the NDVI2 × PAR curves still slightly overestimate the duration of growing season, especially in the spring. This is possibly because photosynthesis for DBF starts only when greenness and temperature increase to a higher level than ENF, leading more lag between spring VIs and GPP. It might be interpreted that it is more difficult to use VIs to track seasonal LUE changes in DBF. One possible explanation lies in that for DBF, seasonal variations of NDVI are jointly affected by changes of canopy structure and leaf pigment while for ENF whose canopy structure shows less seasonal dependence, NDVI variations are mainly explained by changes of canopy pigment concentration, which is directly related to LUE. In this sense, NDVI is more reasonable a proxy for LUE in ENF, where the VI-based LUE model performs better in the present study, than in DBF. Although monitoring phenology over ENF is generally more difficult than over DBF using remote sensing (e.g., [25]), the results in the present study suggest that the VI-based LUE model can track GPP dynamics more precisely in ENF.SOS and EOS dates derived from the four individual curves are displayed by latitude in Figure 2. According to Figure 2, good consistency can be found among the EOS dates derived from the three indicators except for NDVI. EOS dates derived from NDVI are generally 60 days larger and 40 days larger than those derived from the other three indicators for North America and Eurasia respectively. For SOS, dates derived from the four indicators are much closer. NDVI and APAR give 10–20 days’ earlier SOS dates than GPP in both North America and Eurasia. SOS dates based on the NDVI2 × PAR curves keep consistent with those based on GPP curves across latitudes over years in America. In Eurasia, SOS dates based on the former are generally smaller than those based on the latter, especially at higher latitudes. This is because North America consists mainly of ENF while in Eurasia forests are ENF-DBF mixed. In addition, EOS dates were more strongly dependent on latitude than SOS dates, especially over Eurasian forests.", 3. Results,None,3
1009,"NDVI has been widely used to track seasonal dynamics of photosynthesis and phenology based on NDVI are often compared to both flux tower measurements and remote sensing measurements. Not surprisingly, NDVI-based growing season has been found to be longer than GPP-based growing season. This is because, in the spring, photosynthesis lags behind leaf growth [26] while in the fall, leaf decay lags behind photosynthesis decline [25]. In order to improve VI-based phenology, temperature, which high-latitude forests are sensitive to and therefore dominating their phenology, is often taken into consideration (e.g., [7]). However, for boreal forests whose phenology is mainly determined by environmental factors, seasonal VI cycles also carry information of temperature and precipitation. Instead of introducing environmental stress factors, the present study aims to improve NDVI-based phenology at the perspective of using VI-based GPP estimation model.Because NDVI has been considered as a proxy for fPAR, the key of using the VI-based LUE model to track seasonal cycles of GPP is whether NDVI can be a reasonable proxy for LUE at seasonal scale. Remote sensing of LUE from greenness-related VIs is challenging due to the fact that LUE is jointly controlled by multiple factors and is sensitive to changes of environmental stress. As a matter of fact, VIs often show obvious lag when environmental stress occurs. At short-term scale (e.g., diurnal), where physiological factors such as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) dominate LUE changes [15], greenness-related VIs generally fail to track LUE changes [14]. At seasonal scale, however, both LUE and NDVI are sensitive to canopy chlorophyll concentration [27,28]. Thus NDVI may track seasonal changes of LUE. These facts give opportunities for using VI as a proxy for LUE at seasonal scale, especially for phenology study. As a matter of fact, linear relationships between seasonal NDVI and LUE has been reported by empirical analyses [18,19]. Another possible reason for why NDVI-based phenology is improved by applying VI-based LUE model is that NDVI2 might be a good proxy for ecosystem/apparent LUE (i.e., the ratio of GPP and PAR). Numerically, squaring NDVI gives smaller value and the squared NDVI can be closer to actual fPAR related to GPP due to the fact that only a part of the canopy APAR (PAR absorbed by photosynthetically related pigments) is used for photosynthesis. Since LUE model is conceptual [11], NDVI2 × PAR might be a direct estimation of GPP regardless of using one NDVI as proxy for fPAR while using another as proxy for LUE.Results of the present study show that VI-based phenology is improved towards better tracking seasonal photosynthesis (GPP) dynamics through applying a VI-based LUE model. Better performance of the proposed method is found over ENF than DBF. This is because VI and photosynthesis have different mutual influencing mechanisms over these two plant functional types. NDVI variations of ENF are more controlled than those of DBF by changes of canopy pigment concentration, which is the main factor determining canopy LUE. Using remotely sensed VIs to monitor phenology over ENF is generally more difficult because ENF has smaller annual VI fluctuations. A limitation of this study is that errors of MPI-GPP were not considered although MPI-GPP is generally considered to have overall good quality.", 4. Discussion,None,4
1010,"In this study, we investigate the feasibility of using the VI-based LUE model to track seasonal dynamics of GPP over high-latitude forests. Our results showed that VI-based phenology of ENF can be significantly improved through applying the VI-based LUE model. One of the potential advantages of using VI-based LUE model to monitor photosynthesis dynamics is that apart from VI, no external data source is required except for PAR, which can be easily obtained from satellite or in-situ observations. Another advantage is that there is no need to estimate absolute LUE or GPP values, neither of which can be directly obtained from remote sensing data. Several recent studies have employed satellite-based solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to track seasonal photosynthesis cycles, as SIF has been considered as a proxy for GPP [29]. The advantage of using SIF to monitor phenology is that it carries information of PAR, fPAR (greenness) and LUE [30]. However, as satellite retrieval of SIF could be noisy and global long-term SIF products are lacking, VI is still the most widely used indicator for the phenology study. Our results show the potential of using VI-based LUE model to monitor photosynthesis dynamics more precisely.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
1011,"Salt marshes are considered not only the most productive and vast coastal ecosystems on the planet [1], but also the most complex ecological units as they support a variety of meso- and macro-fauna [2,3]. Salt marshes facilitate the development of biological processes (e.g., nutrient cycling, pollutant filtration, carbon storage, nitrogen cycle) [2,4], and contribute to storm surge dissipation and shoreline protection [5,6]. Tidal salt marshes are subject to tidal influence and sea level rise (SLR) as they grow within low-energy intertidal zones [7]. In general, moderate to high SLR rates can permanently inundate low marsh regions affecting the dynamics between tides and marsh biomass productivity. Moreover, elevated coastal water levels on marsh regions can influence the fate of sediments, salinity intrusion and nutrient availability, and ultimately transform tidal salt marshes into mudflats or open water [8,9,10,11]. Nevertheless, tidal salt marshes cope with SLR by controlling the overall sediment balance of the marsh platform (i.e., release or storage of sediments) and hence enabling the marsh platform to accrete and keep pace with rising water levels [12]. Furthermore, tidal salt marshes can adapt to changes in sediment supply and salinity by migrating to higher non-urbanized lands [13,14,15,16]; as a result, salt marsh migration can alter the land cover distribution of emergent wetlands delineated in the 2016 National Land Cover Database (NLCD) map.The 2016 NLCD is a multi-temporal (2001–2016) land cover/land change database of the conterminous United States developed by the U.S. Geological survey (USGS) in collaboration with several federal agencies [17]. The land cover classification process in the 2016 NLCD consisted in a comprehensive data analysis of Landsat imagery of moderate (30 m) spatial resolution and cloud cover less than 20%, integration of ancillary datasets, image segmentation and decision tree classification techniques; and post-classification refinement process. As a result, the 2016 NLCD exhibits an overall agreement between land cover classification maps and reference data ranging from 71% to 97% [17]. The 2016 NLCD metadata file provides a list of code-values with a short description of land cover classes in the classification map. For example, the wetland class is classified in two groups: ‘Woody Wetlands’ (code-value 90) and ‘Emergent Herbaceous Wetlands’ (code-value 95). The second group in turn can be separated into two classes ‘Freshwater Emergent Wetlands’ and ‘Estuarine and Marine Wetlands’ according to the National Wetland Inventory (NWI) [18]. The last class is of particular interest for this study specially in estuarine systems of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the U.S. emergent wetlands growing in those estuarine systems consist in (periodically inundated) perennial herbaceous vegetation with saltmarsh cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora), saltmeadow cordgrass (Spartina patens), big cordgrass (Spartina cynosuroides), needlerush (Juncus roemerianus), narrow-leaved cattail (Typha angustifolia), and southern wild rice (Zizaniopsis miliacea) as dominant species [18].Over the last decade, the application of random forest (RF) and object-based image analysis (OBIA) to imagery datasets has proven to be a robust, stable and superior methodology for land cover mapping and land change analysis on a variety of landscapes (e.g., urban areas, wetlands, agricultural areas, natural forests) [19,20,21,22]. RF and OBIA present advantages over other classifiers (e.g., decision tree, maximum likelihood, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, artificial neural network) and over traditionally (sub)pixel-based classification techniques (e.g., supervised, unsupervised, contextual, hybrid, fuzzy, spectral mixture) [23,24,25]. RF is a non-parametric ensemble algorithm that builds a large number of random decision trees based on random bootstrapped samples of training data to conduct a classification [26]. The major advantage of RF relies on its simplicity and easy implementation with multiple parameters for efficient multi-class classification [27]. Likewise, the major advantage of OBIA relies on its reduction of within-class variability since image segmentation can effectively represent land cover classes as ground truth objects [22]. Moreover, OBIA has demonstrated superior performance on imagery of both high and moderate spatial resolution such as Landsat images [28]. Applying RF and OBIA to high (~2 m) and medium (30 m) resolution images (e.g., WorldView-2, QuickBird, IKONOS, Landsat 8-OLI/TM/ETM+) can lead to mean overall accuracies above 83% [22,24], which suggests further application for land cover classification and land change analysis in present-day imagery datasets.When integrating land cover classification maps and digital elevation models (DEMs) for flood inundation mapping, a common issue over permanent tidal salt marsh regions (and migrating marsh communities) is the surface elevation error, specifically in DEMs derived from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) methods. Despite the usefulness and widespread application of LiDAR-derived DEMs over coastal areas [29,30,31,32,33], several studies have argued that elevation errors arise in vegetated areas, especially in salt marsh species [6,8,23,34,35]. The surface elevation error is calculated as the difference in elevation between LiDAR-derived DEMs and true ground-surface elevation; usually collected during real-time kinematic (RTK) topographic surveys [6,23,34,36]. The highest LiDAR elevation errors have been found in salt marsh species located along estuarine creeks with tall dense grasses (up to 2 m) such as Spartina alterniflora [6,35], where overestimation of surface elevation can reach values up to 0.65 m [5]. In order to rectify the surface elevation error in salt marshes, several studies have applied elevation adjustments and/or correction methods to LiDAR-derived DEM datasets. For example, DEM corrections are made by analyzing above-ground biomass variation in coastal marshes [5]; using correction factors based on vegetation species [23]; analyzing the effects of seasonality, vegetation species and LiDAR processing/filtering methods on elevation uncertainty [6]; and applying location-specific, point-by-point corrections from LiDAR waveform-derived features [35].In one recent study, Alizad et al. [8] conducted a global LiDAR-derived DEM correction in marsh regions of Grand Bay in Mississippi and Weeks Bay in Alabama, USA. The authors adjusted salt marsh platform elevation of the bays based on marsh productivity and above-ground biomass density of biologically similar species to a nearby estuarine system at Apalachicola Bay in Florida, USA. The salt marsh platform of the two bays was therefore vertically positioned relative to the tidal frame similar to Apalachicola Bay. However, the aforementioned process to correct salt marsh elevation has not been automated for reproducibility in other estuaries. Moreover, land cover update within emergent herbaceous wetlands of the NLCD is usually neglected, making this updated layer of value for similar analyses. Our approach integrates OBIA and RF techniques with the 2016 NLCD in order to update emergent wetland regions through a hierarchical approach and to correct the elevation of salt marsh regions. For this purpose, we first update emergent wetland regions of Weeks Bay, Alabama, Savannah Estuary, Georgia and Fire Island, New York to the year 2019, and then we develop an automated salt marsh elevation correction tool in ArcGIS to generate a modified (corrected) DEM. Our approach and DEM-correction tool can be easily adapted and applied to other estuarine systems supporting different marsh vegetation species in emergent herbaceous wetland regions.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
1012,"We selected two estuarine systems and one barrier island for this study: Weeks Bay, located on the Gulf of Mexico Coast of the United States, and Savannah Estuary and Fire Island, located on the Atlantic Coast of the United States. We studied these two estuaries with different hydro-morphological characteristics such as size, mean depth, riverine to tidal influence, anthropogenic interventions and ecological characteristics to assess the broader applicability of our proposed methodology in different estuarine systems. In addition, we extended our analysis on Fire Island to validate our results with publicly available RTK topographic survey data.Weeks Bay is a shallow, diamond shaped, microtidal estuary located along the eastern shore of Mobile Bay in Baldwin County, Alabama (Figure 1a). Weeks Bay is a tributary estuary of Mobile Bay and has been designated as a National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) site since 1986 [37]. The estuary has a surface area of approximately 7 km2 with a longitudinal axis (north to south) of 3.4 km and a transversal axis (west to east) of 3.1 km [38]. Freshwater discharge into the estuary comes from the Fish River and Magnolia River located at the northern and eastern sides of the Bay, respectively. Fish River provides ~73% of total freshwater input (~ 9 m3/s), while Magnolia River supplies the rest. Mean depth of Weeks Bay is about 1.5 m, with maximum local depths up to 7 m (see the deep area connecting Bon Secour Bay to Weeks Bay for example) [39]. The tidal regime is predominantly diurnal with tidal range of 0.4 m and currents exceeding 1 m/s at the mouth of the bay [40]. The estuarine system consists of deepwater tidal habitats and adjacent tidal wetlands which are regularly flooded by tides [18].Savannah River originates at the confluence of the Tulagoo and Seneca Rivers at Hartwell, Georgia and debouches into the Atlantic Ocean (Figure 1b). The river flows in a southeastern direction and serves as a ~500 km natural border of South Carolina and Georgia. Savannah River estuary extents from Port Wentworth to Fort Pulaski (at the estuary mouth) and comprises the lower ~50 km of the river [41]. The river channel from Port Wentworth to Tybee Range has been deepened for navigation purposes with a mean depth of 12 m below mean low water as reported by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers [42]. Furthermore, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed three major dams (J. Strom Thurmond, Richard B. Russell, and Hartwell) on the Savannah River, mainly for hydroelectric generation, flood control and water supply management purposes [43]. Savannah River at Port Wentworth trifurcates in distributary channels named Front, Middle and Back rivers as (Figure 1b). The annual averaged discharge to the estuary and tidal range at the estuary mouth are approximately 359 m3/s and 2.5 m, respectively [41]. The estuarine system consists of deepwater tidal habitats and adjacent tidal wetlands which are regularly flooded by tides, and partly drained wetlands that have been altered hydrologically. Anthropogenic intervention is also evident in wetlands containing and connected to ditches [18].Fire Island, a 50-km-long barrier island with varying width from 200 m to 1 km [44], is located at the south shore of Long Island in Suffolk County, New York (Figure 1c). The island holds a variety of salt marsh species and vegetation distributed along the barrier. Fire Island is currently constrained by two main tidal inlets used as navigation channels: Fire Island Inlet to the west and Moriches Inlet to the east. The barrier island has been affected by extreme storm surges, such as Hurricane Sandy in 2012 which caused overwash on 41% of Fire Island and modified its shape due to large amount of sediment accumulation (approximately 50,800 m3) [20]. From fall 2014 to spring 2016, an extensive RTK topographic survey over salt marsh regions was conducted on Fire Island as described in Section 2.2. These data are further used in Section 3.4 for validation of the proposed tool.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Area,2
1013,"We used imagery datasets (i.e., band collection) from both Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS (Collection 1 Level-1) and Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) archives since the application of the former in land cover classification is affected by atmospheric errors [21]. Contrary to Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, Landsat ARD is a surface reflectance product [45] with imagery corrected for atmospheric attenuation (e.g., scattering and absorption effects). However, Landsat ARD does not contain the thermal and panchromatic bands as they are not surface reflectance products. We used the panchromatic bands of Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS to enhance the spatial resolution of the images in OBIA and RF as further described in Section 2.4. Both datasets, covering the hydrologic catchments of the study areas in 2016 and 2019, are open source and can be obtained from the Earth Explorer website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov). In addition to the imagery datasets, we used the geo-database of the NWI (https://fwsprimary.wim.usgs.gov/wetlands/apps/wetlands-mapper/) and the ‘C-CAP 2010-Era Land Cover’ map (https://coast.noaa.gov/digitalcoast/tools/lca.html) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the National Ocean Service (NOS) as references to discriminate emergent wetlands in the study area.We obtained LiDAR-derived DEMs of Weeks Bay (i.e., 2014 Northern Gulf of Mexico dataset), Savannah Estuary (i.e., 2017 Coastal South Carolina dataset), and Fire Island (i.e., 2017 East Coast dataset) from NOAA’s Data Access Viewer (https://coast.noaa.gov/dataviewer/#). The DEMs have horizontal datum: UTM Zone 16N, 17N and 18N—North American Datum 1983 projection (NAD83); North American Vertical Datum 1988: NAVD88; and spatial resolution: ~3 × 3 m (1/9th arc-second), 1 × 1 m and 1 × 1 m, respectively. We also obtained information about the mean high water (MHW), mean sea level (MSL) and mean low water (MLW) datum referenced to NAVD88 for surface elevation correction (described in Section 2.5) from NOAA (https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov).For validation of the DEM-correction tool, we used a set of 1530 RTK points (i.e., ground-truth marsh elevation) collected by staff of the Environmental Data Center (EDC) in cooperation with the Northeast Coastal and Barrier Network (NCBN) at strategic marsh locations in Fire Island (Figure 1c). This dataset is publicly available and can be obtained from the Integrated Resource Management Applications (IRMA) database (https://irma.nps.gov/DataStore/Reference/Profile/2240329). The RTK data has a spatial resolution of 20 m referenced with respect to horizontal datum: UTM Zone 18N—NAD83 (2011) and vertical datum: NAVD88.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Data,2
1014,"We selected the time frame of single images in this study based on two conditions: (1) consistency with Landsat imagery used in the 2016 NLCD for land cover classification over the study areas; and (2) imagery preferably captured within MLW in order to avoid tidal inundation effects land cover classification [46,47]. In addition, we obtained Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS and ARD images from Earth Explorer applying a cloud cover filter less than 20% in order to be consistent with the proposed steps for land cover classification of the 2016 NLCD [17]. We further preprocessed some images with the fmask tool [48] to get rid of clouds and shadows in our analyses. A summary of the imagery datasets used in this study including tidal stage during image acquisition is presented in Table 1. The selected tidal gauges for Weeks Bay, Savannah Estuary and Fire Island were Dauphin Island, Alabama (NOAA station 8735180), Fort Pulaski, Georgia (NOAA station 8670870) and Great South Bay at Watch Hill, New York (USGS station 01305575), respectively.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Imagery Preprocessing,2
1015,"The updating process of emergent wetland regions to present-day (2019) conditions involved three steps: (1) image segmentation with OBIA; (2) feature and land cover class extraction; and (3) training and validation with RF technique. 2.4.1. Image Segmentation with OBIATo conduct the image segmentation, we first masked the clouds and shadows in the study area with the fmask tool [48] and then pansharpened the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery datasets (Table 1) with the Gram–Schmidt method (ArcGIS 10.6.1) as suggested in similar studies [19,49]. The pansharpening process leverages the high spatial resolution of the panchromatic band (15 m) and replaces its low spectral resolution with the high spectral resolution of the other bands in the band collection. The multispectral bands used in this process (with equal band weight) were B5 (near-infrared); B3 (green); B2 (blue); B8 (panchromatic). It is important to note that B5 was preferred over B4 (red) since the near-infrared band can better distinguish differences in spectral signatures from vegetated and non-vegetated areas [21,50]. The resulting multispectral images therefore have high spatial and spectral resolution, and also highlight vegetated areas of the study area. We then used OBIA to divide the multispectral images into heterogeneous polygons (or objects) comprising areas with similar spectral properties. The objects were generated through the ‘Mean-Shift’ segmentation algorithm included in the Orfeo Toolbox (OTB 6.6.0) [51], and available in QGIS as an external plugin. This method has been used in other studies with satisfactory results [20,52,53]. It is worth mentioning that the polygon heterogeneity (i.e., size of the objects) is controlled by user-defined parameters. The main parameters used in this study and their corresponding values are spatial radius (5), range/spectral radius (10), and minimum region size (15). The remaining parameters were set to default values. The optimal (main) parameter-values were found empirically by testing different sets of values systematically (e.g., ranging from 5 to 40) [23]. This process was repeated until emergent wetland regions were properly delineated and/or separated from open water. Furthermore, the resulting polygons were visually compared to reference land cover maps (e.g., C-CAP and NWI). 2.4.2. Feature and Land Cover Class ExtractionAt this stage we computed and extracted features and land cover classes to build a learning database for the RF algorithm. Since the Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS imagery is affected by atmospheric attenuation [21,45], we conducted feature extraction from ARD imagery that is a surface reflectance product (Table 1). We classified the computed features in three groups: reflectance, spectral and textural indices [19,21]. The reflectance features, characterized via mean, standard deviation and range, were obtained from two multispectral band compositions: B4 (red); B3 (green); B2 (blue) and B5 (near-infrared); B3; B2. The spectral and textural indices from vegetated and non-vegetated areas are characterized via mean and standard deviation (SD) as indicated in Table 2. Moreover, the number of variables ‘p’ is 28 as presented in the same table. The textural indices were computed with both the ‘Haralick Texture’ features of OTB in QGIs and ‘Focal Statistics’ in ArcGIS; and based on window sizes of 5 × 5 pixels with band composition of B5; B3; B2; B. B5 was preferred over B4 as the near-infrared band might contrast better soil-vegetation discontinuities than the red band [19]. Haralick texture is a widely used parameter for texture recognition as it measures consistency of patterns and colors in image objects [54]. Focal statistics computes a set of statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, range) based on information of neighbor raster cells, and hence identifies image objects sharing similar properties (e.g., reflectance, spectral and textural). Lastly, we extracted the land cover classes of Weeks Bay and Savannah Estuary from the 2016 NLCD to further train and validate the RF algorithm as described in the next section. 2.4.3. Training and Validation with Random ForestIn this stage, we trained and validated the RF learning algorithm in Python 3.7 with the features extracted from the 2016 imagery and the land cover classes of the 2016 NLCD. This process requires three steps: (i) assembling the learning database; (ii) establishing a hierarchical approach for land cover classification; and (iii) hyperparameter tuning of the random forest algorithm including accuracy assessment. The ultimate goal of this stage was to classify and update emergent wetland regions in the 2019 imagery as described in Section 3.3.• Assembling the learning databaseWe used ArcGIS to join and relate all the features and land cover classes extracted in the second stage to the polygons (or objects) generated through image segmentation in the first stage. Hence, each polygon feature (identified with a unique ID) displays a set of reflectance, spectral and textural indices that belongs to a specific land cover class. Since the numbers of objects generated in Weeks Bay and Savannah Estuary are relatively large (i.e., 102,983 and 105,580, respectively), we trained and validated the RF with a random sample consisting of 25% of all the polygon features per study area in order to reduce computation effort while also ensuring model robustness. Moreover, large training sample sizes could affect the proportion between land cover classes, and thus decreasing the overall accuracy of the RF algorithm [55]. The total number of objects generated in Fire Island, on the other hand, was approximately 5% of those of Weeks Bay or Savannah Estuary (i.e., 5026). This in turn suggests that the random sample could be increased as there is always a trade-off between high accuracy (model robustness) and computation time. We therefore used a random sample consisting of 50% of all polygon features for Fire Island. Furthermore, we dealt with unbalanced data in the sampling process by computing the class weight of each land cover class and using a fixed seed value (i.e., random state = 0) for reproducibility. The sample data therefore had a balanced number of polygons per land cover class. Likewise, we divided the sample data into two parts for training (70%) and validation (30%) with the fixed seed value to ensure reproducibility.• Hierarchical approach for land cover classificationWe followed a hierarchical approach to discriminate land cover classes from each other. Contrary to the classical approach, in which the entire learning database is used to generate RF classifiers at each nomenclature level, the hierarchical approach separates the database according to user-defined levels and then generates classifiers for each nomenclature level. Moreover, this approach significantly improves land cover classification accuracy at all nomenclature levels, compared with the classical approach as reported in Lebourgeois et al. [19]. In this study, we arranged the polygon features (and associated indices) into three levels based on the 2016 NLCD classification: (L1) urban and non-urban areas, (L2) vegetated and non-vegetated areas and (L3) wetland areas, as indicated in Table 3. The number of polygons per level and study area is mentioned between parentheses below each land cover class.• Hyperparameter tuning of random forest and accuracy assessmentThe next step was to find optimal hyperparameter values to build the decision tree classifiers in the RF algorithm. We used the scikit-learn tool package of Python to conduct a ‘Hyperparameter Tuning’, and hence account for overfitting through cross-validation (CV) [56]. For the hyperparameter tuning, we first created a grid with empirical range-values based on recent studies [55,57,58,59,60]. We randomly generated the hyperparameter values within the established ranges, avoiding a fixed interval between two consecutive values as indicated in Table 4. In addition, we use a ‘stratified k-fold’ approach to divide the data into training and testing sets in the CV process. The number of k-folds is set to 5 as suggested in similar studies [19,61,62] and the grid is generated with the fixed seed value for reproducibility. We then used the grid in the ‘Randomized Search CV’ function to randomly sample a set of hyperparameter values and conduct a stratified k-fold CV with each combination of values. The number of combinations to be tested in the function is defined by the ‘n_iter’ parameter which in our study was set to 100. As a result, the total number of fits, defined as k-folds × n_iter, led to 500 CV computations.To determine the best combination of values, each single combination was evaluated recursively in the validation dataset (i.e., 30% of the sampling data) by generating a confusion matrix and calculating three metrics related to land cover classification: overall accuracy, f1-score (per class and macro), and Kappa coefficient. These metrics have been widely used to assess land cover classification in multiple studies [19,20,21,43,55,58]. Hence, we quantitatively assessed actual vs. computed land cover class of each polygon (or object). Lastly, we defined the optimal hyperparameter values of each study area by refining our search around the best combination of values determined with the previous function. We use the ‘Grid Search CV’ function to evaluate specific user-defined combinations of values and obtain the highest metrics per study area. The optimal hyperparameter values and the corresponding accuracy assessment indices are presented in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, respectively.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4.

In this study, we arranged the polygon features (and associated indices) into three levels based on the 2016 NLCD classification: (L1) urban and non-urban areas, (L2) vegetated and non-vegetated areas and (L3) wetland areas, as indicated in Table 3. The number of polygons per level and study area is mentioned between parentheses below each land cover class.• Hyperparameter tuning of random forest and accuracy assessmentThe next step was to find optimal hyperparameter values to build the decision tree classifiers in the RF algorithm. We used the scikit-learn tool package of Python to conduct a ‘Hyperparameter Tuning’, and hence account for overfitting through cross-validation (CV) [56]. For the hyperparameter tuning, we first created a grid with empirical range-values based on recent studies [55,57,58,59,60]. We randomly generated the hyperparameter values within the established ranges, avoiding a fixed interval between two consecutive values as indicated in Table 4. In addition, we use a ‘stratified k-fold’ approach to divide the data into training and testing sets in the CV process. The number of k-folds is set to 5 as suggested in similar studies [19,61,62] and the grid is generated with the fixed seed value for reproducibility. We then used the grid in the ‘Randomized Search CV’ function to randomly sample a set of hyperparameter values and conduct a stratified k-fold CV with each combination of values. The number of combinations to be tested in the function is defined by the ‘n_iter’ parameter which in our study was set to 100. As a result, the total number of fits, defined as k-folds × n_iter, led to 500 CV computations.To determine the best combination of values, each single combination was evaluated recursively in the validation dataset (i.e., 30% of the sampling data) by generating a confusion matrix and calculating three metrics related to land cover classification: overall accuracy, f1-score (per class and macro), and Kappa coefficient. These metrics have been widely used to assess land cover classification in multiple studies [19,20,21,43,55,58]. Hence, we quantitatively assessed actual vs. computed land cover class of each polygon (or object). Lastly, we defined the optimal hyperparameter values of each study area by refining our search around the best combination of values determined with the previous function. We use the ‘Grid Search CV’ function to evaluate specific user-defined combinations of values and obtain the highest metrics per study area. The optimal hyperparameter values and the corresponding accuracy assessment indices are presented in Section 3.1 and Section 3.2, respectively.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4.3.

1019,"Emergent wetlands growing in estuarine systems of the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts of the U.S. consist of different vegetation species, but salt marshes in particular lead to the highest LiDAR elevation errors [6,35]. Therefore, we selected those regions for further elevation adjustment and DEM correction. Alizad et al. [8] corrected salt marsh elevation in Grand Bay and Weeks Bay in terms of marsh productivity and above-ground biomass density of vegetation species from Apalachicola Bay. The authors pointed out that marsh productive areas in the Apalachicola Bay are located in the upper portion of the tidal frame, and hence this elevation can be used to guide the salt marsh platform adjustment in the other two bays. Furthermore, they proposed the following equation to vertically position salt marsh platforms relative to the tidal frame similar to Apalachicola Bay:

where zadj is the adjusted elevation; u and l are the desired upper and lower limits of the adjusted elevation, respectively; and zmax and zmin are the actual maximum and minimum raw elevations (zraw) of the DEM cell to be adjusted in the domain. It is important to note that elevations lower than (or equal to) a threshold value (i.e., lower limit) should not be adjusted as this would unnecessarily flatten the micro-topography of small tidal creeks, and consequently alter the inundation patterns [8].To apply Equation (1) in Weeks Bay and Savannah Estuary, we referenced MHW, MSL and MLW with respect to the vertical datum NAVD88 of Dauphin Island and Fort Pulaski, respectively (Table 1). Although Fire Island has its own representative tidal gauge (i.e., USGS station 01305575), this station has been recording water heights since mid-April 2016 to present. As a result, the present National Tidal Datum Epoch (i.e., from 1983 up to 2001) used to calculate MHW, MSL and MLW is outside the time-frame of available water height records. We therefore estimated these datum data from a nearby tidal gauge station with longer records located at Montauk, New York (NOAA station 8510560). The upper tide range was calculated by subtracting MSL from MHW, and the upper midpoint of the tidal frame (lower limit) by adding half of the upper tide range to the MSL. Also, the upper limit was calculated by adding the upper tide range to the MHW, and zmax obtained from a frequency analysis of salt marsh elevation in the unadjusted DEM. A summary of these variables is presented in Table 5. Implementation of the DEM-Correction ToolWe used Table 5 and Equation (1) to implement a tool aimed at automating salt marsh elevation correction. Since Equation (1) is based on salt marsh productivity and above-ground biomass density of biologically similar species, we assume the equation does not alter the natural elevation of other vegetated species contained in the emergent herbaceous wetland class. The implementation of the DEM-correction tools is described as follows.First, the tool extracts the ground-surface elevation points of emergent herbaceous wetlands from the DEM (i.e., zraw) with a nearest neighbor resampling technique. We used the ‘Sample’ tool to create a temporary lookup table containing the raster cell-values from those regions (i.e., X, Y and Z-coordinates). Subsequently, we extract the maximum and minimum elevations (i.e., zmax and zmin) of the emergent wetland regions from the lookup table. The second and third steps are to calculate the adjusted elevation (i.e., zadj) as indicated in Equation (1) and compare this value to the threshold value (i.e., lower limit). The resulting ‘Emergent Herbaceous wetland elevation’ dataset is then manually transformed into point features through the ‘Add XY data’ option in ArcGIS and stored in a shape file format for further use. The fourth step is to convert the point features in raster cell-values through the ‘Point to Raster’ tool. We set the cell size, cell assignment type and value/priority field to 3 m, mean value and ‘Elevation’, respectively. The remaining parameters of the tool were set to default. The final step is to combine the resulting ‘Emergent Herbaceous wetland Raster’ dataset with the DEM input of Weeks Bay or Savannah Estuary. We use the tool ‘Mosaic to New Raster’ to merge the two raster datasets by prioritizing the adjusted raster cell-values of the salt marsh regions with the ‘Mosaic Operator’ parameter. Finally, we set the cell size, pixel type, and number of bands to 3 m, 32-bit float and single band, respectively. Figure 2 presents a workflow of the DEM-correction tool created in Model Builder of ArcGIS.

1021,"We conducted hyperparameter tuning in the two estuaries separately. The optimal values at each nomenclature level were almost identical with slight variations (i.e., order of units) mainly in the number of estimators and maximum features. For that reason, we used the same optimal values at each nomenclature level for further computations. Table 6 presents the optimal values per study area. In general, the optimal hyperparameter values were not far from each other when comparing the two estuaries. The largest difference was observed in the number of estimators, which was greater by 50 units in Savannah Estuary.", 3. Results, 3.1. Optimal Hyperparameter Values,3
1022,"We quantitatively assessed the accuracy of land cover classification at each nomenclature level in terms of overall accuracy, f1-score (class and macro) and Kappa coefficient as presented in Table 7. At the first level (L1), the RF was able to discriminate urban from non-urban areas with moderate-high to high accuracies regarding the three metrics. Nevertheless, the Kappa coefficient was relatively low in Weeks Bay with a value of 0.62. At the second level (L2), the RF algorithm discriminated the land cover classes within the two groups of L1. When comparing the metrics of developed areas to undeveloped areas (i.e., open water, forests, crops, wetlands, etc.), we observe that RF was slightly better in identifying vegetated areas than developed areas. This might be related to the large extent of shrubs and wetlands around the estuaries, even though we dealt with unbalanced classes when sampling the data (see Section 2.4.3 for details). Moreover, the latter may have led the RF to learn more about the properties of those land covers compared to developed areas. As a result, the highest class f1-score belonged to shrubs in Weeks Bay (0.74) and wetlands in Savannah Estuary (0.80). At the third level (L3), the metrics suggested that RF algorithm was able to identify emergent herbaceous wetlands with high accuracies (up to 0.97). As expected, better results were derived from Savannah Estuary due to its larger wetland areas.", 3. Results, 3.2. Accuracy Assessment of Land Cover Classification,3

Figure 3 shows land cover change detection within emergent wetland areas obtained with OBIA and RF.

1024,"We used the DEM-correction tool to adjust marsh elevation and generate a modified DEM. In order to compare the existing and modified DEM, we computed the overestimation in surface elevation over marsh regions as presented in Figure 4. The largest overestimation was observed in Weeks Bay with maximum values of 0.50 m followed by Fire Island and Savannah Estuary with 0.35 and 0.25 m, respectively. After surface elevation correction, no manual adjustment was conducted to ensure a proper evaluation of the proposed tool as described in the next section. DEM-Correction Accuracy AssessmentWe evaluated the performance of the DEM-correction tool by conducting statistical analyses of ground-truth marsh elevation points (i.e., RTK) of Fire Island (Figure 1c). Likewise, we used the spatial (x-y) coordinates of each point to extract the overlying elevation of the adjusted (zadj) and unadjusted (zraw) DEM. We then compared these elevations under the assumption that the entire emergent herbaceous wetland class follows a normal distribution as indicated in Figure 5a. We also conducted an analysis of frequency of errors (i.e., residuals) to evaluate the performance of the DEM-correction tool in mean error reduction (Figure 5b). For convenience, we also calculated the residual between zadj and RTK.

1026,"Although several studies have used default parameter values (or recommended values) in RF with satisfactory results [21,43,63,64], tuned parameter values can improve the performance of RF and thus lead to high accuracy in land cover classification [55,60]. In this study, we followed a hyperparameter tuning approach with stratified 5-fold cross-validation for Weeks Bay, Savannah Estuary and Fire Island, separately. As reported in similar studies [19,26,43], the recommended number of trees is 500 and the maximum number of features is given by p1/2 (e.g., we set p = 28 and/or p1/2 ~ 5 as indicated in Section 2.4.2). The last parameter value differs moderately (order of tens) with respect to the optimal values we presented in Table 6 even though the number of trees is close to the values reported in this study. In addition, we observed slight variations of optimal values (order of units) at each nomenclature level and study area, and for that reason, we used constant optimal values in further computations (Table 6). Nonetheless, the results with constant optimal values led to land cover classification with moderate to high accuracies at each nomenclature level (Table 7).Since this study is focused on updating emergent wetlands, we trained the RF with a third nomenclature level which in turn produced the highest accuracies in Weeks Bay, Savannah Estuary and Fire Island regarding the f1-scores (0.88, 0.97, 0.97), Kappa coefficient (0.80, 0.95, 0.66) and overall accuracy (0.91, 0.97, 0.95) in the 2016 imagery dataset. We ultimately used the optimal parameter values to discriminate emergent herbaceous wetlands (among other land cover classes) in the 2019 imagery dataset since the NLCD is infrequently updated. Hence, using an updated wetland class is of value as for further analysis such as salt marsh migration patterns due to sea level rise and coastal erosion. Figure 3 highlights wetland areas in the two estuaries and barrier island which have been visually validated with 2019 Landsat imagery. The validation suggests that developed (urban) zones (e.g., <1800 m2 or 3 pixel units) surrounded by larger emergent herbaceous wetland areas (e.g., Savannah Estuary and Fire Island) are often misclassified mainly due to the moderate resolution of Landsat imagery, which is not able to accurately discriminate these two areas even with pansharpened images. Misclassification errors could be overcome by either using available high or ultra-high resolution imagery as indicated in similar studies [20,23,65,66] as well as reducing the size of objects in the image segmentation process. Even though smaller objects can better delineate urban features (e.g., streets, parking lots, squares), they might also increase computation effort when integrating OBIA and RF in large catchment areas (e.g., Lower Savannah, Figure 3b).We evaluated salt marsh elevation correction comparing the difference in elevation within corrected (modified) and original DEMs (Figure 4). Even though salt marsh areas in Savannah Estuary and Fire Island are larger than Weeks Bay, we obtained the largest overestimation in elevation (up to 0.50 m) in Weeks Bay, probably due to different LiDAR-derived DEM inputs for each estuary. As described in Section 2.2, the most updated DEM of Weeks Bay, Savannah Estuary and Fire Island correspond to 2014, 2017 and 2017, respectively. Therefore, Weeks Bay is likely to present relatively larger vertical errors, compared to the other study areas, due to salt marsh migration and/or land cover change effects. Savannah, on the other hand, presented overestimation in salt marsh elevation up to 0.25 m particularly in upstream areas of the Savannah River. When visually verifying the land cover classification, we identified a misclassified area at the upper left zone of Figure 3. This ‘Mixed and Evergreen Forest’ area located far away from the estuary was erroneously classified as emergent herbaceous wetland, which in turn led to high vertical errors (0.25 m) as shown Figure 4. Likewise, Fire Island showed maximum overestimation (up to 0.35 m) in marsh region along the barrier island. In contrast to the two estuarine systems, Fire Island has publicly available RTK data which in turn served to validate the performance of the DEM-correction tool.Figure 5a indicates that the mean elevation of zraw (~0.50 m) clearly overestimates the true mean RTK elevation (~0.25 m) by a factor of two. However, after linear adjustment through Equation (1), the adjusted mean elevation (~0.26 m) is almost identical to the ground-truth mean elevation. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that Equation (1) also modifies the natural spread of marsh elevation by narrowing its standard deviation. Likewise, extreme maximum and minimum values presented in Figure 5 and Table 8 might be outliers due to errors in RTK data collection and/or LiDAR sensors commonly used for DEM generation. In addition, Figure 5b and Table 8 suggest that the DEM-correction tool can effectively lead to identical ME, SE and RMSE when adjusting zraw with respect to RTK elevation data. Furthermore, we calculated the vertical error between zadj and RTK and observed that ME, SE and RMSE are in the order of mm. The latter suggests that the proposed tool can confidently be used for rapid and reliable assessment of LiDAR elevation error in coastal wetlands without any species-level classification. Although other studies suggest that distribution of vegetation height shows unique characteristics depending on the species analyzed [6,35], we assumed that RTK elevation data may follow a normal distribution provided that the entire emergent herbaceous wetland class is used in absence of accurate species-level classification (Figure 5). We therefore propose a methodology for elevation adjustment in wetlands that can easily be followed with readily available data (i.e., Landsat imagery of moderate resolution and DEMs) and high accuracy.", 4. Discussion,None,4
1027,"Adequate representation of salt marsh elevation in DEMs is necessary to conduct accurate studies in coastal ecosystems such as salt marsh restoration, local conservation and management of estuarine systems, storm surge attenuation and flood inundation mapping. In this study we propose a methodology that integrates remotely sensed data and machine learning with the 2016 NLCD to update emergent herbaceous wetlands in present-day (2019) imagery datasets. We combined OBIA and RF in land cover classification through a hierarchical approach at three nomenclature levels. We successfully trained the RF algorithm with a set of indices avoiding ‘noise’ from datasets with reflectance, spectral and textural properties different to emergent wetland regions. The hierarchical approach in addition to the hyperparameter tuning of the RF algorithm led to the highest accuracies (e.g., f1-score, Kappa coefficient and overall accuracy) in wetland regions, which in turn is promising and useful when (updated) land cover data is not available and/or field (ground-truth) data collection is hindered by extreme conditions or site-access difficulties.We used the updated emergent wetland regions to subsequently correct surface elevation of salt marsh ecosystems in Weeks Bay and Savannah Estuary. Our proposed automated method contains a DEM-correction tool in ArcGIS to generate a modified DEM based on the adjusted salt marsh elevation. We observed the largest overestimation in salt marsh elevation in Weeks Bay estuary with errors up to 0.50 m, which might influence the dynamics between coastal water level and wetlands in hydrodynamic models. The proposed tool can be modified and eventually applied to other bays and estuaries supporting different marsh vegetation species in emergent wetland regions. Based on RTK elevation validation in Fire Island, we argue that the learning database and methodology used to train the RF is adequate and robust enough to support the land cover classification we conducted without ‘ground truth’ validation in Weeks Bay and Savannah Estuary. Furthermore, the main goal of this study was to leverage the recent 2016 NLCD combined with present-day surface reflectance Landsat imagery.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
1028,"Seagrass provides a number of valuable ecosystem services in coastal areas, including primary production, biogenic habitat production, water filtering, wave energy attenuation, and sediment trapping [1,2]. In recent years, blue carbon, including seagrass meadows, has been acknowledged as an important service for climate change mitigation because of its value in the sequestration of carbon [3,4]. Seagrass meadows, however, have declined and degraded across most regions in the world, a change largely attributed to anthropogenic effects [5,6,7].The destruction of seagrass leads to the loss of various ecosystem services [7,8] and threatens the stability [6] and long-term livelihood of the fisherman in coastal areas [9,10]. Therefore, an accurate and rapid technique to inventory this resource is in high demand [5,11,12], to contribute baseline data for the evaluation of coastal ecosystem dynamics, establishment of marine protected areas, and functional zoning fitting to the local conditions. Where this can include a historic perspective, it can provide a comprehensive understanding of system change.Several attempts at mapping and monitoring seagrass meadows using different satellite sensors and approaches have been reported [12]. Change of seagrass cover has been assessed using RapidEye [13], Indian satellite image (IRS LISS IV) [14], WorldView-2, IKONOS, Quickbird-2 [15], and Landsat [16,17,18,19] in various parts of the globe including the Mediterranean, the USA, Australia, and Malaysia. The temporal range of these attempts is constrained by the various platform launch dates, and typically range from 5 to around 25 years. Few efforts have attempted a longer-term change detection (30–40 years) of seagrass, and accuracy assessment has not frequently been reported for such long-term change detection. The reasons for this may relate to a deficiency of ground-truth data against which to evaluate older satellite scenes, and a need for imagery for the development of robust models for the classification of seagrass meadows in variably submerged conditions to be captured at optimal times to allow traditional classification procedures to be applied.In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been emerging as an effective approach in various classification tasks, including for seagrass mapping [12,20]. ML provides improvements over the traditional Earth observation (EO) data classification approaches, to deal better with the challenges of mixed habitat, coarse spatial resolution of satellite imagery, and water column and atmospheric interference in coastal habitats [20,21,22]. Advantages of ML models are their use of non-parametric approaches, requiring no assumptions of normal distribution of input data, effective use of noisy data, and capability for multiple feature extraction [23,24,25,26]. The application of ML techniques to multitemporal satellite data, gathered from different satellite platforms, may therefore improve the overall accuracy of the classification result and enhance the reliability of seagrass change assessment. A range of different ensemble-based supervised classification techniques, such as boosting and bagging approaches [21,22,23,24], have been considered and tested in the literature for this type of task [27,28]. The most important differences between the bagging and boosting methods come from the approaches to the creation of training and testing datasets, and how the bagging and boosting methods deal with weak learners during the learning process [29,30]. Despite the potential for improved classification accuracy in suboptimal datasets, these approaches have not yet been fully implemented for seagrass change detection [12]. We are aware of only a single study, using Random Forest (RF) classification, for mapping the change of seagrass cover [13]. In the case study reported by these authors, the performance of the model was unstable and the accuracy varied among acquired scenes. Here we test the performance of a range of ML models, both boosting and bagging methods, with a time-series of satellite images, to compare their performances for assessment of seagrass cover and long-term change in Tauranga Harbour. Our goal is to improve the accuracy of tools for seagrass mapping and change detection. Landsat time-series data were selected for the current study as the longest available time series and as freely available satellite remotely sensed resources. Landsat has operated since 1972 and provides continuous, homogeneous input data up to the most current Landsat 8 operational land imager (OLI) in orbit [31]. The Landsat multitemporal data has been used previously for several long-term change detection tasks [12,32] with the combination of long-term acquisition, medium spatial resolution, and the high quality of atmosphere-corrected products cited as important attributes. The spatial resolution has been retained as 30 m through eight generations (Landsat 1–Landsat 8); however, the radiometric resolution has been improved from 8 bit to 12 bit, leading to a better recognition of surface objects [33]. In addition, Landsat imagery includes blue, green, and red wavebands, which are the most appropriate for underwater resource mapping [34,35,36], but have not yet been evaluated for long-term seagrass change detection [12]. Thus, our work attempts to fill a gap in the current literature by assessing the performance of historic Landsat imagery, coupled with various machine-learning boosting and bagging models implemented in an open-source environment, in mapping changes in seagrass extent in a tidally inundated environment.We employed two well-known models, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests (RF); and two novel techniques, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and CatBoost (CB) for the classification of seagrass meadows in Tauranga Harbour from Landsat imagery, and for detecting change across 29 years. The results demonstrated that the novel classification method CB was successful in describing the dynamics of change in seagrass in the study site as well as contributing baseline data for further assessment of change.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
1029,"We selected Tauranga Harbour (North Island, New Zealand) as the study site (Figure 1), due to its large size (201 km2 in surface area [37]), variation in water depth (from 0 m when exposed to 20 m in deep channels [38]), widely distributed but patchy seagrass cover and the availability of historic ground-truth information. The tidal regime is semidiurnal, with a range of 0.2–2.1 m, and the estuary has an average water residence time of 3–8 days [39]. Zostera muelleri is the only species of seagrass, occurring primarily in the intertidal parts of the harbor [20,37]. The growth rate of Z. muelleri is optimal at 12 practical salinity units (psu) [40] and 27–33 °C [41,42]. It attains its highest biomass in the austral summer and declines gradually over the winter, reaching a minimum cover in early spring [43]. Flowering and seed production of Z. muelleri is rare in New Zealand, reproduction is primarily vegetative and patch dynamics are correspondingly slow [44,45]. Seagrass is primarily intertidal in the estuary and, based on bathymetry and tidal predictions [38] at the time of the Landsat image acquisition, water depths ranged between 0.0–1.5 m in the locations where seagrass was present.In recent decades, Tauranga Harbour has been increasingly influenced by agricultural activities in the northern part (between 37.44° S and 37.54° S) and urban development in the southern part (between 37.62° S and 37.72° S). Episodic high loadings of sediment have been recorded and have resulted in the accumulation of sediment and high turbidity over the autumn and winter seasons [46,47]. Changes in the sedimentary environment have been implicated in negative impacts on the growth of seagrass [48,49], though other factors may also be involved. Available maps of seagrass in 1959, 1996, and 2011 derived from manual classification of aerial photography provided a resource for model validation [37].", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1.

1030,"Landsat images were downloaded from the GLOVIS website [50] for the years 1990, 2001, 2011, 2014, and 2019 (Table 1) at process level 1 (pixel value in digital number), and in the projection of WGS-84 UTM 60S. Landsat images were selected based on: (1) the acquired time of the Landsat image that coincided as closely as possible to low tide at the study site; (2) the image that had the lowest coverage of cloud; (3) whether there existed a similar acquisition month among the scenes. In practice, we selected scenes that ranged 1–2 months around March (Table 2).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Satellite Image Acquisition,2
1031,"A field survey was undertaken from 1–7 April 2019 (Figure 1) in the intertidal areas of the harbor. At low tide, the boundary of seagrass meadows was delimited using a Global Positioning System (GPS) Garmin Etrex 30 with an accuracy of ±2 m. Other substrata recorded during the field survey were bare sand and muddy sand. Macroalgae were neither detected from our field survey nor mentioned in previous mapping reports [37,51].Ground-Truth Points (GTPs), which were the base points to make the regions of interest (ROIs) for given classes, were recorded by following the boundary between seagrass meadows and non-vegetated areas. A total of 4315 GTPs were recorded for seagrass distribution, and 237 GTPs for other substrata in the harbor. ", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Field Survey Data ,2
1032,"Before 2019, no GTPs from field surveying were available, therefore we used aerial and Google Earth images (Table 2) and published documents [37,51] to identify regions of interests (ROIs), within which we were able to determine seagrass presence/absence with sufficient confidence to develop the models and to evaluate the accuracy of the hindcast seagrass maps. High-resolution aerial imagery exists from the years 2011 and 2014, and cloud-free, near-low-tide Landsat scenes, from February 2011 and March 2014, could be found that coincided with these. However, for the Landsat scenes in 1990 and 2001, aerial images were only available with a gap of 1–2 years. These included aerial images in 1991–1992 (monochrome and colour) and 2003 (colour). We found Google Earth images (identified as Landsat/Copernicus images in the Google Earth application) for both December 1990 and December 2001, which were in the austral summer and were close to the acquisition time of the Landsat scenes in April 1990 (austral autumn) and March 2001 (austral summer). Due to concerns over circularity of use of Landsat data, we used both Google Earth and aerial images to select the ROIs for Landsat scenes in 1990 and 2001, ensuring that ROIs were only used where both sources showed seagrass present. We considered that the slow dynamics of seagrass patches in Tauranga Harbour [44,45] made this approach robust.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Ground-Truth Historical Scenes,2
1033,"Our method of seagrass change detection using Landsat images involved four steps (Figure 2): (1) atmospheric correction, necessary to convert the pixel values from digital number to surface reflectance; (2) selection of the best ML technique by comparing the accuracies of classification models for 2019 data; (3) application of the selected ML model (from step 2) for seagrass mapping to Landsat images from 1990, 2001, 2011, and 2014; (4) identifying the changes of area and spatial distribution. Due to the deficiency of field data in the past, a binary classification (seagrass and non-seagrass) was adopted to deliver the most consistent change detection. 2.5.1. Atmospheric CorrectionAn atmospheric correction for all Landsat scenes was conducted using ACOLITE, in the PythonTM environment (Table A1, Appendix A) [52]. The original pixel values in physical digital number were converted to surface reflectance. Atmospheric corrected surface reflectance for pixels (limited by the study boundary, Figure 1) for the ρBlue (ρw482), the ρGeen (ρw561), and the ρRed (ρw654) bands were retained for all Landsat scenes in the years 1990, 2001, 2011, 2014, and 2019 for further processing steps. In the years 2014 and 2019, when Landsat 8 images were available, the coastal aerosol band (ρw443) was used, together with the ρBlue, ρGeen, and ρRed bands. The selected bands were used as independent variables in ML model prediction of the presence/absence of seagrass.Due to inconsistency between the tidal status and the acquisition time of Landsat images, our study site was considered to contain both exposed and submerged areas. Therefore, the near infrared (ρNIR) band, which attenuates rapidly in water, was not used in the analysis. A water column correction was not employed for water pixels in Tauranga Harbour, since the water depth and water optical characteristics (i.e., attenuation coefficient of the solar radiance in the water column) were unavailable for the historic scenes (1990, 2001, 2011). 2.5.2. Application of Machine-Learning Algorithms Hyper-Parameter Tuning for Selected Machine-Learning ModelsMachine-learning models comprise several hyperparameters (i.e., the parameters that control the learning process during the implementation of ML models), which often need to be optimized (i.e., by the process of tuning) to find the best combination to achieve best classification performance. The hyper-parameters of the RF, the SVM, the XGB, and the CB models were tuned using a grid search with threefold cross-validation in the scikit-learn library [53]. The hyperparameters for each of the models were maintained during the training and the testing phases (Table A2, Appendix A). Theoretical Background of the Machine-Learning Algorithms Used Random ForestsRandom Forests (RF) [54] is perhaps the most popular machine-learning model for both classification and regression problems in remote sensing [55]. It is an ensemble bagging method, which uses a bootstrap sampling approach to build the training and the testing data and a voting method to select the most accurate decision from a large group of input decision tress. The RF model is a nonparametric method that is insensitive to the data’s distribution, reducing the overfitting. The RF technique supplies various hyperparameters for tuning; however, the large number of parameters in the model results in slow optimization. Support Vector MachineSupport Vector Machine (SVM) [56,57] supports linear, poly-nominal, and radial basis function (RBF) kernels and can be adapted to various linear or non-linear data types. It has relatively few tunable hyperparameters but performance speed is still relatively slow when dealing with a large dataset. The SVM model uses a hyperplane to find the separation space among the classes with the most typical rules being: (i) better segregation of data; (ii) maximization of the distance between the closest data points and the hyperplane. Despite an accurate prediction and robustness to outliers, the SVM technique is not effective on overlaid classes or noisy datasets. Extreme Gradient BoostExtreme Gradient Boost (XGB) [17] is different from Gradient Boosting as it uses a more regularized model, which reduces over-fitting and results in a higher prediction accuracy. In the regularized gradient boosting mode, a selection of L1 or L2 regularization can be made to adapt the model to suit input data. Similar to other boosting models, the XGB technique supports various hyperparameters that are tuned using a grid search or genetic algorithm (GA) [58]. CatBoostCatBoost (CB) was introduced in 2018 [59] for classification, regression, and ranking tasks. It can handle both category and numerical data types. Using ordered boosting on decision trees, a permutation-driven derivation from classic boosting, the CB yields a fast and reliable performance, even with a small dataset. The model itself produces robust predictive results with default hyperparameters, reducing the requirement of tuning, and its novel gradient boosting scheme results in less overfitting. 2.5.3. Comparison of ML Algorithms for Seagrass Mapping Using the Landsat Image Taken in 2019Four ML models, SVM, RF, XGB, CB, were compared for seagrass mapping using the Landsat image from May 2019 and near-synchronous GTPs collected in April 2019 to identify the regions of interest (hereafter referred to as ROIs-2019) known to either seagrass or non-seagrass classes. The 1-month gap between the acquisition date of the Landsat image and the field survey date is acceptable due to the stable condition of the weather (i.e., no extreme weather phenomena) [60], and seagrass dynamics are slow in the study site [44,45]. A dataset of pixel reflectance values was extracted from ROIs-2019 and its corresponding Landsat image (dataset DS5, Table A3, Appendix A), split randomly into 60% for the training and 40% for the testing of selected ML models. The best model was selected as the model with highest accuracy and F1 score. 2.5.4. Seagrass Mapping Using Landsat Images in 1990, 2001, 2011, and 2014The best ML model identified using the 2019 data was applied for mapping of seagrass using Landsat images from 1990, 2001, 2011, and 2014 (see Table 1 for date acquisition and spatial resolution of satellite images). The hyper-parameters developed using the 2019 data were retained for subsequent analysis, while the year-specific model was developed using ROIs containing seagrass and non-seagrass classes from the relevant year. For the years 2011 and 2014, we created these ROIs using aerial imagery [61] (hereafter referred to as ROIs-2011 and ROIs-2014). For 1990 and 2001, we used Google Earth images cross-referenced with the aerial images acquired between 1991 and 1992 (for creating ROIs-1990) and 2003 (for creating ROIs-2001). A dataset of pixel reflectance values was extracted from corresponding Landsat images (dataset DS1, DS2, DS3, and DS4, Table A3, Appendix A) for ROIs-1990, ROIs-2001, ROIs-2011, and ROIs-2014. Datasets were split randomly into 60% for training of the classification and 40% for the accuracy assessment for 1990, 2001, 2011, and 2014. 2.5.5. Change DetectionChange detection was conducted using the standard confusion matrix tool in the SAGA GIS [62]. The confusion matrix analyzed the changes of the pairs of classified maps (years 1990–2011 and 1990–2019), reporting in the map as seagrass loss (seagrass to non-seagrass), seagrass recovery (non-seagrass to seagrass), and unchanging seagrass.

Despite a similar F1 score, the XGB model gained a higher precision than the RF technique.", 3. Results," 3.1.

1046,"The CB technique was then used to make classification maps for the years 1990, 2001, 2011, and 2014 (Figure 3). Our results indicated a performance across all metrics that was equivalent to that in the 2019 case, with accuracy and F1 scores over 95% for the binary classification of seagrass and nonseagrass (Table 5 and Table A4, Appendix A).The time series shows that the seagrass meadow area decreased from 2237 ha in 1990 to 1184 ha in 2019, though not monotonically (Figure 3 and Figure 4). A downward trend from 1990 (2237 ha) to 2001 (2035 ha), was followed by a recovery in 2011 (to 2380 ha), followed by a second decline to 1184 ha in 2019 (Figure 4a). Different trends, though all with an overall decline to 2019, were discovered in the northern (Figure 4b), the central (Figure 4c), and the southern (Figure 4d) harbor. Seagrass attained the largest area in the central harbor, where it reached the peak of 1985 ha in 2011; however, it declined to 776 ha in 2019. In the northern harbor, seagrass was very abundant in 1990 with 549 ha, but strongly decreased to only 92 ha in 2001. This number increased to 242 ha in 2014 before suffered a second decline to 148 ha in 2019. Seagrass loss was also recorded in the southern harbor, at a slower rate of degradation, dropping from 576 ha in 1990 to 222 ha in 2011, and around 260 ha in 2019. Across the entire harbor, the recovery in 2011 was due to a large increase of seagrass areas from 2001 in the northern and the central harbors.The distribution of seagrass has also changed over time. In 1990, the meadows were similarly abundant in the northern, central, and southern harbors. Declines to 2001 mostly reflected losses from the northern and southern meadows, while the central meadows remained and were responsible for most of the expansion between 2001 and 2011 (Figure 3 and Figure 5). After 2011, there was no detectable recovery of the northern or the southern meadows, and the renewed overall decline was due to degradation of the central meadows, declining in area and becoming patchier by 2019 (Figure 3 and Figure 5).", 3.

1047,"In this investigation, we have demonstrated the use of machine-learning approaches successfully to classify seagrass in Landsat images of Tauranga Harbour, and to use this classification to detect changes in seagrass cover over a period of 29 years. Due to the relative paucity of field validation data from most of the time series of this analysis, we only tested a binary classification (seagrass and non-seagrass classes), but the four machine-learning models, RF, XGB, SVM, and CB, were all capable of detecting seagrass from other bottom types with high precision and recall scores. Previously, the RF and the SVM models have been tested for seagrass classification [65] and the RF for seagrass change detection in the Mediterranean [13]. These previous attempts have produced accuracies from 76–98% for Posidonia oceania [13,65] and 32–62% for Cymodocea nodosa using higher resolution RapidEye imagery [13], both lower than were achieved in this study using the CB technique. P. oceania and C. nodosa are structurally similar to Z. muelleri and would seem likely to offer a similar target. This suggests that the use of the state-of-the-art ML models with optimized hyper-parameters is an important factor contributing to the high-precision classification of seagrass presence/absence. Both the XGB and the CB techniques have been proven as potential candidates for a range of classification [58,66,67,68], and regression [69,70,71] problems but have not previously been applied to seagrasses, or to any other semi-submerged targets, so it is not clear if this is a general performance advantage in this type of application.Other advantages over previous studies may, however, exist in Tauranga Harbour. Specifically, Z. muelleri occurs as monospecific meadows, without a substantial presence of macroalgae, which can degrade classifications [20,37], and where the reflectance value of seagrass is considerably different from the other common bottom types (sand, muddy sand, deep water). In addition, we were able to use cloud-free Landsat scenes, with atmospheric correction using ACOLITE, which has been designed for the aquatic application of Landsat imagery, which likely reduced the uncertainty of atmospheric impact and derived a higher quality of corrected surface reflectance [72].In this study, the two boosting techniques (XGB, CB) and the one bagging (RF) outperformed the more traditional SVM methods. The SVM model does not work well with noisy data, where unclear margins exist between classes [73]. Such fuzzy margins were observed at the study site at the overlap between seagrass and non-seagrass (sand, muddy sand) classes, where the distinction between present and absent was gradual. This likely resulted in the relatively poor performance of the SVM model. The boosting techniques XGB (0.93) and CB (0.94) show slightly higher precision than the bagging RF (0.92), which might have resulted from the advancement in decision-tree growth of the boosting techniques. Unlike the RF model, which builds the independent decision tree from the bootstrapped samples, the boosting XGB and CB models sequentially grow new trees using the residual information of previous trees, which allows the new learner to solve the errors of the previous tree by minimizing the residual of the next model fitting. For a final prediction of a classification task, the bagging RF takes a majority vote from all decision trees while a weighted majority vote is adapted to the boosting techniques, such as XGB and CB, and potentially results in a higher precision of a class prediction.Given the classification skill metrics, the CB is the best candidate for the mapping and change detection of seagrass in the study site. The CB is also amongst the latest emerging algorithms developed in the computer vision and pattern recognition fields (released in 2018); is easy to tune with fewer hyperparameters than the RF and the XGB techniques; and is using symmetric trees, which potentially results in faster optimization and prediction [59]. The CB model differs from the boosting algorithm family by using ordered boosting on a random permutation of given dataset, which prevent the prediction shift and alleviate the overfitting in model prediction. The outperformance of the CB over other ML models has been reported for mangrove total carbon estimation [74], various testing datasets [59], and forest aboveground biomass [75], which confirm the reliability and the capability of the CB implementation for seagrass mapping in our study. Our accurate long-term (29-year) change detection of seagrass meadows using the CB machine-learning model in Tauranga Harbour is a significant advance in the classification and monitoring of seagrass ecosystem using multispectral, remotely sensed data.Our analysis has confirmed a general declining trend of seagrass cover in Tauranga Harbour reported previously [37] using aerial photography. In absolute terms, Park (2011) reported 2744 ha in March 2011, close to our estimate of 2380 ha at that time. Also, like Park, our analysis was able to resolve areas within the estuary where the greatest loss has occurred between assessments. We specifically noted that the seagrass loss was initially focused in the northern and southern parts of the harbor. High flux of sediment was recorded into the northern part, due to agricultural intensification, and the southern part, due to urban development, particularly after 2011 [47] and may explain the long-term decline of seagrass in those areas. The potential impact of agricultural and urban developments in the northern and the southern parts is supported by the observation that recovery was only observed in the central part of the harbor (Figure 3, year 2011, and Figure 5). Another potential factor contributing to long-term loss of seagrass is the grazing of black swans, which has previously been linked to variations in seagrass cover in the southern harbor [37,76]. Further analysis is required to develop a detailed explanation on the dynamics of seagrass meadows in Tauranga Harbour.Here, we advocate the use of novel and advanced ML models, in combination with multitemporal Landsat images to obtain a long-term, historic series of observations on seagrass dynamics that will continue to be supported into the future through ongoing developments of the Landsat series. The proposed method potentially provides a low-cost, high-precision classification tool that can be extended to other estuaries with similar target conditions. While aerial photography and very high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite images have higher spatial resolution than Landsat images, they come at a high cost, and spatial coverage can be limited. Currently, Landsat is the most suitable satellite image resource for any long-term change detection due to its long time in service. A 30 m spatial resolution was found suitable to support a binary classification of seagrass in this study, and accuracy was unaffected by the small changes in spectral information that have accompanied the incremental changes in Landsat optical sensors. The most recent generation Landsat 8, with an improvement in radiometric resolution up to 16 bit (in the level 1 product), compared to the 8 bit in previous generations, and the addition of a coastal aerosol band, has good potential for accurate detection of the dynamics of seagrass. An improvement of spectral and radiometric resolution in Landsat 9 (scheduled for launching in 2021) is expected to provide continuity into the future monitoring of seagrass [77]. For a short-term observation of seagrass change, our proposed methods for seagrass classification are also potentially applicable to a wide range of VHR images (Quickbird, Ikonos, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)) with consideration of the trade-off among the spatial coverage of the study site, the spatial resolution of the image, and the available budget.The open-source approach is another significant advantage of our proposed methodology. The Python environment provides an excellent option for the end users to apply the novel machine-learning algorithms and remote-sensing data processing platform to support accurate mapping and estimation of the blue carbon budget of seagrass ecosystem [78]. Most commercial software only provides a limited number of processing and classification algorithms, with few, older ML options (e.g., SVM) and has a high license cost. Our proposed methods are more flexible, free of charge, and offer a high efficiency for mapping the dynamics of seagrass meadows in the complex coastal marine environment.Despite a successful application of the CB model for seagrass classification and change detection, this research still comes with limitations. Since we used a supervised classification technique, both classification and validation require an independent assessment of seagrass cover in at least part of the remote image, to provide the ROIs that allow the training and validation steps. In addition, the seasonal growth of seagrass in temperate waters, and its intertidal habit, raise the uncertainty of change detection between various time points unless imagery is available at the same time, and under similar tidal conditions. The offset between Landsat, the time of image acquisition, and tidal regime (Table 1) is unavoidable in the study site; however, we consider that it is unlikely to significantly impact on classification accuracy. In Tauranga Harbour, seagrass meadows are distributed in the intertidal regions at a water depth ranging from 0 m (exposed) to a maximum of 1.5 m (at high tide) [37,51]. The ρBlue, ρGreen, and ρRed bands have nominal maximum penetration depths of 15, 10, 5 m respectively [34], and while moderate, but variable, coastal turbidity in the harbor will increase attenuation rate, the maximum immersion depth of 1.5 m suggests that the spectral bands reflectance signatures are highly likely to have been impacted by seagrass. Average vertical attenuation rate of the downwelling radiation within the 400–700 nm band in Tauranga Harbour is 0.40 m−1 (range 0.16–0.98 m−1) [79] and these authors found that 65% of incident radiation reached the estuary floor at 1.2 m depth. Again, this suggests that water clarity is sufficient to ensure that, even at maximum water depth, seagrass will contribute to the reflectance spectrum detected by the satellite. As with all satellite-based remote sensing, a cloud-free view is required, which constrains use of this technology.To compensate for the limitation, we attempted to select all Landsat images acquired in the growing season of seagrass in Tauranga Harbour (austral summer and autumn) and at low tide, but this further constrains the availability of verifiable Landsat imagery for seagrass cover estimation. Further research focusing on expanding the novel approach used in the current study for long-term change detection of seagrass meadows is underway.", 4. Discussion,None,4
1048,"In this research, we used the novel machine-learning model CatBoost (CB) and other well-known ML models (RF, SVM, and XGB) for seagrass cover classification (present/absent), using Landsat satellite imagery, in Tauranga Harbour, New Zealand. Our results showed a high level of accuracy for all approaches, but the CB model outperformed the other selected models, with precision, recall, and F1 scores of 0.94, 0.96, and 0.95 respectively.We then applied the CB technique to multispectral Landsat data for the detection of change in seagrass cover over a 29-year period between 1990 and 2019 in Tauranga Harbour. The change detection analysis determined an overarching declining trend of seagrass cover in Tauranga Harbour with approximately 50% loss over the 29 years period (from 2237 ha in 1990 to 1184 ha in 2019); these results concurred with a study using aerial imaging. Seagrass was lost in the far northern and southern areas of the harbor during the first part of this time, then more gradually from the central region. This analysis of change using Landsat images combined with the CB model demonstrates the value of historic satellite imagery and machine-learning for accurate documentation of the change over time in this difficult-to-quantify coastal vegetation.", 5.

1049,"Airborne laser scanning (ALS) has become an important source of auxiliary data for estimating tree heights, diameter distribution, timber volume, and forest biomass [1,2]. For forest inventory purposes, the ALS data are often applied within an estimation framework known as the area-based approach. In this method, introduced in Næsset [3] and further described in Næsset [4], models are constructed using spatially coincident observations of ground-based response values (e.g., biomass) measured on field plots and variables derived from ALS data. The models are subsequently used to predict forest attributes for individual cells which tessellate the area of interest (AOI). The cell predictions are finally aggregated to estimates for the entire AOI or regions within the AOI.Hollaus et al. [5] and Hollaus et al. [6] described three main approaches to modelling the relationship between forest attributes and the remotely sensed data: physical, empirical, and semi-empirical. While physical modelling approaches have had limited practical applications due to difficulties with inverting the models [5], both the empirical and semi-empirical approaches are commonly used. Following the empirical approach, a variety of features are extracted from the ALS echoes and related to field-based observations using statistical methods such as regression analysis, nearest neighbors, neural networks, or ensemble learning to model the relationship (e.g., [7,8,9,10]). Universal for these methods when used in the empirical approach is that the model selection is performed objectively. One of the most common methods, at least the most frequently implemented method in commercial operations in Norway, is ordinary least square regression (OLS). To improve the linear relationship between the response and predictors, transformations of the response or of both the response and predictors are often used. Two common transformation approaches are the square-root transformation (SQRT) of the response, and the logarithmic transformation (LOG) of both response and predictors. Comparisons of SQRT and LOG models generally show small differences in terms of model performance. Næsset [11], for instance, reported only small differences in model performance when modelling aboveground biomass (AGB) in young forests in Norway using SQRT, LOG, and linear model forms. Saarela et al. [12] found that SQRT models performed slightly better compared to linear and LOG models when using ALS data to model timber volumes in Finland. The use of SQRT and LOG transformations requires that model predictions are back-transformed to original scale. Although different methods of back-transformation of LOG models have been suggested (e.g., [13,14,15]), achieving unbiasedness is challenging [16]. For back-transformation of SQRT models, the commonly applied correction factor presented by Gregoire et al. [17] results in “negligibly small” biased predictions. Regression methods that render the need for transformation of the response obsolete have also been used e.g., OLS without transformation of the response [11], quadratic polynomials [18], nonlinear least square (NLS) [19], and generalized linear modelling (GLM) [20]. These methods have however not reached the same level of use in operational settings as the LOG and SQRT. This could be because of reported advantages with the LOG and SQRT methods, or with difficulties in applying the alternative methods.Although less used in operational settings, the semi-empirical approach is common in research of the relationship between forest attributes and ALS-derived predictors (e.g., [5,21,22,23]). Following this approach, the model form and predictors are selected a priori, often based on the theoretical relationship between the response and predictor or predictors. Allometry of tree height and girth is often described by a power model [24,25] and is therefore commonly applied to model AGB, substituting tree height with ALS-derived variables and girth with AGB. This approach was taken by Asner, et al. [23] to model forest AGB on the island of Hawaii. The authors regressed AGB against mean canopy height derived from the ALS data using a NLS modelling procedure. Asner et al. [26] advocated the same approach following the argument of a theoretical relationship between mean canopy height and carbon stored in the AGB. Having only one predictor variable, this approach makes it easy to fit the NLS model using statistical software such as e.g., R [27]. Increasing the number of predictors makes it increasingly difficult to fit the model. Although Magnussen et al. [21] used two predictors, other authors have used OLS and LOG transformations to achieve the desired model form (e.g., [22,28]). The variables were however selected subjectively making the approach semi-empirical. Bouvier et al. [22] selected four predictor variables based on their theoretical complimentary properties describing the canopy height, heterogeneity of canopy height, canopy cover, and variation in leaf area density. Tompalski et al. [28] took a similar approach, however selecting the most correlated ALS-derived variable to each of the four model properties. Chen [29] modelled AGB in three different study sites in northwestern USA. He compared two power models, each with one predictor variable, one multiple OLS model with a logarithmic transformed response and three pre-selected predictors, and two nonparametric methods. Results showed that the power model with the mean of all ALS echoes as predictor had the smallest estimated prediction error in two of the study sites, whilst the multiple OLS model form with three variables had the smallest estimated prediction errors in one study site.Although the empirical approach has been successful and is currently used by commercial companies in many operational applications [30], the method has its limitations. In the presence of a large number of candidate predictors, with many of them being strongly correlated, there is a potential risk of multicollinearity problems that complicates the selection of model predictors [31] (Chapter 7). Furthermore, the empirical models are to some degree often affected by local effects such as geographical region, forest type, ALS acquisition parameters, and forest inventory design [5]. In this context, the semi-empirical approach has the advantage of simplifying the modelling step and enabling the re-use and re-calibration of the models with new ALS data [21].The use of predictive models for supporting forest inventories is traditionally done within either a design-based or a model-based inferential framework. Even though the design-based framework has been predominant, the case for the model-based framework is now being made [32]. One of the main advantages of the model-based framework is that it does not, as opposed to design-based, rely on a probabilistic field sample. Instead, the inference is based on the model as a valid model for the distribution of 



Y
i



 random variables. The sampled values 



y
i



 are considered as a realization of the model [33] (p. 40). The model cannot be observed, but the parameters of the model can be estimated from the sample. Furthermore, the model-based framework provides more flexibility in terms of model transferability and small area estimation [32]. The variability of the predictive model can be evaluated by the mean square error (MSE). However, when used within the model-based inferential framework, the error of estimates for predictive models with small MSE can be larger compared to other candidate models that are nearly as good as the best one according to the MSE criterion (e.g., [12]). Evaluation of predictive models within the model-based inferential framework can instead be assessed in terms of (1) model specification to ensure that the model is correctly specified and (2) a model-based variance estimate (e.g., [34]). In order to evaluate the errors of predictive models, we studied a criterion that incorporates both a cross-validated MSE (i.e., mean square difference (MSD)) and a model-based variance estimate. The proposed evaluation criterion is referred to as the model error (ME).While both the empirical and semi-empirical modelling approaches are used for AGB estimation, to the best of our knowledge, only the study by Hollaus et al. [5] has attempted to compare the two alternatives. The study by Hollaus et al. [5] found that the two approaches resulted in similar accuracy, and advocated the use of the semi-empirical approach based on its simplicity. Because the two approaches are commonly used, and with little scientific basis for choosing one over the other, it is of interest to assess possible differences in performance. It is also of interest to generalize the choice of approach, and the diverse data available for this study provided an opportunity for such generalizations.The main objective of the present study was therefore to compare the two approaches in a variety of biomes. We used both MSD and ME as model evaluation criteria, and compared the performance of two empirical and two semi-empirical modelling approaches. The analyses were performed on five datasets representing four different forest biomes: tropical moist and -dry, temperate, and boreal forests.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
1050,"Data from five study sites from four different forest biomes were used in the present study (Table 1). These datasets containing 1182 field plots in total allowed for an extensive comparison of both the empirical and semi-empirical approaches.The first dataset (S1) was collected in Amani Nature Reserve, northeastern Tanzania (5°08′ S, 38°37′ E). It represents a tropical moist forest biome. The area receives around 2000 mm rainfall per year, and most of the rain falls in the two wet seasons, April–May and October–November. Daily mean temperatures vary from about 16 to 25 °C. The area is covered by both old-growth natural tropical forest with a multi-layered canopy and previously harvested areas with single layered, light demanding, pioneer species. Forest inventory data such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), and tree species were collected on 153 rectangular plots of about 50 m × 20 m in size over a period of four years, 2008–2012 [35]. The horizontal area of the plots varies from 639 to 1239 m2, with a mean of 914 m2 (Table 1). The variation in plot size is due to the procedure of plot establishment where the plots were laid out along the terrain slope, without slope correction. A threshold of ≥10 cm was used for recording the DBH. The corner coordinates of each plot were established by means of differential global navigation satellite system (GNSS), using survey-grade receivers. Errors in the x–y coordinates of the plot corners were estimated to an average of 0.57 m based on random errors reported from the post-processing software [36] and empirical experience of the relationship between reported error and the true error documented by Næsset [37]. H was measured using Vertex IV hypsometer and a DBH-H model [35] (Equation (1)) was developed from the sample trees with height measurements collected on each plot and used to predict the H of all trees. AGB predicted for each individual tree in the sample was obtained using a local AGB model with DBH and H as independent variables [38] (p. 43). Further details about the field data can be found in Hansen et al. [35].The second dataset (S2) was collected in a tropical dry forest during 2011 and the first quarter of 2012 [39]. The site is located in Liwale district (9°54′ S, 37°38′ E), southeastern Tanzania, and it is characterized by a climate with two rain seasons during November–January and March–May. The mean annual rainfall ranges between 600 and 1000 mm, and daily mean temperatures range between 20 and 30 °C. The forest structure has high diversity both in terms of structure because of varying soil conditions as well as a high species diversity. Dominant species included Brachystegia sp., Julbernadia sp., and Pterocarpus angolensis. Field plots were laid out in a clustered design as part of Tanzania’s National Forestry Resources Monitoring and Assessment (NAFORMA) program [40]. To avoid problems with spatial auto-correlation, we selected the two plots farthest away from each other from each cluster for the present study. The minimum distance between plots was 905 m, and the average distance within a cluster was 1438 m. The semi-variance of predicted wood volume studied during the design of the NAFORMA sample survey is indicated to level off at a distance of around 250 m for most of the forest types in Tanzania [41]. Wood volume and AGB are strongly correlated variables. To test for an effect of the clustering, a log-likelihood ratio test between GLM models with and without a compound symmetry covariance structure that should account for heteroscedasticity was performed. The models were fit using maximum likelihood using the “nlme” [42] package in R [27]. The test showed no significant cluster effect. Collection of forest inventory data was performed on concentric circular plots of 1, 5, 10, and 15 m in radius, following the field protocol of NAFORMA [43]. Minimum thresholds for DBH for registration on the concentric plots were ≥1, ≥5, ≥10, and ≥20 cm respectively. The center coordinate of each plot was established with the same equipment and procedure as in the first dataset. Errors in the x–y coordinates of the plot corners were estimated to an average of 0.19 m [39]. The height of every fifth three was measured using a Suunto hypsometer and DBH-H models were developed for each stratum. These DBH-H models were used to predict the H of all trees. Tree AGB was predicted using allometric models developed for Tanzanian woodlands by Mugasha et al. [44]. Further details about the field data can be found in Mauya et al. [39].The third dataset (S3) was collected in a temperate forest in the Czech Republic during January, July, and August of 2015 [45]. The study site was located in Mendel University Training Forest, Křtiny (49°17′ N, 16°44′ E). Mean annual rainfall is 600 mm and mean annual temperature is 7.5 °C. Tree species composition can be described as coniferous dominant with Picea abies, Larix decidua, and Pinus sylvestris making up 76%, 4%, and 2% of the trees, respectively. The rest of the trees are Fagus sylvatica (17%) and other species (2%). The canopy is generally closed and with only one layer. Forest inventory data were collected on 50 circular plots with radius 12.62 m. The plots were selected by stratified sampling using an existing forest management plan. Plot centers were determined by GNSS using Topcon Hiper Pro with applied RTK corrections from the CZEPOS (Czech Positioning System) reference network. GNSS measurements were performed at five-second intervals for at least 20 minutes. On each plot, DBH and H of all trees above a minimum DBH ≥7 cm were measured. H was measured using a Vertex laser hypsometer. The age of forest stands was in the range of 60–130 years. Tree specific AGB was calculated using allometric models (Alnus glunitosa, Fagus sylvatica, Picea abies, and Pseudotsuga menziesii [46]; Pinus sylvestris and Abies alba [47]; Larix decidua [48]).The fourth dataset (S4) was collected in a boreal forest located in Aurskog-Høland municipality (59°50′ N, 11°30′ E), southeastern Norway, during the fall of 2006 [49]. Conifers (Picea abies and Pinus sylvestris) dominate the forest. Some deciduous species are also present, mainly Betula pubescens, especially in younger stands. A total of 201 circular field plots of 200 m2 in size were systematically distributed. Plot centers were determined by GNSS using Topcon LegacyE receivers observing pseudo-range and carrier phase of the global positioning system and global navigation satellite system. All trees on the field plots with DBH ≥4 cm were callipered and DBH was recorded in two cm diameter classes. An average of nine trees per plot were sampled for height measurement with a probability proportional to stem basal area. H was measured with a Vertex hypsometer. Volume of each sample tree was estimated by means of species-specific volume models of individual trees dependent on DBH and H [50,51,52]. A so-called tariff height for each tree on the plot using tariff height curves [53]. For trees with a field measured H and an H estimated from the tariff height curves, separate volumes were estimated using both heights. The ratio between the mean volume predicted from field measurements and the volume for the sample trees was then used to adjust the volumes of all trees. Using the ratio estimated volumes, H were predicted for trees without a field measured H using single tree volume models [50,51,52]. Trees with DBH <5 cm and H >1.3 m were counted and their H estimated by means of models presented by Tomter [54]. AGB of each component; stump, stem, bark, dead and living branches, and foliage of each tree was calculated using species-specific allometric models developed by Marklund [55] with DBH and field measured or predicted H as independent variables.The fifth dataset (S5) was collected in Hedmark county (61°40′ N, 11°40′ E) during 2005–2007 [56] as part of the Norwegian national forest inventory. A total of 648 circular field plots of 250 m2 in size were systematically distributed. Plot centers were determined by GNSS using Topcon LegacyE receivers observing pseudo-range and carrier phase of the global positioning system and global navigation satellite system for a minimum of 15 min. Forest conditions and dominant species in S5 are relatively similar to the forest in S4. The AGB density, however, is considerably lower (Table 1). All trees on the field plots with DBH ≥5 cm were callipered. An average of ten trees per plot were sampled for height measurement with a probability proportional to stem basal area. H was measured with a Vertex hypsometer. AGB for trees with DBH ≥5 cm was estimated using the same procedure as in S4. Trees with DBH <5 cm and H >1.3 m were counted and their H estimated by means of models presented by Tomter [54]. The original dataset covered both forest and non-forest areas. In the present study, only plots with registered AGB were used.For all datasets, the AGB predictions of individual trees were summed for each plot and expanded to per hectare unit (Table 1).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Field Data,2
1051,"The ALS datasets were acquired at different times and with different sensors and acquisition parameters. The acquisition parameters are summarized in Table 2. Post flight processing of the ALS data was performed using the TerraScan software (Terrasolid Ltd., Helsinki, Finland) [57]. A triangulated irregular network (TIN) surface was constructed using the algorithm presented by Axelsson [58]. Following the construction of the TIN, the elevation of each ALS echo relative to the TIN was computed, resulting in an elevation above the ground surface for each echo.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. ALS Data Acquisition and Initial Processing,2
1052,"The Leica ALS70 sensors provided records of up to five echoes per pulse and the Optech ALTM 3100 sensor four echoes. In the present study, we categorized each echo as “single”, “first of many”, “intermediate”, or “last of many” based on the echo sequence. The “single” and “first of many” echoes were combined into one dataset and denoted as “first” while “single” and “last of many” were combined into another dataset and denoted as “last”. The separation of “first” and “last” echoes were based on the assumption that the echoes from a pulse that has already been intercepted by the canopy (“last”) provide divergent information from the echoes not previously intercepted (“first”), and is a common procedure for processing ALS data [59]. Predictor variables were derived from the vertical distribution of echoes for each plot. The variables used in the empirical approach included percentiles of echo elevation, relative canopy density, and mean (

). These variables were calculated using a canopy threshold of 1.3 m, frequently used to eliminate echoes from undergrowth and rocks. Canopy density was computed by dividing the height from the canopy threshold to the 95th percentile height into ten equal intervals as recommended by Næsset and Gobakken [60]. Cumulative proportions of echoes in the ten intervals to total number of echoes were calculated (

). Height percentiles and canopy density variables were calculated from the “first” and “last” data separately.Studies following a semi-empirical approach have often used only one [5,26] or two [3,21] ALS-derived variables to model AGB or timber volumes. A variable capturing both the height and density of the canopy is often used. By calculating the height of ALS echoes without a canopy threshold, the height variables describe both the height and density of the canopy. Hollaus et al. [5] used a variable derived from “first” echoes only for modelling timber volumes in Austria, whereas others have used both a variable from all echoes [26] and a variable from first echoes [61] to model AGB in tropical biomes. Næsset [3] used the mean height of all echoes together with a canopy density variable to model timber volumes in eastern Norway. Furthermore, Magnussen et al. [21] found that complementing the canopy height of “first” echoes with a measure for the variance in canopy height reduced the RMSE with 11% when modelling timber volumes in eastern Norway. For simplistic reasons, and the ability to compute the heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator described in Section 2.4.4, we chose to explore the approach used by e.g., Asner et al. [26] and Asner and Mascaro [61]. We therefore derived two variables from the ALS data to be used in the semi-empirical approach. Although the calculations are not identical, we use the terms of Asner et al. [26] and derived the mean canopy height (MCH) from all ALS echoes and the top canopy height (TCH) from ALS echoes in the “first” dataset.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. ALS-Derived Predictor Variables,2
1053,"As described in the introduction, there exists a number of statistical methods which have been used in both empirical and semi-empirical approaches. We have chosen two common approaches in operational settings and research i.e., OLS used in the empirical approach (described in Section 2.4.1), and NLS used in the semi-empirical approach (described in Section 2.4.2). 2.4.1. Ordinary Least Square ModellingMultiple regression models expressed as LOG functions are frequently used for estimating AGB with ALS data in the empirical approach (e.g., [60,62]). Another common transformation used for predictive AGB models is the SQRT (e.g., [11,12]). Both transformations are applied to improve the linear relationship between the response and the predictors and to mitigate heteroscedasticity in the models. Thus, the models used for the empirical approach were formulated as:

. Selection of predictor variables was performed using a best subset regression procedure implemented in the “leaps” package [63] in R, constrained to include a maximum of three predictors in the models. To avoid overfitting and multicollinearity, the models were selected using the Bayesian information criterion and variance inflation factors were kept below 10. Models without cross validation (see Section 2.4.3) were reported for assessing selected predictors.Transformation of the response introduce a bias when the predicted biomass is back-transformed to arithmetic scale. To correct for bias in the LOG models, the correction factor for the uniform minimum variance unbiased estimator [14] was applied. Initial bias correction showed that the correction factor presented by Bradu and Mundlak [14] gave significant bias (p > 0.05) at two study sites (S2 and S5). Thus, a correction factor presented by Snowdon [13] was applied for predictions in S2 and S5. SQRT models were back-transformed according to Gregoire et al. [17]. In the present study, one LOG (Equation (1)) and one SQRT (Equation (2)) model was fit for each study site. These are referred to as OLSLOG and OLSSQRT, respectively. 2.4.2. Nonlinear RegressionInstead of relying on transformations and multiple variables, the choice of modelling technique in the semi-empirical approach is often to use NLS. The use of the NLS technique enables the model to be fitted non-linearly through successive approximations by which only initial starting values for the approximation have to be stated [64] (Chapter 8). With several parameters to be estimated, the selection of starting values becomes difficult. Taking the semi-empirical approach with only one predictor, selection of starting values is simplified. We fit two nonlinear power models using the standard “nls” procedure in R with models formulated as:

Successful use of the MSD as a model criterion assumes a design-based estimation strategy as the criterion is based on the observations and predictions on the sample units. We therefore sought to construct a model evaluation criterion that could be more informative than the MSE in cases where the field sample is not a probability sample. This was done by incorporating a model-based variance estimate based on a 10-fold cross validation. This criterion is referred to as the model error (ME, Equation (5)). The ME criterion combines both an expression of the MSD (Equation (5), first term) and a model-based variance estimate (Equation (5), second term):

In the case of AGB modelling however, the variance of the response is likely to be related to the mean of the response, and thus we often have heteroscedasticity in our regression models. In this case, Long and Ervin [65] recommended using a heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix. OLS models with significant (p < 0.05) heteroscedasticity were identified using the Breusch–Pagan test [66]. Residual plots were used to visually assess heteroscedasticity in the NLS models. In the presence of heteroscedasticity, heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimators were used as estimators of

. For the OLS models, heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimators of type HC3, presented by MacKinnon and White [67], were computed using the “sandwich” package [68] in R. The HC3 (Equation (8)) estimator is frequently used and recommended for small samples [65]. Computation of the HC3 estimator requires the model projection matrix. Since this is not available for NLS models, a nonlinear heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator described by White [69] (p. 821) was therefore adopted for a nonlinear heteroscedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator (NHC), Equation (9). The nonlinear NHC estimator was implemented in R and used to compute the final variance estimate in the presence of heteroscedasticity:

Another common transformation used for predictive AGB models is the SQRT (e.g., [11,12]). Both transformations are applied to improve the linear relationship between the response and the predictors and to mitigate heteroscedasticity in the models.

. Selection of predictor variables was performed using a best subset regression procedure implemented in the “leaps” package [63] in R, constrained to include a maximum of three predictors in the models. To avoid overfitting and multicollinearity, the models were selected using the Bayesian information criterion and variance inflation factors were kept below 10. Models without cross validation (see Section 2.4.3) were reported for assessing selected predictors.Transformation of the response introduce a bias when the predicted biomass is back-transformed to arithmetic scale. To correct for bias in the LOG models, the correction factor for the uniform minimum variance unbiased estimator [14] was applied. Initial bias correction showed that the correction factor presented by Bradu and Mundlak [14] gave significant bias (p > 0.05) at two study sites (S2 and S5). Thus, a correction factor presented by Snowdon [13] was applied for predictions in S2 and S5. SQRT models were back-transformed according to Gregoire et al. [17]. In the present study, one LOG (Equation (1)) and one SQRT (Equation (2)) model was fit for each study site. These are referred to as OLSLOG and OLSSQRT, respectively.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4.1. Ordinary Least Square Modelling,2
1055,"Instead of relying on transformations and multiple variables, the choice of modelling technique in the semi-empirical approach is often to use NLS. The use of the NLS technique enables the model to be fitted non-linearly through successive approximations by which only initial starting values for the approximation have to be stated [64] (Chapter 8). With several parameters to be estimated, the selection of starting values becomes difficult. Taking the semi-empirical approach with only one predictor, selection of starting values is simplified.

This was done by incorporating a model-based variance estimate based on a 10-fold cross validation. This criterion is referred to as the model error (ME, Equation (5)).

1058,"Two OLS models and two NLS models were fit separately for the five study sites. The empirical approach was assessed by the two OLS models formulated as one LOG and one SQRT model, referred to as OLSLOG and OLSSQRT respectively. Models for the five study sites, fit using all observations, were reported for reference (see Supplementary Table S1). The semi-empirical approach was assessed in terms of the two NLS models with MCH and TCH as predictor variables, referred to as NLSMCH and NLSTCH respectively. Comparison of the model performances showed that the empirical approach resulted in the smallest MSD in three of the five study sites (Figure 1). In S1, S3 and S5, the empirical approach with a SQRT model resulted in the smallest MSD. In S3, the semi-empirical (NLSTCH) and empirical (OLSSQRT) approaches were almost equal in terms of MSD, with the OLSSQRT resulting in slightly smaller MSD. In terms of model-based estimated variance (Figure 2), the empirical approach resulted in the smallest variance estimates in four of the five study sites. In S1, the NLSMCH resulted in the smallest variance estimate. Considering the ME, the empirical approach had smaller ME in three of five study sites (Figure 3). In the two tropical study sites (S1 and S2), the NLSMCH model produced a smaller ME estimate compared to the other models. The scatterplot in Figure 4 provides additional information on the ME criterion. For sites S1, S2, S3, and S5, the first term of Equation (4) (i.e., an expression of MSD) was smallest for the NLS models. The second term of Equation (4) (i.e., estimated variance) however was larger, and the OLS models resulted in smaller ME for S3, S4, and S5.When comparing the two different transformation strategies in the empirical approach, the OLSSQRT models resulted in smaller MSD in all study sites (Figure 1). It also resulted in smaller ME in all study sites, compared to LOG models (Figure 3). For the two NLS modelling approaches, NLSMCH resulted in smaller MSD and ME values in all study sites except S3 where the NLSTCH resulted in the smallest values of MSD and ME.", 3. Results,None,3
1059,"Both empirical and semi-empirical approaches to modelling are common practice. Even so, to our knowledge, only one study has been published that compares the two approaches for biomass estimation purposes using ALS data. The study by Hollaus et al. [5] found that the performances of an empirical and a semi-empirical approach were similar in terms of the coefficient of determination. Hollaus et al. [5], somewhat unexpectedly, found that the MSE and standard deviation favored the semi-empirical approach. When assessing only MSD in the present study, we made similar observations for two of the five study sites (S2 and S5). However, a model-based variance estimate can be used in addition to the MSD to select a model that not only has a small estimated prediction error (MSD), but also a high estimated stability in the model parameters (slope and intercept), i.e., that model parameters are less influenced by new observations as indicated by the model-based variance estimate. The ME proposed in the present study is a novel combination of the MSD and a model-based variance estimator. Scatter plots of the two components of the ME (Figure 4) can be used to visualize the two components and their respective magnitudes. This can aid in deciding which estimators have the desired properties in terms of small MSD, small model-based variance, or a combination of the two. Using the proposed ME criterion, the empirical approach was found to result in smaller errors in the boreal and temperate biomes. In the tropical biome, the semi-empirical approach resulted in smaller ME.Comparisons of OLSLOG and OLSSQRT models show that the OLSSQRT models resulted in smaller MSD and ME. In three of the study sites, the difference in MSD was quite small (<8%). In S3 and S5 however, the OLSSQRT models resulted in MSD values that were 48% and 25% smaller than in the OLSLOG models. This is in contrast to Hansen et al. [35] who reported approximately 7% smaller MSD using logarithmic transformation compared to SQRT. However, only the response was transformed in Hansen et al. [35]. Other comparative studies have however also found advantages of using SQRT models compared to LOG [12,70].Comparisons of NLSMCH and NLSTCH using MCH and TCH respectively as predictor variables showed an advantage of using MCH in all study sites except for S3 where NLSTCH resulted in 20% smaller MSD compared to NLSMCH. Although Asner and Mascaro [61] argue that TCH is a more consistent predictor, less affected by sensor effects compared to MCH, our results suggest that using TCH instead of MCH comes at a cost of loss in prediction accuracy. A possible explanation could be that the MCH captures variations in the forest canopy structure better, compared to TCH. This is supported by the result for S3 where NLSTCH resulted in smaller MSD and ME compared to NLSMCH. S3 is characterized by low variation in age and AGB (Table 1).The types of statistical methods used to model the relationship between forest attributes and ALS data have possibly affected the results in the present study. Several other methods for modelling are available, most notably GLM, nearest neighbors techniques, neural networks, and the increasingly popular Random Forest algorithm. To assess these alternative methods is a great undertaking that we considered to be outside the scope of the present study. Instead, we chose to focus on two commonly used modelling methods: OLS and NLS. Furthermore, several of the non-parametric methods mentioned do not have available model-based variance estimators, and would require a different approach to produce a criterion similar to the ME.Even though the empirical approach resulted in smaller ME in boreal and temperate study sites, the semi-empirical approach could be a viable option based on advantageous properties such as re-use or re-calibration of models in new study sites [21]. Models that are relatively unaffected by noise, and that have a robust relationship between the response and predictor variable facilitate re-use or re-calibration. The model-based variance estimate, incorporated in the ME, could be calculated for new study sites, provided available ALS data. Thus, the proposed ME criterion could aid in the decision of modelling approach by providing a means of comparing the performance in terms of estimated variance to the estimated mean square error.", 4. Discussion,None,4
1060,"The results of the analysis showed that both approaches, empirical and semi-empirical, could be used to model the relationship between ALS data and AGB. The two approaches showed however differences in performance in terms of the two evaluation criteria. The semi-empirical approach resulted in the smallest MSD in three of five study sites, and in all three biomes represented in the present study. The ME criterion showed that the empirical approach resulted in smaller errors in the temperate and boreal biomes, while the semi-empirical approach resulted in smaller ME in the tropical biomes.Additionally, the results showed that OLSSQRT resulted in the smallest MSD and ME for all study sites taking the empirical approach. For the semi-empirical approach, the NLSMCH resulted in the smallest MSD and ME in four of the five study sites.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
1061,"Mangroves are special types of woody plants that grow exclusively in the intertidal zones of the tropics and subtropics, such as bays, estuaries and rivers [1]. Most mangrove species are dispersed as water-buoyant propagules, which allows them to employ currents both to replenish existing stands and to establish new ones [2]. Since mangroves are transitional zones, in which land, sea, and fresh water converge, their ecological functions are critical to the ecological health of surrounding marine ecosystems and adjacent upstream terrestrial environments [3]. Specifically, mangroves play an important role in coastal community protection from typhoons and tsunamis, shoreline stabilization, carbon sequestration, seawater purification, and fauna habitation, as well as being valued for aesthetic purposes [4]. Despite their ecological importance, between 30% and 60% of the world’s mangroves have been destroyed over recent decades [4,5].Hainan Island, the second-largest island in China, lost approximately 60% of its mangrove forests between the 1950s and the 2010s through its conversion to aquaculture, agriculture, and construction land [6,7]. Hainan Island has the most species-diverse mangrove forests in China, accounting for 95% of Chinese mangrove species [8]. The first Chinese national nature reserve for mangroves—Dongzhai Harbor National Nature Reserve—is located on Hainan Island. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the mangroves of Hainan Island and evaluate their biophysical status in response to forest ecosystem degradation and land use changes. Among characteristics such as the mangrove extent, height, biomass, and other structural attributes, only the mangrove extent has been reported for Hainan Island [6], and the other attributes have rarely been presented. Therefore, this study intends to estimate and map the height and aboveground biomass (AGB) of the mangrove forests on whole Hainan Island.Since remote sensing techniques can provide large-scale and accurate information on forests, they have been widely used for forest inventory in the past two decades [9,10]. Usually, forest attributes are estimated by statistical models that relate a certain number of ground measurements to remote sensing features extracted from co-located remote sensing imagery. For example, Jachowski et al. [11] related field estimated biomass with GeoEye-1 imagery and ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) satellite elevation data, Pham and Brabyn [12] linked field plots to SPOT-4/5 imagery, and Fatoyinbo et al. [5] coupled ground measurements with airborne LiDAR data to retrieve mangrove AGB. Wang et al. [13] provided a review of remote sensing for mangrove forests from 1956 to 2018 that includes a subsection on mangrove vertical structure and biomass. However, when the study area is large or the target forest is diverse and complex, a large number of field samples need to be collected in order to fit a satisfying model. Pereira et al. [14] proved that under suitable sampling pattern and provided that accurate field data are used, discrete return LiDAR data can accurately estimate and map mangrove AGB. Mangroves grow in intertidal mudflats inundated by periodic seawater with muddy anaerobic soils, high temperature and high salinity. Furthermore, many fresh oysters and shells attach themselves to the bottom roots of mangroves, especially those of Rhizophora spp., leading to frequent injuries to investigators’ legs and feet. Therefore, it is more difficult to conduct extensive field sampling in mangrove forests than terrestrial forests [13].Over the past decade, three-dimensional (3D) measuring techniques from remote sensing have been used for forest sampling to reduce field sampling work and inform on local information [15,16,17]. Wulder et al. [15] provided a comprehensive overview of using LiDAR sampling as a means to enable large-area forest characterizations, in which LiDAR samples were used in a manner similar to field samples. Matasci et al. [10] used transect-based national survey airborne LiDAR data as calibration and validation samples, and used Landsat composites as auxiliary data to estimate and map boreal forest cover, height, biomass and other structural attributes in large area. An imputation model was employed to predict forest structural attributes with R2 values ranging from 0.49 to 0.61 for key response variables. Huang et al. [18] used Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS) LiDAR data as intermediate data to link field estimated AGB with Landsat images and Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR) data to estimate and map forest AGB in China. Their resultant R2 ranged from 0.54 to 0.64. Puliti et al. [19] employed UAV digital stereo imagery as a sampling tool, which is coupled with a small sample of field data and wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 imagery, to estimate growing stock volume based on a hierarchical model-based inference. Though a relatively low adjusted R2 (0.30) was obtained, the standard error as percentage of the mean derived from the UAV sampling case was satisfactory. However, airborne and satellite LiDAR sampling methods may be unsuitable or inefficient for studying mangroves, because mangrove distribution is discontinuous [1,13]. A case may arise in which only 10% of the obtained data capture mangroves from a flight using airborne LiDAR. Because stereo imagery is inherently limited, the digital stereo imagery sampling approach only generates upper canopy points and faces difficulties in obtaining the vertical structure of mangroves. LiDAR sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV-LiDAR) offers a potential alternative method for mangrove sampling. Compared with traditional airborne and satellite LiDAR, the laser pulses of UAV-LiDAR can penetrate tree canopies and capture the internal structure of trees at low cost and with high mobility [20].After UAV-LiDAR was selected as the sampling tool for this study, the globally and freely available Sentinel-2 imagery was chosen as wall-to-wall auxiliary data. Since its launch, the generated Sentinel-2 data perform well on terrestrial forest inventory [21,22]. Compared with Landsat imagery, the Sentinel-2 imagery not only has a relatively high spatial resolution, but also has three additional red-edge bands. Moreover, it has a short revisit period of five days, which is important for tropical regions in which clouds are frequent. To date, only a few studies have used Sentinel-2 data to retrieve mangrove AGB and no study has used it to estimate mangrove height. For example, Castillo et al. [23] used Sentinel-1/2 imagery to estimate and map the AGB of mangroves and their replacement land uses. Pham et al. [24] integrated Sentinel-2 and ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 data to retrieve the AGB of an artificial mangrove forest.The aim of this study is to estimate and map the height and AGB of mangrove forests on whole Hainan Island using a UAV-LiDAR sampling method that combines field plots, UAV-LiDAR point clouds and Sentinel-2 imagery. The specific objectives of the study are to (1) estimate and map the height and AGB of the mangroves on Hainan Island; (2) assess whether UAV-LiDAR is feasible as a sampling tool; and (3) examine which UAV-LiDAR metrics and Sentinel-2 indices are more important for mangrove height and AGB estimations.", 1.

1062,"Hainan Island, presented in Figure 1, is located in the south of China (108°37′–111°03′E, 18°10′–20°10′N) and has a total area of 33,900 km2. Hainan Island is characterized by a tropical monsoon climate. The annual average temperature is about 24 °C, and the annual precipitation is 1639 mm, with a rainy season between May and October. Presently, there are approximately 3600 ha of mangroves on Hainan Island [6,8,25]. The main distribution sites of these mangroves lie in the northeast of Hainan Island, namely, Dongzhai National Nature Reserve (DNR) and Qinglan Provincial Nature Reserve (QPR), which account for about 70% of the total area of Hainan Island’s mangroves. The major mangrove species on Hainan Island are Rhizophora stylosa, Bruguiera sexangula, Ceriops tagal, Lumnitzera racemosa, Avicennia marina, Kandelia candel, Rhizophora apiculata, Excoecaria agallocha, and Sonneratia spp. [26].The field survey was conducted in July and August 2018 and March 2019. A total of 97 field plots, which include all major mangrove species on Hainan Island, were collected. A field plot has a square or rectangular shape and a size between 100 and 600 m2 depending on mangrove species composition, community structure complexity, and geographical location. We first marked the vertices of the plots and measured their geographical coordinates by using a Real-Time Kinematic Global Navigation Satellite System (RTK-GNSS) based on continuously operating reference stations (CORS) with centimeter-level accuracy. Then, we measured the tree diameter at breast height (DBH, at 1.37 m) and recorded the species of each tree. For stilt rooted species (such as R. apiculate and R. stylosa), the stem diameter was measured above the highest stilt root. Due to the requirements of tree height in the allometric equations of A. corniculatum and K. candel and the small number of them, we measured the tree height of the two species by a hand-held hypsometer. The range of DBH was 1.5–85.99 cm with a mean value of 8.68 cm. The range of tree density was 6–528 tree/100 m2, with a mean density of 102 tree/100 m2. Finally, we used species-specific biomass allometric equations (presented in Table 1) to calculate an individual tree’s AGB and then summed the AGB values in each field plot. The average AGB density from the field survey was 143.41 ± 87.81 Mg ha−1. The maximum AGB density was 347.20 Mg ha−1, and the minimum AGB was 1.90 Mg ha−1.", 2. Materials, 2.1. Study Area and Field Survey,2
1063,"The UAV-LiDAR point clouds were obtained by a Velodyne VLP-16 Puck sensor mounted on a DJI M600 UAV on 25–28 March 2018. This laser sensor has 16 scanning channels and operates at 903 nm wavelength, which can produce up to 300,000 points per second. We conducted 16 flights in the study area with a flight altitude of 52 m, a flight speed of 5 m/s, and an average swath width of 110 m. The UAV flight times were selected in low- or middle-tide period. Overall, the mean point density of all collected LiDAR data was 94 points/m2. Figure 2 describes the workflow of UAV-LiDAR data processing. The main processing steps for point clouds included GNSS-aided aero-triangulation, point denoise, ground point extraction and point cloud normalization (Figure 2). The GNSS-aided aero-triangulation was used to calculate the accurate geographical positions of point clouds based on base station location data and POS (position and orientation system) data, which was conducted in POSPac UAV 8.1 software (Applanix, Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada). The point denoise was utilized to filter noise points that are located above and below the mangrove forests, which was done by using the Remove Outliers tool and the Noise Filter tool in LiDAR360 software (GreenValley, Being, China). Following the point denoise, the point clouds were classified as ground and non-ground points using an improved progressive TIN (triangulated irregular network) densification filtering algorithm [36]. The ground points were further inspected and edited in manual. The final ground point density was 62 points/ha. Then, these ground points were used to produce a digital elevation model (DEM). A digital surface model (DSM) was also produced based on all point clouds. Finally, to eliminate the influence of ground terrain on point clouds, the non-ground points were normalized by the DEM in LiDAR360 software. For detailed descriptions of the last three steps, refer to the LiDAR360 User Guide (http://greenvalleyintl.com/software/lidar360/).", 2. Materials, 2.2. UAV-LiDAR Data,2
1064,"We downloaded eight Sentinel-2 images from the Copernicus Open Access Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) to cover the entirety of Hainan Island depicted in Figure 1. Because the original imagery was Level-1C product, namely, orthorectified top of atmosphere reflectance data, it needed to be calibrated to a Level-2A product, namely, bottom-of-atmosphere reflectance data. This atmospheric correction was implemented using the Sen2Cor atmospheric correlation processor (version 2.5.5). The other key processing steps included resampling and co-registering to LiDAR data. The procedure for processing Sentinel-2 data is portrayed in Figure 2.", 2. Materials, 2.3. Sentinel-2 Data,2
1065,"Few studies have used high-density LiDAR point clouds to estimate mangrove AGB, and few studies have reported the most important LiDAR metrics for predicting mangrove AGB [13,14]. A total of 53 LiDAR metrics were derived preliminarily (24 for height, 12 for density, and 17 for canopy volume) [14,37], as presented in Table A1 [14,38,39,40]. A novel canopy thickness metric (CTHK) was created and used to describe the thickness of mangrove canopy based on the analysis of UAV-LiDAR point clouds [41]. In each field plot, the 53 LiDAR metrics were extracted. All of the LiDAR point clouds were first tessellated into grids with a cell size of 10 × 10 m with the same original point as that of the Sentinel-2 imagery. Subsequently, the 53 LiDAR metrics were computed for each cell.A total of 32 Sentinel-2 multispectral indices, presented in Table A2, were selected on the basis of their previous performance in studying mangroves and terrestrial forests. The indices consisted of 10 original Sentinel-2 bands, 7 conventional near-infrared indices, 12 red-edge indices, and 3 shortwave infrared indices.", 3. Methods, 3.1.

Firstly, an object-based decision tree classification method [42] was implemented for the processed Sentinel-2 imagery to discriminate mangroves from water, terrestrial vegetation and other lands (including construction land, mudflat and bare land). This process was conducted in eCognition 9.0 (Trimble, Sunnyvale, CO, USA) and multi-resolution segmentation was utilized with a scale of 30 in accordance with our previous study on Hainan Island [43]. Then, these candidate mangrove patches were visually examined one by one in high spatial resolution imagery from Google Earth; the examination was carried out by two mangrove researchers who had approximately 10 years of mangrove research experience. During the process, false patches were deleted or edited, and the underestimated mangroves were added manually in eCognition 9.0. Subsequently, the mangrove pixel cells with an FDI (forest discrimination index) [44] higher than 200 were eliminated to exclude non-vegetation (such as mudflats) and grass from the set of mangrove objects. Finally, a thematic map of the mangrove extent on whole Hainan Island was obtained.", 3. Methods, 3.2. Mangrove Extent Extraction,3
1067,"In this study, LiDAR sampling involved a series of LiDAR transects acquired over an area of interest and used as samples. Then, the established procedures from field sample-based forest inventories are adapted and applied to the LiDAR samples [15], which means the LiDAR samples are used in a similar manner to field samples. Since the point cloud density in the 20 m distance off the UAV flight strip centerlines is more uniform, only the LiDAR grid cells in this 40 m range were used as LiDAR plot samples. We finally obtained 14,628 candidate LiDAR samples with size of 10 ×10 m.  3.3.1. Height Estimation ModelUAV-LiDAR data have high-density point clouds and can obtain mangrove heights with high accuracy [45]. Therefore, the canopy heights of the partial-coverage UAV-LiDAR grid cells were directly used as reference data for Sentinel-2 data to fit a height prediction model (top graph in Figure 3). The canopy heights were derived by subtracting the DEM from the DSM. The Sentinel-2 features were used as explanatory variables. The constructed height estimation model was named LiDAR~S2 (top picture in Figure 3). 3.3.2. AGB Estimation ModelTo estimate AGB, we first constructed a model, named G~LiDAR, to link ground plot AGB with coinciding UAV-LiDAR point clouds (clipped by the polygon of the field plot) and then obtained UAV-LiDAR-estimated AGB.

Then the G~LiDAR model was applied to the 14,628 LiDAR plot samples to obtained the AGB of these LiDAR grid cells.Subsequently, the UAV-LiDAR-estimated AGB values of the LiDAR grid cells were used as reference data for the wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data to fit a retrieval model, named

1070,"The random forest (RF) algorithm was employed for all mangrove height and AGB estimation models in this study due to its good performance of building prediction models [46,47]. RF regression first builds a large number of decision trees and then averages the prediction values of all trees to obtain the final estimates [48]. There are two important parameters when building an RF model: ntree and mtry. The ntree parameter determines the maximum number of created decision trees, while the mtry parameter control the number of features that are randomly selected to compute the best split at each node of each decision tree. In this study, we set the value of ntree to 5000, which is big enough for error to become convergent, and set the value of mtry to the default value, namely the square root of the total number of input features. The RF algorithm can also evaluate the importance of input variables by using out-of-bag (OOB) samples through a random permutation method. The increase of mean square error (MSE) from the changed OOB samples are compared with the original MSE of OOB samples, and then a metric %IncMSE (the percentage increase in the mean square error) is obtained and used to quantitate the importance of each predictor variable [12]. The OOB samples are mainly utilized to assess the accuracy of the newly fitted RF model. The detailed process of how the RF algorithm measures feature importance was described by Breiman [48], and a specific application was presented by Pham and Brabyn [12]. Usually, a model constructed from a small number of predictor variables is more interpretable and eliminating irrelevant and highly correlated variables may improve the predictive power [49]. Therefore, prior to building the final prediction models, an RF-based backward feature elimination method was utilized to optimize the feature space for each model [12,50]. The method compared the cross-validated prediction results of RF models, and 10% of variables were eliminated at a time. When the cross-validation error of a set of features was within one standard deviation of the minimum cross-validation error, and when the number of this feature set was at a minimum, this group of features was considered to be the set of optimal predictor variables. In this study, the R package was used to implement the backward feature elimination method, which was replicated 20 times, with 5-fold cross-validation, to get the optimal variables [50].", 3.

1071,"The classification accuracy of mangrove extent was assessed by the overall classification accuracy (OA), the producer’s accuracy (PA), and the user’s accuracy (UA) using a classification confusion matrix [51]. Since we focused on mangrove extent extraction, when assessing classification accuracy, other land cover classes such as water, terrestrial vegetation, construction, and bare lands were all merged as “non-mangroves”. Two-hundred points per class (mangroves and non-mangroves) were randomly generated and used to assess mangrove identification accuracy.For mangrove height and AGB estimation accuracy assessments, the coefficient of determination R2, root-mean-square-error (RMSE), and RMSE expressed as a percentage of the observed mean (RMSE%) were employed [10,12]. Specifically, 4281 randomly selected LiDAR plots (10 × 10 m) were used to calibrate and validate the height estimation model. Of the 4281 LiDAR plots, 2/3 of them were used for training and 1/3 were used for validation.For the first-stage AGB estimation model (G~LiDAR), of the 97 field samples, 62 samples inside the UAV-LiDAR coverage area were used for training, and accuracy was assessed by the 10-fold cross-validation method.

Figure 5B reveals that some low height points were overestimated, while underestimation occurred for high height points greater than 15 m. Figure 5A also reflects this phenomenon.

1078,"The resultant mangrove height and AGB maps of Hainan Island are presented in Figure 6 and Figure 7, respectively. The summaries of mangrove height and AGB in different districts of Hainan Island are shown in Table 5.The mean height of the mangrove forests on Hainan Island was 6.99 m with a standard deviation of 2.14 m. There were three districts whose mangroves had a mean height of over 8 m—Wenchang, Dongfang and Qionghai. The mangrove area of Wenchang was the largest, and the mangrove areas of the other two districts were less than 100 ha. In Figure 6C, the yellow and red colors show that the height of most of the mangroves in Qinglan Harbor (Wenchang) was higher than 8 m. The dwarf mangroves, indicated by dark blue, were mainly distributed in the north of Dongzhai Harbor (Haikou), which results in the lowest average tree height of mangroves in Haikou (5.93 m).The total mangrove AGB on Hainan Island was 474,199.31 Mg, with a mean AGB of 128.27 ± 45.87 Mg ha−1. The mangrove AGB hot spots mainly lay in Qinglan Harbor and the south of Dongzhai Harbor. Although areas with high AGB were found in other places, such as Danzhou Bay (Danzhou) presented in Figure 7D, their area was small with a scattered distribution. Among the nine districts, the mangroves of Wenchang, Dongfang and Qionghai had the highest AGB density, while the mangroves of Haikou had the lowest mean AGB of 106.47 Mg ha−1.

 for AGB estimation was an indirect model and its training samples were secondhand data, the importance of the input features in this model was not measured.Figure 8A shows that the MERIS terrestrial chlorophyll index derived from red edge bands and blue Band 2 were the two most important features for mangrove height estimation. The mangrove discrimination index 1 and the modified normalized difference water index ranked third and fourth in importance, respectively. The two indices were computed from shortwave infrared Band 11.Figure 8B indicates that the newly created canopy thickness metric was the most important LiDAR metric for predicting mangrove AGB. The LiDAR indices that describe the characteristics of the upper canopy (H80, H90, H95) ranked second in importance, while the H10 and H05 metrics describing bottom canopy characteristics ranked third for mangrove AGB estimation. The HVAR and HSD metrics, which characterize the mangrove canopy variation, ranked last among these selected features, along with the density metric D01 and the canopy coverage index CC1.3.Figure 8C shows that red-edge Band 5 was the most important feature for estimating mangrove AGB among all Sentinel-2 original bands and multispectral indices. The red, green, and blue bands also ranked among the top five. Although there were six red-edge features selected and only three SWIR features chosen, the MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index) and MDI1 (Mangrove Discrimination Index 1) calculated from SWIR ranked higher than the five red-edge-derived indices.

1080,"Mangrove height and biomass are related to geographical location, species composition and structure, water-heat conditions, community development status, and external disturbances. The average mangrove height on Hainan Island is 6.99 ± 2.14 m, which is significantly higher than other Chinese mangroves, such as the mangroves in Zhangjiang estuary, Fujian province (mean height 3.1 m) [53], and Dandou Sea coast, Guanxi province (mean height < 3.5 m) [45]. The reason may be that the latitude of mangroves on Hainan Island (18°–19°N) is lower than the latitude of mangroves in other places in China (21°–28°N) [54,55]. Another explanation for this is that the tall mangrove species B. sexangula and Sonneratia spp. (usually taller than 8 m) only grow on Hainan Island [7], and B. sexangula is one of the dominant species in the south of Dongzhai Harbor and Qinglan Harbor, covering a large number of areas. For the other seven major mangrove species on Hainan Island, the height of R. stylosa, K. candel, R. apiculata, and E. agallocha is usually 4–8 m, while the height of C. tagal, L. racemosa, and A. marina is usually lower than 3 m. The low height range covers a great number of mangrove species in the study area, which may result in the underestimate bias in low trees. While, the underestimate bias of high trees may be attributed to the radiometric saturation effect of Sentinel-2 imagery [19].Previous studies have portrayed mangrove tree height as directly related to AGB [56,57]. Saenger and Snedaker [58] even provided a global scale allometric equation that links tree height with AGB for mangrove forests: AGB (Mg ha−1) = 10.8 × H(m) + 35. Therefore, the mangrove AGB density on Hainan Island should greater than the mangrove AGB density in other regions of China. This inference is supported by comparisons between the predicted mangrove AGB on Hainan Island and the reported mangrove AGB in other sites in China. For example, Wang et al. [59] reported a mangrove AGB of 79 Mg ha−1 in Jiulong River Estuary, Fujian, China and Jiang et al. [60] reported a mangrove AGB density of 54.81 Mg ha−1 in Shenzhen Bay, Guangdong, China. They were all lower than the mean AGB of the mangroves on Hainan Island (128.27 Mg ha−1).The average height of Hainan Island’s mangroves (6.99 m) is higher than the mean height of mangroves (~5.0 m) in the Everglades National Park, Florida, USA, reported by Simard et al. [56], and greater than the mean height of mangroves (3.2 m) reported by Hickey et al. [61] in northwest Australia. However, they are lower than the average height of mangroves (7.5 m) reported by Fatoyinbo and Simard [62] for all of Africa and significantly lower than the mangrove mean height (~21 m) in Papua, Indonesia, given by Asian et al. [3]. A similar trend is found by comparing the mangrove AGB in these four places with the mangrove AGB on Hainan Island. The mangrove AGB density on Hainan Island (128.27 Mg ha−1) is higher than the mangrove AGB density (38.77 Mg ha−1) in the Everglades National Park, Florida, USA [56], greater than the mangrove AGB density in northwest Australia (70 Mg ha−1) [61], and slightly higher than the mean mangrove AGB (116 Mg ha−1) on the African continent [62]; however, it is significantly lower than the mangrove AGB density in Papua, Indonesia (292.72 Mg ha−1) [3]. These discrepancies could be attributed to differences in geographical location, climate, and species composition. For example, in the Everglades National Park, scrub forests are widely distributed on internal coasts as well as inland, and this park is located at 25° N, which is higher than the latitude of Hainan Island (18–20° N).To date, no global mangrove height map has been published. The reported global mangrove AGB density of 184.8 Mg ha−1 was deduced by a climate-based model and not from remote sensing surveys [54]. However, we can infer that the mean height and mean AGB of the mangrove forests on Hainan Island are higher than the mean height and mean AGB of the majority of other mangroves in China and lower than the global mean height and AGB of mangrove forests. The height inference is based on the comprehensive consideration of the global mangrove distribution [63], climate [54], and mangrove species composition [64]. If we substitute the global mangrove AGB density value of 184.8 Mg ha−1 into the global equation of AGB (Mg ha−1) = 10.8 × H(m) + 35, we can deduce that the global average height of mangrove forests is about 13.87 m, which is higher than the mean mangrove height on Hainan Island.Consequently, the obtained height and AGB maps of mangrove forests on Hainan Island are useful. Firstly, they could provide an opportunity to address mangrove restoration problems and provide insights into the dynamics of mangrove recovery. For example, a mangrove reforestation plan has been widely implemented on Hainan Island in order to restore and rehabilitate mangrove forests (Figure 9). Secondly, the maps could serve as a baseline for future mangrove studies, such as the mangrove response to hurricanes and sea level rise.", 5. Discussion, 5.1. The Mangrove Height and AGB on Hainan Island and Comparison with Mangroves in Other Areas,5
1081,"Previous studies have always mentioned the great difficulty of fieldwork in a mangrove habitat [3,13]. Because of the mudflat and shallow seawater environment, investigators cannot walk in most mangrove habitats with outdoor shoes, which become struck in the mud, but have to be barefoot or wear long rain-shoes. For example, while field sampling mangroves on Hainan Island, we often walked barefoot (Figure 10A). Hence, it was easy to suffer arm and leg injuries due to mangrove branches and roots or shells and oysters in the water. Furthermore, since mangroves are distributed in tropical and subtropical regions, there are many mosquitos in mangrove forests all year round. In the field survey of mangroves on Hainan Island, investigators were sometimes bitten by mosquitoes more than 20 times a day. In addition, because of the high density of the forests and the aerial and prop roots at the bottom, it is difficult for investigators to walk through mangrove forests (Figure 10). These factors make fieldwork in mangrove habitats more challenging than fieldwork in terrestrial forests. The great difficulty of fieldwork in mangrove forests is also one of the reasons that key research topics in mangrove remote sensing have lagged behind key research topics in terrestrial forests, as concluded by Wang et al. [13], who conducted a comprehensive review of the mangrove remote sensing studies conducted over the past sixty years. This may also explain the lack of a thematic AGB map of mangroves produced by remote sensing techniques to date.This study proposes a UAV-LiDAR sampling method for estimating mangrove height and AGB to overcome the challenges of fieldwork in mangrove habitats. UAV-LiDAR can characterize mangrove morphology with a finer spatial resolution [20,45]. In addition, UAV-LiDAR is more flexible than airborne and satellite LiDAR because it can work on any low-wind day with arbitrary time intervals. This flexible and operational characteristic makes UAV-LiDAR very suitable for sampling elongated patches of mangroves. The good accuracy (height: R2 = 0.67, RMSE% = 26.24%; AGB: R2 = 0.62, RMSE% = 35.41%) obtained from the UAV-LiDAR sampling method (height: LiDAR~S2 model; AGB: G~LiDAR~S2 model) in this study also demonstrates the feasibility of UAV-LiDAR sampling for mangroves (Table 4).The derived AGB estimation accuracy is similar to the accuracy (R2 = 0.62, RMSE% = 40.00%) reported by Pham and Brabyn [12] who used spectral bands, vegetation indices and texture of 10 m SPOT-5 imagery. Considering that their study area only has three floral association types and that Hainan Island has more than nine main mangrove communities, our estimation accuracy is satisfying. Compared with the AGB prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.55, RMSE% = 47.07%) reported by Asian et al. [3], the accuracy produced by the G~LiDAR~S2 model is higher. However, the AGB accuracy in this study is lower than the accuracy (R2 = 0.82–0.84, RMSE% = ~43%) reported by Castillo et al. [23] using Sentinel-1/2 imagery and lower than the accuracy (R2 = 0.80–0.88, RMSE% = 23–33%) reported by Fatoyinbo et al. [5] using wall-to-wall airborne LiDAR data. The former could be attributed to the study area of Castillo et al. [23] being dominated by one mangrove genus, namely, Rhizophora, which means that the forest structure is relatively simple compared with Hainan Island’s diverse mangrove forests. The latter is likely to be related to the data difference and retrieval unit of the map. Fatoyinbo et al. [5] used full-coverage LiDAR data with a point density of 10 points/m2, and their estimation unit was 25 m. In our study, the UAV-LiDAR data was just partial coverage, with Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery used as wall-to-wall auxiliary data, and the calculation unit was 10 m. When directly linking the field plots with the UAV-LiDAR data (G~LiDAR model) in our study, relatively high accuracy is produced with R2 = 0.78–0.80 and RMSE% = 28–29%. In addition, for heterogenous mangrove forests, large statistical units may improve prediction accuracy but reduce detail information [14]. Therefore, these findings prove that UAV-LiDAR is feasible for mangrove sampling.There is uncertainty in the height (LiDAR~S2) and AGB estimation models (G~LiDAR~S2) based on LiDAR sampling. For the LiDAR~S2 model, the uncertainty is mainly from LiDAR plot sampling and model fitting, which is similar to the uncertainty of the two-phase hybrid inference using partial-coverage UAV data for the forest volume estimation reported by Puliti et al. [16]. Concerning to the G~LiDAR~S2 model, its uncertainty includes the uncertainty of two stages, namely G~LiDAR and

. The first-stage G~LiDAR is model-based inference [15,16]. When field samples are collected according to probabilistic principles, its uncertainty is mainly from model fitting. Pereira et al. [14] discussed how to reduce uncertainty in mapping mangrove AGB using field plots and airborne LiDAR data. The second-stage 



LiDAR

 belongs to hybrid inference [19,65]. Its uncertainty is not only caused by LiDAR plot sampling and model fitting but also by error propagation from the first-stage estimated AGB values. In addition, our study employed the non-parameter RF regression to fit models. The uncertainty of LiDAR sampling-based model is an important issue for future research. Réjou-Méchain et al. [66] presented several caveats when using very high spatial resolution products to bridge field plots and large-scale remote sensing data. They also analyzed the sources of error and discussed ways to reduce these errors in the process of upscaling forest biomass from field to satellite measurements. Regarding to model fitting error, the deep learning-based retrieval model may be an alternative to the RF model in the future [67]. ", 5. Discussion, 5.2. Fieldwork Challenges in Mangrove Habitats and the Feasibility of LiDAR Sampling,5
1082,"Because there is a lack of accurate training data for mangrove height, few studies have used passive remote sensing data to estimate mangrove height [13]. Therefore, the spectral bands that are important for mangrove height inversion are not yet clear. This study presents the first attempt to invert mangrove height using Sentinel-2 data. The results for the importance of the variables show that the red-edge derived MERIS (Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) terrestrial chlorophyll index (MTCI) plays the most important role in predicting mangrove height. The MTCI is correlated strongly with red-edge bands but, in contrast to red-edge bands, is sensitive to high values of chlorophyll content [68]. Pastor-Guzman et al. [69] also demonstrated that the MTCI is highly correlated with mangrove chlorophyll concentration. Meanwhile, taller mangrove forests on Hainan Island usually have denser branches and leaves, which could indicate a higher chlorophyll concentration. It is difficult to explain the second-ranking of the blue band, but its considerable importance was also shown in a mangrove AGB retrieval study using WorldView-2 imagery [70] and a terrestrial forest growing stock volume prediction study utilizing Sentinel-2 imagery [21]. The SWIR bands are low-reflectance bands compared with near-infrared bands and are sensitive to the leaf structure and water content of plants. Thus, mangroves show a low spectral reflectance in the SWIR bands that varies according to the amount of water content in different mangrove species. This may explain why the SWIR features play important roles in mangrove height estimation. In addition, the importance of these SWIR features may be related to the fact that tall mangroves are distributed in middle- and low-tide zones and closer to hydrological features than dwarf mangroves, such as the creek entrance in Dongzhai Harbor (Figure 7B) and the river in Qinglan Harbor (Figure 7C).Of the Sentinel-2 features for mangrove AGB prediction, the red-edge 1 and SWIR 1 bands, along with their derived indices, are the highest in terms of importance when considering both the ranking and the number of features, thus confirming the results reported by Zhu et al. [70] and Castillo et al. [23]. Usually, a slight change in vegetation properties (such as leaf structure, chlorophyll content, and leaf pigments) leads to an obvious shift in the red-edge spectral curve [71], which may explain why red-edge features are incredibly important for predicting mangrove AGB. The reasons for the significant importance of the SWIR 1 features in mangrove AGB prediction are similar to those of the importance of SWIR features in mangrove height estimation. In addition, Wang and Sousa [72] also proved that wavebands in the red-edge (780, 790 and 800 nm) and SWIR (1480, 1530 and 1550 nm) bands are the most informative bands for mangrove species discrimination. Mangrove AGB is also correlated with mangrove species [11,29]. The higher ranking of the blue, green and red bands are in line with what was observed by Zhu et al. [70], Mura et al. [21], and Pham and Brabyn [12]. The higher rankings may also partly be explained by their higher spatial resolution of 10 m compared with other multispectral bands of Sentinel-2 imagery (20 or 60 m), except for the near-infrared Band 8.Of the UAV-LiDAR metrics, the newly created canopy thickness metric is the most important predictor variable. Given the weaker penetration ability of UAV-LiDAR (limited by the loading capacity of the UAV platform) compared with airborne LiDAR, the pulse beam emitted by UAV-LiDAR may not penetrate a very dense canopy and detect specific branches. Nonetheless, UAV-LiDAR could still capture the canopy thickness of mangroves, and the taller AGB mangroves usually have thicker canopies (CTHK = H90–H10). Figure 11 illustrates the profiles of three dominant mangrove species on Hainan Island on UAV-LiDAR point clouds. The canopy thickness of B. sexangula, R. stylosa and L. racemosa is 3.06, 1.40, and 0.89 m, respectively, with the AGB density of 215.20, 110.36, and 62.83 Mg ha−1. This also explains why the LiDAR metrics that characterize the upper canopy (H80, H90, H95) and the bottom canopy (H05, H10) are found to be important for mangrove AGB estimation in this study, which is consistent with the results of Fatoyinbo et al. [5], Pereira et al. [14], and Hickey et al. [61], who demonstrated the crucial importance of the LiDAR metrics that characterize the upper canopy for mangrove AGB prediction. The last four LiDAR metrics include two metrics describing the point cloud variation (HVAR and HSD), one density metric (D01), and one canopy cover index (CC1.3). The sensitivity of the HVAR and HSD in this study are in accordance with what was observed by Owers et al. [40] in a mangrove AGB study using terrestrial LiDAR. Consequently, we can infer that the canopy thickness is the most important LiDAR metric for mangrove AGB estimation, followed by upper canopy height metrics, bottom canopy height metrics, and point cloud variation metrics, in that order.", 5. Discussion, 5.3. Relevance of Predictor Variables,5
1083,"This study presents the first mangrove height and aboveground biomass (AGB) maps of Hainan Island using a novel UAV-LiDAR sampling method with Sentinel-2 imagery as auxiliary data. From UAV-LiDAR sampling, we constructed the LiDAR-S2 and G~LiDAR~S2 models for mangrove height and AGB estimations based on random forest regression, respectively. The LiDAR~S2 height model uses LiDAR plots as training samples and links the UAV-LiDAR observed height with Sentinel-2 data. The G~LiDAR~S2 AGB model utilizes the transect-based UAV-LiDAR data as intermediate data to transfer AGB from field plots to wall-to-wall Sentinel-2 data. The results show that the LiDAR-S2 model performed well and the G~LiDAR~S2 model performed better than the traditional remote sensing model (G~S2) that directly related ground plots and Sentinel-2 data. We found that the mean height of Hainan Island’s mangroves is 6.99 m with a standard deviation of 2.14 m. A total mangrove AGB of 474,199.31 Mg with a mean AGB of 128.27 ± 45.87 Mg ha−1 was found on the whole Hainan Island. The mangrove height map was similar to the mangrove AGB map, and the tall mangroves and AGB hotspots were mainly distributed in the south of the Dongzhai Harbor and Qinglan Harbor. Comparative analysis also shows that the mean mangrove height and AGB on Hainan Island are higher than those of other Chinese mangrove forests but lower than the global mean values of mangrove forests.In addition, the results indicate that the canopy thickness metric, the upper canopy height metrics, and the bottom canopy height metrics, in descending order of importance, are the most informative variables for mangrove AGB estimation. Of the Sentinel-2 features, the red-edge and shortwave infrared features, especially the red-edge Band 5 and shortwave infrared Band 11 features, play the most important roles in mangrove AGB and height estimations.Overall, this study confirms that UAV-LiDAR sampling can increase the distribution and sample size of local data to inform on stand structure for forest attribute estimations. The successful application of UAV-LiDAR sampling at the entire Hainan Island is also a major operational advance in estimating and mapping mangrove structure over large areas. The first mangrove height and AGB maps may serve as important reference data for the management and protection of mangroves on Hainan Island and may also be used as a baseline for future mangrove studies in this region, such as biomass change and mangrove response to climate warning and sea level rising.

1084,"Global forests occupy 31% (4.0 × 107 km2) of the total land area [1]. Tropical forests play a very important role in global carbon cycles, water and heat fluxes [2,3], biodiversity, and water and soil conservation, and produce half of the total Net Primary Production (NPP) of the world. However, across the world many tropical forests are being converted to farmlands, pastures, or other land cover types driven by the increasing demand for food, energy, and economic activity, among others [4]. Moreover, in the past few decades over 80% of agricultural expansions occurred in tropical forest regions [4,5]. Tropical forest loss and degradation also affect different ecosystem services, which oftentimes lead to natural disasters. Accurate and up-to-date tropical forest maps are very important for tropical forest management and proper monitoring [6]. In some tropical areas, the increasing expansion of rubber plantations, to mention but one example, continually encroach tropical evergreen forests [7] in such a way that their areas are gradually decreasing. This situation causes a series of environmental problems, such as loss of biodiversity, and drought with such a magnitude that it becomes a hotspot issue to monitor the extent and change of forests in these areas that are prone to transition from primary forests to rubber plantations.Producing timely and accurate tropical evergreen forest inventory data is very important for decision making and forest management. In this context, field measurements are also needed to validate biophysical attributes of the vegetation such as volume, carbon stocks, tree height, etc. However, traditional field sampling methods are limited in their application to tropical mountainous regions, and the accuracy of inventory data is constrained by the quality and quantity of the field samples [8]. Fortunately, remote sensing methods have evolved sufficiently to support forest inventories in large landscapes [9], which allows rapid, automatic, and periodical estimates of many forest inventory attributes [8] and can also help to improve the precision of forest area estimates [10].Phenology is a vegetation feature that may be used to identify different characteristics such as plant growth, external shape forms, and colors. Phenology patterns are results of how vegetation adapts to the physical environment and climate over a long period of time, and is a very stable feature. Phenological differences among land cover types can be used for classification by means of remote sensing technology. Some terrestrial objects are difficult to be discerned by optical images since their spectral properties are very similar. Nevertheless, these objects can be easily distinguished in a specific period during the year given their particular phenological features during that same period of the year. For instance, evergreen forests and rubber plantations have very similar characteristics across environmental gradients in Southeast Asia. However, they can be easily distinguished by assessing their leaf-on and leaf-off phases, since rubber plantations are deciduous in winter but evergreen forests are not. In recent years, phenology-based methods have been used extensively in the field of vegetation monitoring by remote sensing technology, particularly for crops and plantations [11,12]. Combining satellite observations and ground truth data is an efficient way for land cover classification. Further, extraction of vegetation spatial distribution patterns based on long-term time series of satellite data is an important application of remote sensing technology.The Landsat sensor has acquired global observation records for more than four decades, and can be freely accessed. This is an invaluable data source for local, regional, or global forest monitoring. Several Landsat-based global forest products have been generated, including a global map of mangroves [13], a 30-m global land cover map between 1999 to 2011 [14], and a global forest cover change map [15]. Landsat missions (Thematic Mapper TM, Enhanced Thematic Mapper /ETM+, and the Operational Land Imager /OLI) have been extensively used to map forests [1,15,16], but due to frequent cloud cover, high-quality images are hard to capture in tropical regions. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imagery with a temporal resolution of eight days increases the chance to obtain quality data for target objects, and helps alleviate the shortage of other optical remote sensing sensors. MODIS is extensively used in Land Use and Land Cover Change (LULCC) studies including crop and plantation monitoring [5,17,18]. For instance, inter-annual time-series MODIS Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) have been efficiently used to identify rubber plantations in tropical mountainous regions [19].In recent years, there has been an increasing interest by researchers worldwide to integrate imagery from multiple sensors. Landsat and Radar have been integrated to map rubber plantations in tropical regions [11], and MODIS and Landsat have been jointly used to monitor crops [20]. Hence, integration of multi-source remote sensing images is a growing research trend in many fields.This study aims to integrate 500-m MODIS and 30-m Landsat to identify tropical evergreen forests based on vegetation phenology characteristics. MODIS with a high-revisit period (eight-days) enables capturing abundant and high-quality data for phenology-based time series analysis. Landsat data with fine spatial resolution (30m) can provide detailed spatial information and reduce mixing pixels to improve classification accuracy. Annual time-series MODIS Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), EVI, and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) are used to identify the key phenology phase that best fits tropical evergreen forest through analysis of differences in NDVI, EVI, and LSWI between evergreen forests and other typical land cover types. During the key phenology phase, indices and relevant thresholds were also identified through analysis and statistics of the values of NDVI, EVI, and LSWI for different land cover types based on 30-m Landsat images.The objective of this study was to develop a phenology-based method for quickly extracting tropical evergreen forests for inventories and exploring their spatial distribution patterns by integrating MODIS and Landsat images across large scales. Mengyang, Jinuo, and Yunjinghong in Xishuangbanna, China were selected as the study area. The developed method is able to get accurate extent, areas, and spatial distribution for large-scale tropical evergreen forest inventory at 30-m spatial resolutions. These datasets can support basic inventory data for forestry planning and managing, ecosystem monitoring, regional land management, and other relevant research and applications.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
1085,"This study was conducted in the Xishuangbanna Dai Nationality Autonomous Prefecture (Xishuangbanna), Yunnan, China. The total land area is 1.97 × 104 km2, and the majority of the land (95%) is considered mountainous. The elevation ranges 344 m to 2,605 m above sea level. The total population is 1.14 million, with 69% dedicated to agricultural activities according to the Year Statistical Book of Xishuangbanna in 2010 [21]. The average annual precipitation is 1,550 mm, and the mean annual temperature is 21.7 °C [22]. Two major seasons are recognized in the study area: dry (from November to April), and rainy (from May to October). Rubber plantations cover more than 50% of the Yunnan Province, and are the second largest in China. Three major towns are included in the study area (Figure 1): Mengyang, Jinuo, and Yunjinghong. Due to the economic importance of natural rubber and agriculture, land use conflicts are common in the study area between these two classes and tropical evergreen forests.", 2.

1086,"NDVI, EVI, and LSWI are frequently used to stratify different land cover types. The key phenology phase—defined as an optimal time window for distinguishing tropical evergreen forests from other land cover types—was identified through analysis of annual time series created from multi-temporal eight-day-composites 500-m MODIS MOD09A1. Landsat imagery was acquired from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) server, and converted to surface reflectance using Landsat Ecosystem Disturbance Adaptive Processing System (LEDAPS) [23]. The rectified imagery was further processed using Fmask [24] to deal with clouds and shadows. During the key phenology phase, tropical evergreen forest was distinguished from other land cover types by using the improved Landsat imagery. A collection of photo-interpreted samples for algorithm training, time-series analysis, and results verification were created from geo-referenced field photos and Google Earth high quality imagery. This method is very effective and extensively used in current studies [11,25,26]. Google Earth high quality imagery can provide a reliable data source for interpreting and extracting samples (Figure 1B–F). Five typical land cover types (evergreen forests, rubber plantations, built-land, farmlands, and water bodies) were classified in the study area. NDVI, EVI, and LSWI are calculated using formulas (1)–(3). Land cover data of 500-m MODIS MCD12Q1 was used to compare with the resultant map of tropical evergreen forests [27].

1087,"The key phenology phase is a relatively-fixed time window during which a particular vegetation type exhibits stable unique characteristics that are different from other land cover types. It is the optimal timing for distinguishing a kind of vegetation from others, and it was extensively used in previous studies [11,16,17]. Evergreen forests are stable ecosystems and have a strong resistance against influences from the physical environment (such as air temperature), whereas other land cover types (such as plantations and farmlands) are more susceptible to outside factors or mainly controlled by human activities. This phenomenon is generally reflected on the stability of annual NDVI, EVI, and LSWI time-series curves of different land cover types. For instance, the NDVI curves of evergreen-forests are more stable than others.Eight-day MODIS time-series have been extensively used to map paddy rice fields, forests, and plantations [17,28,29]. The key phenology phase can be identified through analysis of differences on annual time-series of MODIS NDVI, EVI, and LSWI of different land cover types. The fine temporal resolution is capable of capturing abundant, reliable, and continuous observation data in tropical regions, which supports annual time-series analysis for identification of the key phenology phase. Annual time-series profiles on NDVI, EVI, and LSWI of five typical land cover types were analyzed from temporal MODIS MOD09A1 between 2006 and 2014 based on samples created from geo-referenced field photos and Google Earth high resolution imagery. The method of creating these samples is very effective and extensively used in recent studies [11,16,26,30]. The phenological characteristics of different land cover types were used to discriminate evergreen forests from other land cover types during the key phenology phase. Considering the effects of mixing pixels caused by outside factors such as clouds, shadows, fragments, the minimum and maximum 3% were selected from 30-m Landsat NDVI, EVI, and LSWI time-series data of different land cover types [3]. This strategy was also used for analysis of the key phenology phase for extracting tropical evergreen forests.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Identifying the Key Phenology Phase,2
1088,"To extract tropical evergreen forests, high-quality Landsat 5 TM images captured on Julian Date 45 in 2010 were selected during the key phenology phase identified through analysis of MODIS annual time series. NDVI, EVI, and LSWI of evergreen forests, rubber plantations, farmlands, built-lands, and water bodies were extracted from Regions of Interests (ROIs) (Table 1) created from geo-referenced field photos and Google Earth high resolution images. These vegetation indices were evaluated by a statistical method to find an index combination with an ability to distinguish tropical forests from other land cover types.This study’s workflow for mapping tropical evergreen forests and exploring the spatial distribution is shown in Figure 2. First, annual time-series from 500-m MODIS images were analyzed to identify the key phenology phase; second, during the phenology phase, differences in 30-m Landsat NDVI, EVI, and LSWI of five typical land cover types were evaluated to select and determine the indices and relevant thresholds for extracting tropical evergreen forests; third, a 30-m map of tropical evergreen forest of the study area in 2010 was generated according to the indices and their thresholds determined above; fourth, the resultant map was verified using geo-referenced field photos and Google Earth high resolution imagery, and compared with MODIS MCD12Q1 land cover map for 2010; finally, the spatial distribution of evergreen forests at different elevation gradients was assessed based on a 90-m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the study area.", 2.

1089,"Tropical evergreen forests can be distinguished from farmlands, built-lands, and water bodies on MODIS NDVI, EVI, and LSWI annual time series between Julian Dates 20 and 120 (Figure 3), so this time period was selected as the key phenology phase to extract evergreen forests. During this phase, the evergreen forest NDVI, EVI, and LSWI are higher than all other land cover types based on Landsat 5 TM images. This is because those evergreen forests have a strong ability to resist low air temperature in winter and spring (Julian Dates between 20 and 120), and the NDVI, EVI, and LSWI are relatively high. In addition, deciduous rubber plantations have a low canopy cover due to leaf-off conditions, and farmlands are not being cultivated at this time of year either.", 3. Results, 3.1. MODIS-Based Time-Series Analyses for Different Land Cover Types,3
1090,"NDVI of tropical evergreen forests is higher than deciduous rubber plantations, farmlands, built-lands, and water bodies, and LSWI is lower than water bodies and higher than farmlands, rubber plantations, and built-lands, respectively (Table 2). However, the evergreen forest EVI is prone to mix with rubber plantations and farmlands. Therefore, Landsat 5 TM NDVI and LSWI were selected as the index metrics to extract tropical evergreen forests in the study area. Formulas (4)–(6) were designed to calculate thresholds of NDVI and LSWI. Since NDVI of tropical evergreen forests is far higher than other land cover types, just the minimum NDVI value needs to be calculated by formula (4), and the LSWI minimum and maximum can be calculated by formula (5) and (6). According to this, the thresholds are defined as NDVI ≥ 0.670 and 0.447 ≥ LSWI ≥ 0.222.

Here, NDVI, EVI, and LSWI were respectively extracted from Landsat 5 TM on Julian Date 45 in 2010.

Subscript and superscript letters stand for relevant minimum and maximum values of NDVI, EVI, and LSWI; r, e, c, w, and r separately stand for values of different land cover types, and d, ed, cd, and wd for their relevant standard deviation. Figure 4 shows the statistical comparison of 30-m Landsat 5 TM NDVI, EVI, and LSWI of five typical land cover types. NDVI and LSWI are able to discern tropical evergreen forests from other land cover types, whereas EVI is unable to do so.", 3. Results, 3.2. Selection of Indices and Relevant Thresholds,3
1091,"The output evergreen forest map (Figure 5) was verified by using the photo-interpreted locations described in the methods. To assess the map’s accuracy a confusion matrix [11] was created. The samples included evergreen forests and other typical land cover types. According to the confusion matrix (Table 3), the overall accuracy is 92%; the user’s and producer’s accuracy of evergreen forests are 91% and 89% separately, and the accuracy of the other land cover types is 93% and 94%, respectively.The spatial distribution of tropical evergreen forests in the output map for 2010 fits well to the false color (bands 5/4/3) composite Landsat 5 TM images-Julian Date 45 in 2010 (Figure 6). Furthermore, the resultant map (Figure 7B) was overlaid with the evergreen forests from the 500-m MODIS MCD12Q1 in 2010 (Figure 7A). The evergreen forest area of the Landsat-based output map is smaller than the one obtained from MODIS MCD12Q1. The possible reason for this is that mixed pixels are found due to the coarse spatial resolution and complex tropical mountain environment. For instance, some old rubber plantations have the similar phenology characteristics with evergreen forests and are misclassified.", 3. Results, 3.3. Landsat-Based Tropical Evergreen Forest Map of the Study Area in 2010,3
1092,"The distribution of tropical evergreen forests of the resultant map was analyzed by resampled 30-m DEM of the study area (Figure 8). The results show that tropical evergreen forests are majorly distributed in a narrow elevation range between 900 m and 1400 m, and few forest patches are found in lower (<900 m) and higher elevations (>1400 m).", 3.

1093,"The results from this study reinforces the notion that fine temporal resolution annual time series (eight-day MODIS) are capable of distinguishing the key phenology phase to extract tropical evergreen forests in tropical regions. These time-series can provide abundant and highly-reliable basic scientific data. In this particular case, it was established that the phenology phase can be identified from Julian Dates 20–120, and that this important phenological signature can be effectively used to extract tropical evergreen forests through analysis of NDVI, EVI, and LSWI of different land cover types. In tropical regions, cloud-free observations are difficult to get due to frequent clouds and shadows. Nevertheless, having coarser spatial resolution with high-temporal-resolution sensors can increase the possibility of getting good quality remote sensing images. This approach takes advantages of the high-revisit characteristics of the MODIS sensor, which increase the possibility of capturing good quality images from optical sensors. Annual MODIS time-series have been used in previous research [3,12,31,32,33], and most of them are not in tropical mountainous regions. It should be mentioned, however, that the coarse spatial resolution (500 m) may produce some inaccurate results from mixing pixels of small-area land cover types, such as narrow rivers.Distinguishing tropical evergreen forest and deciduous forest is a challenge in Southeast Asia based on optical remote sensing images. The phenology-based method used in several studies is very useful for mapping paddy rice fields [17] and rubber plantations [11]. In this study, the key phenology phase was used to distinguish tropical evergreen forests in mountainous regions. Vegetation in different growth stages exhibits various distinct characteristics in terms of forms, color, and shape. Spectral reflectance characteristics of different land cover types are similar in some phases and different in others. For instance, as it was shown in this paper, annual time-series MODIS NDVI of evergreen forests is higher than other land cover types on Julian Dates between 20 and 120 (Figure 3). Based on this finding, evergreen forests were distinguished from other land cover types in tropical mountainous regions based on 30-m Landsat 5 TM images. This study demonstrates that highly-temporal time-series are useful in observing key phenology phase for mapping a certain land cover type in certain time periods in tropical humid regions.The vegetation indices and related thresholds were keys for accurately mapping evergreen forests. Easy to carry out and to understand statistical methods are often used to choose indices and compute related threshold values based on samples of different land cover types. At present, there is a lack of efficient methods for choosing indices and computing related thresholds for quickly and efficiently distinguishing evergreen forests in tropical regions of Southeast Asia. This study found that 30-m Landsat NDVI and LSWI are two efficient indices for distinguishing evergreen forests in these tropical environments. A general method (formulae (4)–(6)) for calculating related thresholds by a statistical method has been described and provided in this paper. Thirty-meter Landsat NDVI and LSWI are two effective metrics (NDVI ≥ 0.670 and 0.447 ≥ LSWI ≥ 0.222) to discern tropical evergreen forests for inventories from other land cover types during the key phenology phases in tropical complex mountainous regions. In the past few decades, driven by urban and economic developments, tropical forests were substantially converted to farmlands and rubber plantations in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan China. However, an accurate spatial distribution of the remaining forests was hard to determine in this region. This study generated an accurate evergreen forest map (Figure 5) of the study area and explored the forests’ distribution across an elevation gradient (Figure 8). It was found that evergreen forest is mainly distributed in a very narrow range (900 m–1400 m) of elevation. A possible reason for this is that farmlands and plantations mainly dominate the low-elevation regions, and the high-elevation regions are cultivated for planting economic crops such as tea plants. This may lead to the loss of vertical forest diversity and biodiversity, and threatens the local ecosystem, biodiversity, and environment. This implies that these ecosystems are susceptible to a land cover transition, thus local governments need to take action for their protection. In this paper, a phenology-based automated mapping algorithm was shown to perform well in tropical mountainous regions. The study explored the extent, areas, and spatial distribution of tropical evergreen forest in this region of South Asia, and evaluated the efficiency and applicability of the method.Additionally, samples created from geo-referenced photos and high resolution images of Google Earth provide reliable basic data for algorithm training and result validation. These geo-referenced filed photos are firstly transferred into xml files and then linked with high resolution imagery of Google Earth, in which samples are visually and interactively created.", 4.

1094,"This study attempted to develop a novel phenology-based method to map tropical evergreen forests by integrating 30-m Landsat and eight-day 500-m MODIS remotely sensed images during a key phenology phase. The developed and verified protocol is simple yet effective. Integration of multi-source remote sensing data with different spatial and temporal resolutions proved satisfactory to obtain accurate estimates of the extent, areas, and spatial distribution of tropical evergreen forest in Southeast Asia. Additionally, identification of the key phenology phase is very important to distinguish evergreen forest from other land cover types based on vegetation indices including NDVI, EVI, and LSWI. The assessment of the spatial distribution of evergreen forest across the elevation gradient showed that the remaining forest is fragmented and needs to be protected. Additionally, the study suggests that the local government can compensate farmers to encourage them to farm in low-elevation gradients and to withdraw from ecosystem-weak regions in high-elevation gradients, for example, by establishing guidelines for planting rubber trees below 950 m. This study also illustrates that our output map can provide more detailed and accurate spatial information than MODIS MCD12Q1. However, there are still some uncertainties in the methods due to the relatively coarse temporal and spatial resolution of remote sensing data and the influence of frequent clouds, shadows, and aerosols. The integration with other sources (such as microwave, lidar, and optical) with finer spatial and temporal resolution may be tested in future studies to improve the presented methods for the extraction of tropical evergreen forests.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
1095,"Forests provide multiple ecosystem services at various spatial scales and constitute an important sink of sequestered atmospheric carbon [1,2]. Carbon stocks are an important input in climate models, and responsible forest management is a way to mitigate the impact of global climate change [3]. Accurate and consistent estimation of AGB can help to reduce current uncertainties regarding carbon fluxes [4,5]. Several methods exist for calculating AGB, these range from destructive methods to satellite-based estimations. Estimation can be improved by combining multiple approaches [6,7].Traditionally, forest AGB and carbon stocks have been assessed by measuring tree dimensions in permanent field plots and then using allometric equations (e.g., [8,9]). In recent years, we have seen a move toward remote sensing as the primary tool for monitoring forest AGB and carbon stocks (e.g., [10]). The rapid development of laser scanning systems is making them great tools for estimating tree heights and forest biomass [11,12]. Airborne laser scanning (ALS), in particular, has been established as a standard technology for high-precision three-dimensional topographic data acquisition [13]. It has a powerful penetrating ability and can obtain vertical structure information for forests, thereby improving accuracy in estimating forest height and structure [14,15]. ALS is mostly operated in form of small-footprint discrete-return or waveform systems and allows for estimating AGB using area-based or individual tree detection approaches [16,17,18,19,20]. Because remote sensing-based AGB estimates are nevertheless indirect, high quality and large quantities of traditional field inventory data and AGB destructive sampling are still needed.AGB estimates for both approaches depend upon canopy characteristics, such as tree branching and foliage structure, because these elements intercept laser pulses in various canopy height layers. Consequently, the accuracy of ALS-based AGB models can vary by species and forest types [21]. Bouvier et al. [22] demonstrated, that plot size significantly impacted AGB model performance within pine forest in southwestern France. The accuracy of ALS-based models can potentially vary with the ALS data point density. For instance, Montagnoli et al. [23] investigated the utility of low-density ALS data (<2 pt/m2) for estimating AGB within mixed broad-leaved forest in Italy. Wu et al. [24] reported an overall decreasing trend in error of ALS-derived AGB estimates as LiDAR point density increased from 0.5 to 8 pt/m2 within forested landscape in east-central Arizona. Brovkina et al. [25] used high point density LiDAR data (50 pt/m2) for AGB estimation within mixed spruce and beech forest in the Czech Republic.The main objective of this study is to obtain deeper insight into variables that influence estimation of aboveground biomass from ALS data. Specifically, we will evaluate (i) the effect of various ALS point densities and spatial resolutions of input canopy height model rasters on individual tree detection, and (ii) the impact and transferability of site-specific relationships between tree height and stem diameter at breast height (DBH) on estimates of Norway spruce forest AGB in the Czech Republic. The first part of our study should provide suggestions which ALS data to choose for operational AGB estimation. The second part should fill a gap in assessment of uncertainty in AGB estimates caused by usage of allometric equation from different sources as this issue is rarely addressed in scientific literature.", 1. Introduction,None,1.

The catchments are part of the GEOMON network that was established primarily to study long-term effects of decreasing acid depositions on the recovery of forested ecosystems, and on soil and water chemistry. Field observations was begun in 1994 [26,27]. The catchments are predominantly covered by productive forests of Norway spruce (Picea abies L. Karst) and they represent a large variety of environmental conditions in the Czech Republic. Catchments’ characteristics are summarized in Table 1, and further details are provided by Oulehle et al. [27].In addition to the sites from the GEOMON network, we also used forest inventory data from another site to test the impact of local allometric equations on AGB estimation. That external site, known as Bílý Kříž, is located in a mountainous area near the Czech Republic and Slovakia borders within the Moravian-Silesian Beskydy Mountains (49°30′N, 18°32′E, 800 to 920 m a.s.l.). It is an experimental research site for long-term monitoring of CO2 and energy fluxes of a Norway spruce forest monoculture (40 years old in 2018) and, as such, it is included into Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS). Site characteristics are reported in Table 1. Hereinafter, this site is referred to as “BK” and allometric equations computed for this site are labeled as “outside”.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1. Study Sites,2
1097,"Field data (i.e., tree species identification, stem diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), crown radius (R), height to crown base and crown completeness) were measured at the GEOMON sites during the 2015 vegetation season and in the case of NAZ during 2016. These parameters were recorded for all trees with DBH greater than 5 cm within a circular plot of 500 m2 (r = 12.6 m). In total, 81 forest inventory plots were sampled and the numbers of plots varied between 5 and 10 per catchment according to the area of each. Selection of the plots followed stratified random sampling, where strata were determined based on forest management maps, as well as local soil and orography conditions. The center of each plot was recorded using differential GPS with a horizontal accuracy of about 1 m. Mean values of the measured tree parameters per catchment are summarized in Table 2.Field measurements for H and DBH of Norway spruce trees at the external site Bílý Kříž are recorded differently than at the GEOMON sites. This dataset contains H and DBH measurements that have been recorded in every vegetation season since 1997 for all trees with DBH > 2.0 cm growing within a fenced area (i.e., 290 trees measured in 2017, details in Table 2).Field measurements of tree parameters were primarily used to construct empirical models (so-called allometric equations), which were either specific for each GEOMON catchment (local models) or for all catchments together (global models) or for the external site (outside models). The first set of allometric equations was established between R and H using a linear model (Equation (1)):

Estimates of R were used to tune a tree detection algorithm (described in Section 2.4). The second set of allometric equations was established between DBH and H using an exponential model (Equation (2), further labeled as local1, global1, or outside1) and a power model (Equation (3), further labeled as local 2, global 2, or outside 2):

DBH estimates were used to compute a single tree biomass and subsequently forest AGB.The allometric equations (Equations (1)–(3)) were established for two tree species: the dominant Norway spruce and less abundant European beech. The spruce models were applied to all other coniferous trees found in our study sites. The allometric equation for European beech was created only as a global model, as there was not enough data for site-specific local models. The beech global model was applied to all other deciduous trees found in our study sites.Before the allometric equations were constructed, the input field data were harmonized such that a comparable number of samples was selected across all catchments and all tree height categories. In the first step, all dead and broken trees were removed from the forest inventory database. In the second step, we used stratified random sampling to eliminate the influence of tree height distribution. The remaining trees were assigned into height categories at 5 m intervals (<5 m, 5–10 m, 10–15 m, etc.). From each height category, n samples were randomly selected (n = 20 for spruce local allometric equations, n = 40 for spruce global equations, n = 100 for spruce local equation established for Bílý Kříž, and n = 20 for beech global equation). According to Sullivan et al. [28], stratified sampling should produce smaller prediction error for larger sample pools. In the third step, the models (Equations (1)–(3)) were fitted to input data and outlying samples were removed based on 95% confidence interval of these preliminary models. Final models were constructed then by fitting Equations (1)–(3) to the cleaned data. The quality of the models was assessed by root mean square error (RMSE) computed between the predicted (P) and observed (O) values:

1098,"Airborne laser scanning data for 11 GEOMON sites (Table 2) were acquired during August 2017. ALS data were recorded using a Riegl LMS—Q780 scanner on board Flying Laboratory of Imaging Systems [29] that is operated by the Global Change Research Institute CAS (CzechGlobe). ALS data were recorded at two nominal pulse densities: 4 pulses per m2 (flight altitude at 1000 m above the ground level, further labeled as 1000 AGL) and 2 pulses per m2 (flight altitude at 2000 m above the ground level, further labeled as 2000 AGL). For larger catchments, the pulse densities were doubled due to 50% overlap between flight lines. Moreover, because the Riegl system allows for multiple echo recording, the real point cloud densities varied between 8 and 18 pt/m2 for datasets acquired at 1000 AGL and between 4 and 8 pt/m2 for datasets acquired at 2000 AGL.Pre-processing of the raw ALS data encompassed full-waveform decomposition and georeferencing in RiProcess software (RIEGL GmbH) and exporting a point cloud in LAS format after a strip adjustment. In the next step, the point clouds were transformed into a canopy height model (CHM) raster. The CHM calculation included noise removal, ground filtering, and rasterization using the LAStools software package (Rapidlasso GmbH) and the approach reported by Khosravipour [30] to create a pit-free CHM. In total, four CHMs were prepared for each catchment (i.e., rasters with pixel sizes 0.5 m and 1.0 m for 1000 AGL and 2000 AGL data, respectively).Because the assessment of ALS input data properties (point density and CHM pixel size) on tree detection and AGB estimates was part of this study, the ALS input datasets were compared at the level of point clouds and at the level of CHM first. We computed histograms for height distribution and descriptive statistics for the entire catchment area and per forest inventory plot.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Airborne Laser Scanning Data,2
1099,"Individual tree detection and estimation of tree H is a prerequisite step for AGB estimation. The individual tree detection was executed for four CHMs per catchment and furthermore expanded by two scenarios to evaluate the effect of local and global models estimating tree crown R. In total eight tree detection results were generated for each catchment. The tree detection algorithm is based on previous work of Novotný [31], and it was further extended and modified in this study. It is fully automated and implemented in Python. The algorithm requires several parameters to be specified by a user to optimize results of the tree detection. Parameter selection and description of basic steps in the algorithm are as follow:Identification of local maxima in CHM.Applying a forest mask to remove those local maxima that were not classified as trees. (We used a mask of coniferous, broadleaf, and non-forested areas that was prepared from airborne hyperspectral images acquired simultaneously with ALS. For the sake of brevity, this was not described in the methods section.)Removal of those local maxima lower than a certain threshold

.)Export to a point shapefile.Accuracy of the individual tree detection could not be assessed by means of direct comparison with measured tree positions as these had not been recorded during the field surveys. Therefore, we selected six validation plots (50 × 50 m) from our ALS data and identified individual tree positions in the point cloud manually (hereafter termed reference trees). Each validation plot was located in a different catchment and these represented a variety of forest types in terms of mean tree height. Two plots represented forests with mean tree height less than 15 m, two plots were selected for mean tree height between 15 and 25 m, and the last two were selected for mean tree height greater than 25 m. Trees from manual and automated detections were paired by searching the closest neighborhood of our reference trees (in case of CHM with pixel size 0.5 m the maximum distance of three pixels was searched; in case of CHM with pixel size 1.0 m the maximum distance was two pixels). For each validation plot we computed detection, omission, and commission rates.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.4. Individual Tree Detection and Its Verification,2
1100,"Total AGB (computed as sum of its components including stems, branches, leaves) was computed according to equations established by Wirth et al. [32] for Norway spruce and by Wutzler et al. [33] for European beech and other deciduous tree species. All equations for AGB computation were chosen in their simplest forms, using DBH as the only input variable (summarized in Table 3).The DBH field measurements were used directly to compute AGB for each field-surveyed plot and subsequently scaled up to represent the entire catchment area (further labeled as “field-based AGB”). The results of individual tree detection with the estimates of tree H from ALS were used to retrieve DBH first and then compute ALS-based estimates of AGB. We used six models for DBH recalculation from ALS-based tree H (local 1 and 2, global 1 and 2, outside 1 and 2). In combination with two input point cloud densities, two CHM pixel sizes, and two allometric equations predicting R from H (local and global), we had 48 scenarios for assessing the effect of different parameters.The ALS-based AGB estimates were cross-compared between the scenarios and compared with the field-based results. The actual variable to be compared is AGB in tons per hectare of forest. We calculated this value for field data as the sum of AGB for individual trees divided by plot size times the percentage of forest cover. The mean value computed from all plots was taken as an estimate of AGB per catchment. We calculated AGB per plot from ALS data as the sum of individual trees inside a circle with an area of 1000 m2 around the plot center divided by the area times the percentage of forest cover. The decision to double the plot size (1000 for ALS vs. 500 for field) should minimize inaccuracies in geometric position (field GPS vs. aircraft IMU accuracy). We calculated AGB per catchment from ALS data as the sum of all individual trees divided by area of catchment times the percentage of forest cover. The forest cover was estimated from ALS point clouds and publicly available orthophoto maps using Google Earth to visually check differences in forest cover between 2015 and 2017.Comparison between the ALS-based scenarios and with the field-based results was evaluated using linear fit, R2, and RMSE. Additionally, we evaluated dispersion of points around the 1:1 line and computed 1:1 error as:

1101,"The 11 small forested catchments from the GEOMON network used in this study represented broad regional variability in Norway spruce dominated forest stands. Field data were used to establish allometric equations to predict tree crown R and stem DBH from tree H. All allometric equations are summarized in Table 4. Only a simple linear model was tested for the tree crown R. Two models, the exponential (Equation (2)) and the power (Equation (3)) models, were tested for predicting stem DBH from tree H. Figure 3 shows examples of allometric equations used in spruce DBH estimation for two local sites (LYS and BK) and the global model for spruce and beech trees (graphs with the local allometric equations for all other sites are presented in the Supplementary Material S1).The allometric equation for tree crown R estimation from tree H is important in our algorithm for individual tree detection from ALS data. However, as this relationship has scarcely any practical use in forest management, it is difficult to find reliable data or existing models in the scientific literature. Therefore, this linear relationship was determined solely from our available field data, with RMSE varying between 0.268 and 0.657 m for local models and equal to 0.553 m for the global model. Its use in tree detection is further discussed in Section 3.3, but, as the detection rates with the global model were generally higher for all tree height categories, we can consider the global model to be more robust and to slightly outperform the local models.In forestry practice, the relationship between stem DBH and tree H is generally reported as H = f(DBH) and mathematically expressed using various models, including power, exponential, hyperbolic, and others [34]. For the purpose of AGB estimation from ALS, however, the reverse form of DBH = f(H) is required. Simple mathematical inversion is not always feasible, though, due to the asymptotic nature of the published models. Thanks to our own field data collected for a large variety of spruce trees, we could test two mathematical models: the exponential and power expression. RMSE of the exponential model varied between 2.499 and 4.654 m and RMSE of the power model varied between 2.624 and 4.983 m. Although for most of the catchments the exponential model resulted in lower RMSE than did the power model, for biomass estimation, the exponential model seemed to be more sensitive to tree H. For tall trees, therefore, it could yield unrealistic (too high) estimates of DBH and thus of AGB (further discussed in Section 3.4).", 3. Results and Discussions, 3.1. Allometric Equations,3
1102,"Before the AGB estimation from the ALS data, we evaluated differences between two ALS input datasets with different point densities (1000 AGL, 2000 AGL). We compared histograms for height distributions extracted from point clouds, as well as from CHM rasters, for the entire catchment area and for each forest inventory plot. Figure 4 shows an example from the CER catchment (for brevity’s sake, the other sites are not presented). The histograms are not identical for point clouds and CHMs because the point cloud data contain all points (including multiple returns from the canopy profile), whereas the CHM rasters refer only to the top-of-canopy layer. Height distribution in CHM with 1 m resolution tends to be slightly shifted to the right compared to CHM with resolution 0.5 m. This is because the rasterization technique we used lays just one 1m pixel over a bunch of points instead of four 0.5 m pixels, which makes the tree tops (and crown borders) less sharp.Comparison at the level of point clouds and CHM rasters showed very similar canopy height distributions across all the sites. Therefore, we could assume that the point densities of the ALS input data (1000 AGL vs. 2000 AGL) will likely not affect the results of individual tree detection and tree height estimation.", 3. Results and Discussions, 3.2. Comparison of ALS Input Data,3
1103,"Results of tree detection were obtained for eight scenarios combining four CHMs (pixel size 0.5 and 1.0 m, point density from 1000 AGL and 2000 AGL) and two allometric equations for tree crown R estimation. Results from the automated tree detection were verified for six validation squares distributed across three tree height categories (more precisely, located within ANE, CER, LIZ, PLB, UDL, and UHL catchments). In each case, detection and commission rates were computed for each tree height category and for all validation plots together (Figure 5). We achieved detection rates from 0.75 to 0.90, which is in line with other studies. For instance, Luo et al. [35] reported overall accuracy of 0.87 for comparison between automatically segmented trees and visual examination in Tahoe National Forest (USA). Wang et al. [7] reported R2 of 0.8–0.9 for comparison of plot-level field-based and ALS-based tree counts in Heihe River Basin (China).Almost no differences in detection and commission rates were found between the results obtained from the ALS data of different point densities (1000 AGL, 2000 AGL). This had been expected after comparison of the ALS input data (Figure 4, Section 3.2). Similar conclusions had been reached by Bouvier et al. (2019), who reported almost no influence of ALS pulse densities (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 pulses per m2) on metrics derived for AGB estimation in a pine forest.Pixel size of the input CHM raster had a stronger effect on tree detection. Detection rates varied between 0.78 and 0.90 for the CHM with 0.5 m pixel size, and lower values between 0.55 and 0.79 were found for the CHM with 1.0 m pixel size. On the contrary, higher commission rates (0.17–0.39) were found for the CHM with 0.5 m pixel size and lower values for the CHM with 1.0 m pixel size (0.05–0.19). Higher detection rates were found for the global model when we quantified the effect of global vs. local allometric equation used to estimate tree crown R in the tree detection phase.Detection rates also varied between the tree height categories. Detection rates in forests with tree height below 15 m were lowest, whereas those rates for forests with tree height above 25 m were highest. Similar results had been found by Kaartinen et al. [36], who analyzed accuracies of tree detection from ALS data with point densities of 2, 4 and 8 pt/m2 in Southern Finland forests with prevailing Scots pine, Norway spruce, and silver birch. The best accuracy was observed for taller trees. For the local maxima method, the RMSE in tree location was estimated as 1.2 m, 0.7 m, and 0.5 m for tree height classes 10–15 m, 15–20 m, and >20 m, respectively.From the point of view of the final AGB product, the effect of tree detection omission and commission errors compensated one another to some extent. We saw this especially in the tree height category 15–25 m with the local model and in the tree height category 25–35 m with the global model. One more interaction worth noting is that underestimating of the tree count can be compensated by an overestimation of the DBH model, thus ending up with a false agreement between field- and ALS-based AGB totals. This happened in our case with CHMs having 1.0 m pixel size.Based on the results of the tree detection we eliminated half of our scenarios. For AGB assessment, we retained only the results of tree detection from CHM with pixel size of 0.5 m from 1000 AGL.", 3. Results and Discussions, 3.3. Tree Detection,3
1104,"AGB at plot level and at entire catchment level was computed for 12 scenarios using as input the CHM raster with pixel size 0.5 m from 1000 AGL. The 12 scenarios considered two allometric equations for tree crown R estimation and six allometric equations for tree stem DBH estimation (the power and the exponential local, global, and outside models).Intercomparison between field-based and ALS-based AGB estimates at plot level is summarized for all scenarios in Table 5. RMSE between field- and ALS-based estimates varied between 93 and 171 t/ha (if we omit two outstanding scenarios with exceptionally high RMSE > 326 t/ha). In general, we can conclude that all ALS-based scenarios overestimated AGB especially for plots with taller trees and higher biomass in comparison with the field-based estimates. ALS-based AGB estimation derived using local allometric equations for both crown radius and DBH was the scenario with best precision as expressed by steep slope (1.054) and low offset (8.561) in linear fit which was also the tightest (R2 = 0.667, RMSE = 93 t/ha). All the plots of all three height classes were evenly distributed around the 1:1 line, which is expressed by the lowest value of 1:1 error equal to 0.264 (see Figure 6, and we refer our readers to the Supplementary Material S2 to see the same figure for the other scenarios).Two comparisons between ALS-based estimates are presented in Figure 7. Both graphs show AGB estimates using the local allometric equations for both crown R and stem DBH vs. global allometric equations, but the two plots show difference by equation type (exponential vs. power type). Most plots differed within the range of

.Total AGB estimates for the entire catchment areas under 12 scenarios using ALS data are summarized in Table 6. Comparison between the field- and ALS-based AGB estimates is presented in Figure 8 for two contrasting scenarios, one using the local allometric equations, the other one using only the global equations. Figures for the other scenarios are presented in the Supplementary Material S3.Forest AGB (as estimated from the R:local, DBH:local 2 scenario) varied between 119 and 398 t/ha according to forest stand age. For example, the lowest AGB was observed at the UDL and UHL sites with mean forest age between 20 and 40 years. In general, global DBH models tend to underestimate AGB in young stands and overestimate AGB in mature stands. This will likely remain true despite the fact that there might be some differences between field- and ALS-based estimates because of the two year gap between the data acquistion. We assume that yearly increment in AGB is not very high (less than 10% for younger stands and less than 5% for mature stands). An exception was seen in the PLB catchment, where AGB was underestimated every time. We know that there was a logging activity between 2015 and 2017 at that site. Furthermore, specific bedrock chemistry (alkaline serpentinite, see Table 1) suppress tree growth due to nutrient imbalance [37] leading to shorter trees with the same DBH compared to other sites.We achieved linear fit between field-based and ALS-based AGB estimate at catchment level varying from 0.822 to 0.673 in terms of R2 and from 40 to 90 t/ha in terms of RMSE. ALS-based AGB estimation derived using local allometric equations for both crown R and stem DBH had the greatest precision as expressed by steep slope (a = 0.928) and low offset (b = 11.205) in linear fit which was also the tightest (R2 = 0.822, RMSE = 40 t/ha). Our results are in agreement with those from other studies, such as that of Mutwiri et al. [17], who reported R2 of 0.7–0.8 in comparing field- and ALS-based AGB estimates within montane forest in Kenya. Similar levels of accuracy were reported by Shao et al. [20], with R2 of 0.6 for AGB estimates in Yellowwood State Forest (USA), and Wang et al. [7] reporting R2 of 0.6–0.8 for estimates in Heihe River Basin (China). Ferraz et al. [18] analyzed differences between field- and ALS-based AGB estimates for different forest types and reported highly variable results with R2 ranging between 0.37 and 0.99.Based on the results presented in Table 6 it is clear that the exponential local allometric equation (type 1) for DBH estimation that was established outside the GEOMON catchments produces unrealistic estimates of AGB, especially for sites with mature and tall spruce trees. This could be expected, because the dataset at the Bílý Kříž site contains data only for spruce trees younger than 40 years. Therefore, the allometric equation for DBH estimation, especially the exponential model, is scarcely transferable to older trees. If we remove the results for the “outside 1” model from Table 6, we are able to assess uncertainty or variability in AGB estimation from the remaining scenarios. The uncertainty (measured as standard deviation) in AGB estimates varies from 16 t/ha (observed at catchment CER) up to 84 t/ha (observed at catchment POM). In relative values, it goes from 6% to 37% of the field-based AGB estimation per catchment. Similarly, Bellan et al. [38] reported underestimation of 10% in total AGB when transferring field-based allometric equations AGB = f(DBH) from one spruce stand in the Czech Republic to another.", 3. Results and Discussions, 3.4. Biomass Estimation,3
1105,"This study explored variables influencing estimation of AGB for Norway spruce dominated forests from ALS data. Specifically, we looked at the influence of ALS data point densities and spatial resolution of corresponding CHM for individual tree detection and role of allometric equations for tree crown radius and stem DBH estimation in forest AGB estimation. We conclude that variable point densities of ALS data (4–18 pt/m2) did not influence the results for individual tree detection. Therefore, we recommend using ALS data with point density around 5 pt/m2 for operational estimation of spruce forest AGB in the Central European region. Spatial resolution of the input CHM rasters had a greater impact on tree detection, higher detection rates were achieved for CHMs with pixel size 0.5 m than 1.0 m for all tree height categories.AGB estimation from ALS data is largely dependent on the allometric equations that estimate basic tree parameters, such as crown radius and stem diameter, from an easily retrievable tree height. In common forestry practice, these allometric equations often do not exist (such as for crown radius) or they are reported in inverse form (such as estimating tree height from stem diameter). Thanks to the large database of forest inventory parameters that was compiled for small forested catchments within the GEOMON monitoring network in the Czech Republic (about 3000 trees), we could establish our own allometric equations for Norway spruce and European beech. Because the GEOMON sites cover a broad variety of environmental conditions and spruce-dominated forests, we can consider the global allometric models to be representative for the Czech Republic, and potentially for the Central European region.We computed AGB at the catchment level for 12 scenarios with varying allometric equations and the results showed that uncertainty varied from 16 up to 84 t/ha. In relative values, it goes from 6% to 37% of the field-based AGB estimation per catchment. Therefore, allometric equations mainly for DBH estimation should be applied with care. We can recommend establishing one’s own site-specific models, but this requires investments into field data collection. Direct comparison between ALS-based AGB estimates using local and global models showed variation as much as 20% (both positive and negative) for the highest tree height class and as much as 50% for the lowest tree height class.The main advantages of the ALS-based approach for estimating forest AGB are full spatial coverage and an ability to detect real spatial distribution of trees whereas field-based estimation relies on a limited number of sampling plots and requires extrapolation to the stand level.", 4. Conclusions,None,4
1106,"Development of remote sensing technologies have facilitated the ability to rapidly capture 3D data containing vegetation structural information [1,2]. Accurate measurement of vegetation at different spatial and temporal scales is critical in informing a range of ecological and natural resource management disciplines [3,4,5]. Estimates of vegetation characteristics such as canopy height, canopy cover, diameter at breast height, and above-ground biomass have been identified as important metrics for carbon accounting, wildlife habitat diversity, precision forestry, fire behaviour modelling and understory forest dynamics for eco-hydrological monitoring [6,7,8,9,10].Data capture from above the canopy (satellite, aircraft or drone) is the most common approach to characterising the 3D structure of forests [11,12,13,14]. Known limitations in observing detailed below canopy structure from airborne sensors have led to investigation into terrestrial data capture [7,15,16]. The two methods that have been used previously for capturing 3D information describing forests are laser scanning and image-based point clouds [17]. Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS) is a ground based-remote sensing technique which utilises the time for a laser pulse emitted from the sensor to reflect off a target and return to the sensor to provide a precise range to that target [18]. Combining this range information with the direction the laser was emitted allows for the 3D location of the target to be determined relative to the sensor [18]. The speed of operation of modern TLS allows for multiple points to be collected rapidly and accurately [19]. TLS point clouds have previously been used in the assessment of below-canopy forest characteristics in particular for examining stem properties; diameter at breast height, stem curve and species and allometry biomass [18,19,20,21]. More recently, fine scale vegetation characteristics have also been observed in the context of estimating biomass through allometry [1,16,22,23].Structure from Motion (SfM) is an image based technique which observes the same features, in multiple images, from different viewpoints to build a point cloud [24]. Prior research has utilised SfM point clouds derived from terrestrial and airborne images to estimate tree-centric characteristics such as canopy height and cover, diameter at breast height, and stem count [14]. Preliminary research using terrestrial SfM point clouds for measuring below canopy vegetation biomass has demonstrated strong correlation to direct measurements, visual assessments, and TLS point clouds in pasture and grassy dry forest environments [1,17,22,25,26,27]. However, limited research has been conducted to investigate the potential of these point clouds to represent fine-scale vegetation structure between the top intercept height and ground surface.With prior studies demonstrating potential for terrestrial point clouds for measuring below canopy vegetation, demonstration of the absolute accuracy and correlation to existing methods is seen as an important consideration for adoption on a wider-scale. Validation of point clouds have been largely focused on visual assessment and destructive harvesting to compare biomass estimates [1,16,19,22]. Whilst considered to be the most accurate form of volume assessment, manual collection and weighing is time-consuming, labour intensive and prohibits repeat-sampling [28,29]. Such approaches also only provide an indication of the vegetation volume across the measured area and need to be combined with other measurements to provide an indication of the vertical distribution of this volume [30,31]. Whilst being quick to execute, visual assessments have proven to be subjective and vary substantially between assessors in multiple environmental applications [25,32,33,34,35].Studies that have directly validated the representation of vegetation structure contained within terrestrial point clouds have utilised the point-intercept method [23,28,36,37,38]. The point-intercept method involves the use of a wooden or metal dowel placed at randomly or regular spaced intervals, with the height and type of vegetation measured at that point. This method of assessment has been used extensively for the measurement of vegetation characteristics in ecological studies [39,40,41,42] and shown to be highly correlated with the estimation of plant biomass [43]. A difficulty in using this technique is co-registering the point intercept observations to the point cloud for direct comparison. To achieve this several approaches have been trialled; Bright et al. [38], for example, used markers placed on the ground to establish a coordinate system. Whilst this approach is suitable in areas of low vegetation, accurately locating a point intercept sample in high vegetation cover would be difficult. Loudermilk et al. [28] and Hiers et al. [37] used styrofoam balls to co-register TLS point clouds with manual field measurements. Whilst this may be suitable for volumetric calculations utilising top height, characterisation of the structural content would be challenging to make due to the variation in coordinate systems.The use of laser pointers have been suggested to provide an alternative to using metal dowels to measure cover especially in studies where the phenomenon of interest is above head height [44,45,46,47]. Whilst this technique may provide a less destructive method of measuring vegetation top height due to minimal disturbance of the vegetation, obstruction from vegetation makes the use of lasers to measure vegetation impractical for measuring height of a complex surface and/or near-surface vegetation structures. The point-intercept method in combination with an appropriate sampling density has demonstrated to be an accurate form of vegetation structure assessment for measuring defined vegetation elements.The aforementioned studies demonstrate the capability of point cloud capture to provide a representative description of biomass volume relative to destructive sampled weight. What these approaches do not provide is an indication of the quality of the representation of the overall vegetation structure in the point cloud data. Limited research has been conducted in applying methods which directly validate vegetation structural characteristics contained in point clouds.The primary aim of this manuscript is to develop a method that allows the representation of understory vegetation structure contained within point clouds to be assessed. Two case studies were used to evaluate the performance of the method. The first case study highlighted the effect of the frame on the point cloud. The second case study highlighted how the methodology can be applied at sites that have a range of cover and height attributes. It is shown that the validation frame measurements provide a rigorous assessment for the relative performance of terrestrial point clouds generated using both TLS and SfM technology. The implications of the frame measurements to be used as an indicator for point cloud completeness at multiple stages of the point cloud processing workflow and its potential use across a wider range of environments are also discussed.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
1107,"One of the primary obstacles in the validation of point clouds based on data primitives (such as intercepts derived from the point intercept method) is the co-registration of the two sources of data. To achieve an accurate co-registration of validation and point cloud information, a frame was designed to register point intercept locations and allow point cloud information to be transformed into the same coordinate space.The frame consisted of a 0.5 m × 0.5 m quadrat on four variable height legs (Figure 1). The size of the frame developed in this study was chosen to align with similar practices in other ecological studies [48,49,50]. The origin of the coordinate system was the lower-left inner corner of the quadrat frame. The variable height legs allowed the frame to be levelled using a spirit level bubble approximately 1 m from the ground. A sliding rack was used to allow the collection of 8 point intercept measurements simultaneously along the x-axis. This rack could be located at eight locations along the y-axis, allowing a total of 64 measurement points to be measured at known locations within the coordinate system defined by the frame.At each measurement point, an aluminum rod of 0.6 cm diameter marked at 1 cm intervals was inserted into the rack to ground level. The rack was designed with two vertical bars spaced 5 cm apart to ensure when inserted the rods remain closely aligned to the z-axis with a maximum deviation of 2 cm. For each rod, the method outlined in [44] for taking point intercept measurements can be followed. This involved noting the height above ground, type, and width of any vegetation elements intercepting the rod. The height of the rod at the bottom of the second vertical bar was also observed to determine the location of the ground within the frame’s coordinate system.", 2. Materials and Method, 2.1. Validation Frame Design,2
1108,"The in-field use of the validation frame has been designed to work independently from the point cloud technology (i.e., TLS or SfM). As such, point clouds can be collected in the desired form with the frame placed in the area of observation at the time of capture. Following the point cloud capture, the point intercept reference measurements were taken. As rods are removed to change rack positions, minor disturbances to the vegetation may occur. The adopted best practice was therefore to capture the reference measurements at the end of the survey.", 2. Materials and Method, 2.2. Point Cloud Collection,2
1109,"This section describes how SfM and TLS point clouds were co-registered to the validation frame. These two approaches provided an indication as to how point clouds captured using emerging technologies can be co-registered to the frame. For TLS data, scale is an inherent property of the point cloud, thus, in this case, a six-parameter transformation (three translations and three rotations) of the point cloud relative to the frame was defined based on a set of common points. The common points between the two coordinate systems were defined by manual location of the outside edge of the quadrat in the TLS point cloud.For image based point clouds, point cloud information can be transformed to the frame coordinate system using known locations on the frame as control targets. This is achieved by locating each corner of the frame on four or more images. Once added, the 3D position is estimated in the arbitrary coordinate space using the SfM solution. A seven-parameter transformation (three translations, three rotations and one scale term) is then determined and applied to the point cloud.", 2. Materials and Method, 2.3. Co-Registration of Validation Measurements and Point Clouds,2
1110,"To directly compare the reference data to the point cloud in this study, each dataset was transformed into a binary voxel model indicating vegetation presence and absence. A voxel model for these purposes is a three-dimensional grid domain with the size of the grid cells determining the resolution of the 3D grid [51].For the reference data, the vertical resolution of the data can be considered to be 10 mm (due to the marks on the rod), while the horizontal resolution was determined to be 20 mm to allow for any slight deviations of the rods from z-axis. The conversion of the reference information to voxel space can achieved by indicating if an intersection occurred within a voxel. For the point cloud information, a similar conversion was achieved by counting the number points that fall within the 3D space defined by each voxel, the voxel can then be considered filled if the point count is greater than a count threshold.", 2. Materials and Method, 2.4. Voxelisation,2
1111,"The validation of the representation of vegetation within the point cloud can be achieved both on the raw data and on secondary metrics (such as vegetation cover and vegetation top height) based on the frame measurements. For validating the raw point cloud information, the presence or absence of voxel data can be directly compared. By determining the number of true and false positive and negatives, the completeness of the point cloud representation can be evaluated. A True Positive (TP) result indicates a point that was present in both the reference measurement and point cloud. A True Negative (TN) result highlights that a point was not present in both the point cloud and reference measurements. A False Negative (FN) indicates the presence of a reference measurement with no corresponding filled voxel. A False Positive (FP) indicates the presence of a filled voxel that does not correspond with a reference measurement. As there is likely to be a higher number of empty voxels in most environments, a Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC) was utilised to provide a measure of classification accuracy. This measure has been used previously in the application of point cloud analysis [52,53] to compare observed and predicted binary classifications where the classes are imbalanced [54]. The properties of the intercept can also be examined to determine the type and location of missing information in the point cloud. The error in intercept height can then be summarised using measures of difference such as Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) or Mean Absolute Deviation.The first step in extracting measurements of a vegetated scene from a point cloud is often the detection of points originating from the ground and the construction of a terrain model. The frame allows the accuracy of such ground definitions derived from point clouds to be assessed by comparing the terrain height at each measurement point to the frame measured height. Following the extraction of the ground, the point cloud can be normalised, which is achieved by subtracting the point’s raw height from the ground height at the location of the point. This provides the above-ground height of the vegetation. The accuracy of vegetation height is determined by comparing the normalised height from the point cloud, with a similar measure from the frame data. Point cloud data can also be normalised based on the definition of the ground provided by the frame measurements, allowing the influence of poor ground definition on vegetation metrics to be fully understood. Height metrics such as vegetation top height and vertical profiles can all be validated using this method. Similarly, percentage vegetation cover can be estimated based on the normalised point cloud. For instance, cover can be calculated based on the number of measurement points with an intercept or filled voxel above a height threshold.", 2. Materials and Method, 2.5. Metric Determination and Validation,2
1112,"Two independent case studies were conducted to assess the effectiveness of the validation frame in capturing structural information on fine scale vegetation. The first case study was designed to assess the impact of the validation frame on the resultant point cloud representation. This was done to ensure the validation approach did not bias the outcomes achievable from the point cloud technology. The second case study tested the validation frame in a variety of landscapes to assess the effectiveness of the frame at validating terrestrial point clouds in a variety of landscapes. This section first outlines the sensors used in both case studies, before providing details on plot setup, data capture and analysis, and closes with a discussion of the results undertaken within the case study. 2.6.1. Sensors TLS Data CollectionA Trimble TX8 scanner set to capture level two quality scans (resulting in a 11.3 mm point resolution at a distance of 30 m) was utilised for both case studies. For Case Study 1, four laser scans were captured approximately 3 m from the frame in order to specifically observe the effects of the frame on point cloud re-construction. For Case Study 2, the plots were scanned using the method outlined by Schaefer et al. [55], which involved collecting a central scan and four orthogonally located exterior scans taken approximately 10 m from the plot centre. Scans took approximately 3 min to capture and were co-registered using Trimble RealWorks 10.1, with automated alignment utilising the inbuilt cloud to cloud matching routine. Manual quality checking was conducted post-registration and adjustments were then undertaken if required. Image Based Data CollectionImages were collected using two consumer grade mirrorless cameras: an Olympus OM-D EM-10 camera and Sony Alpha 6000. Images were captured at approximately 2 m from the reference frame centre with a horizontal spacing or offset between each image of 0.3 m. This resulted in between 30 and 40 images being taken of the area within and around the reference frame. The height of the image capture varied: 1.0 m, 1.4 m and 1.8 m. Six downward looking images over the top of the frame were also captured to complete the image acquisition process.Images were collated and processed to form a point cloud using Agisoft Photoscan 1.4.0 (Agisoft LLC, Moscow, Russia). Images were aligned to generate a sparse point cloud using the high quality setting. The high quality setting and mild depth filtering was then applied to generate a dense point cloud. Point clouds were then clipped to represent the area of the reference frame with an approximate 1 m buffer. 2.6.2. Case Study 1: Effect of Frame on Point CloudThe purpose of the first case study was to determine whether the validation frame had any influence on the 3D reconstruction of vegetated scene when using either TLS or SfM techniques. To achieve this, scans and images were captured of two plots with understory vegetation in a built environment. The first plot had vegetation of approximately 0.1 m in height and covered 50% of the validation frame area. The second plot represented a more complex environment with the height of the vegetation approximately 0.5 m and covered 80% of the validation frame area. To fully validate the impact of the frame on representing vegetation, images and scans were captured firstly without the frame, then with the frame present, and finally with the frame removed again. Care was taken when placing and removing the frame to reduce disturbance to the vegetation inside the plot. Point Cloud Co-RegistrationWhen the frame was placed in the scene, point clouds were co-registered and transformed into voxel space using the approach outlined in Section 2.3. Without the frame in the scene, discrete features were identified in the already registered point clouds and used to provide the correct registration. To achieve this, the plots were carefully selected in built environments to provide an abundance discrete targets (brick corners, stairs and seat edges) identifiable within both the TLS and SfM point clouds. AnalysisFor assessing the impact on the presence of the validation frame on the point cloud, the area enclosed by the frame was extracted from point clouds captured both with and without the frame present. An assessment on the point cloud completeness was then conducted by comparing the point cloud with frame in place with the two point clouds without the frame. The analysis method outlined in Section 2.5 was then followed; however, in this case, the point cloud with the frame from each technology was used as the reference source. This allowed the differences in the point clouds with and without the frame to be quantified. 2.6.3. Case Study 2: ValidationThe purpose of the second case study was to implement the validation methodology developed in this paper, and to assess the effectiveness of SfM and TLS derived point clouds in detecting vegetation components at a fine scale.The study was undertaken within Australian forest landscapes. Sites located in Australia were chosen to provide a range of cover and structural characteristics for assessment in southeastern Australia. Site DescriptionsThe validation frame was tested in multiple environments tested to examine the frame’s ability to measure vegetation structure. The High Camp study site is situated in a heath dry forest near Kilmore, Victoria, Australia, approximately 80 km north of Melbourne (Figure 2). The overstory largely consisted of low, open eucalypt forest with an open crown cover. The understory consisted of sparse ericoid-leaved shrubs including heaths and peas. There was minimal surface litter and a range of exposed rock sections creating variable terrain.Royal Park is an urban parkland environment located in Parkville, Vic, Australia, 3 km north of Melbourne’s CBD (Figure 2). The overstory vegetation consisted of sparse Eucalypt trees, approximately 15 m tall. The understory consisted of a surface layer of coarse woody chips (e.g., tan bark) with some larger woody debris. Near-surface vegetation consisted of native shrubs with complex leaf arrangement.The Silvan1 site is located in moist forest near Monbulk, Vic, Australia, approximately 40 km to the east of Melbourne (Figure 2). This plot was located less than 50 m from Silvan Reservoir. There was also evidence of a planned burn occurring in the previous 5–10 years. The overstory largely consisted of medium to tall forests dominated by Eucalyptus obliqua and Eucalyptus radiata. The understory vegetation was dominated by native shrubs. The surface litter was measured at approximately 25 mm in height and consisted mostly of leaf litter with some woody debris. Near-surface vegetation was dominated by native shrubs.The Silvan2 site is similarly located to Silvan1, in moist forest near Monbulk, VIC, Australia (Figure 2). This plot was located at a higher elevation in comparison to the Silvan1 plot with no evidence of previous planned burn events. Increase in elevation along with a change in aspect produced varied vegetation to Silvan1. The overstory largely consisted of medium to tall forest dominated by Eucalyptus obliqua and Eucalyptus radiata. Understory vegetation was dense, with a high proportion of Aristia species. Surface litter was measured at approximately 25 mm and consisted mostly of leaf litter with some woody debris. Near-surface vegetation was dominated by native shrubs and aristida.The Ridgeway site was located in dry sclerophyll forest near Hobart, Tasmania, Australia (Figure 2). Evidence of a planned burn event (completed in 2015/2016) season was evident throughout the plot. The overstory of the plot consisted of Eucalyptus pulchella trees of varying age and ranging in height from 4.7 to 16.2 m. The understory of the plot consisted of low to medium height (0.5–2 m) shrubs and grasses. Surface litter mainly consisted of leafs and woody debris. Plot Set-OutFor all sites, at least one circular plot of 10 m radius was established. The centre of each plot was marked with a star picket or wooden stake. For each plot, two transects were established in opposing orthogonal directions. Along each transect, two validation frames were randomly located using random numbers chosen within 0–9 m and 11–20 m. Point Cloud FilteringPoint clouds generated using both SfM and TLS had filtering algorithms applied to reduce noise beneath the ground in the case of SfM, and to remove spurious points in the point cloud produced from the TLS scans [19,26]. Point Cloud NormalisationGround points were identified in both TLS and SfM point clouds using the Cloth Simulation Filter [56]. The settings for extracting the ground were optimised to obtain a set of parameters that would produce a ground surface across all plots and minimise RMSE against reference ground measurements (Table 1). A 0.02 m DTM was generated by constructing a Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) from the identified ground points. The height of the TIN facet at the centre of each cell is attributed to the DTM. TIN interpolation was used to ensure each point intercept sample had an associated ground height estimate. Next, the point cloud was normalised based on each point’s height above the TIN. This normalisation procedure provided a representation of the point cloud in relation to the ground. Data AnalysisTo assess the performance of TLS and SfM in comparison to the reference measurements, the point clouds were assessed for their ability to represent the first intercept (highest vegetation intercept). This assessment of point cloud completeness was undertaken on non-normalised point clouds to mitigate the influence of errors introduced due to the ground height estimates. Subsequently, all intercepts measured during the validation process were compared to the respective point clouds. Vegetation height and cover were calculated from both the reference measurement and derived voxel spaces. Cover is defined as the proportion of the validation frame area that has vegetation above 10 cm. In the context of the validation frame, this is defined as the number of rods for which one or more intercept was recorded above 10 cm divided by 64. Difference in cover were summarised as a single difference value for each frame, while differences in first intercept height within each frame were summarised using RMSE calculated as follows:

This allowed for identification of vegetation elements (absolute) and the effect of determining a ground surface in altering the vegetation representation in the point cloud (normalised).", 2.

The understory of the plot consisted of low to medium height (0.5–2 m) shrubs and grasses. Surface litter mainly consisted of leafs and woody debris.", 2. Materials and Method, Site Descriptions,2

1123,"Ground points were identified in both TLS and SfM point clouds using the Cloth Simulation Filter [56]. The settings for extracting the ground were optimised to obtain a set of parameters that would produce a ground surface across all plots and minimise RMSE against reference ground measurements (Table 1). A 0.02 m DTM was generated by constructing a Triangular Irregular Network (TIN) from the identified ground points. The height of the TIN facet at the centre of each cell is attributed to the DTM. TIN interpolation was used to ensure each point intercept sample had an associated ground height estimate. Next, the point cloud was normalised based on each point’s height above the TIN. This normalisation procedure provided a representation of the point cloud in relation to the ground.", 2. Materials and Method, Point Cloud Normalisation,2
1124,"To assess the performance of TLS and SfM in comparison to the reference measurements, the point clouds were assessed for their ability to represent the first intercept (highest vegetation intercept). This assessment of point cloud completeness was undertaken on non-normalised point clouds to mitigate the influence of errors introduced due to the ground height estimates. Subsequently, all intercepts measured during the validation process were compared to the respective point clouds. Vegetation height and cover were calculated from both the reference measurement and derived voxel spaces. Cover is defined as the proportion of the validation frame area that has vegetation above 10 cm. In the context of the validation frame, this is defined as the number of rods for which one or more intercept was recorded above 10 cm divided by 64. Difference in cover were summarised as a single difference value for each frame, while differences in first intercept height within each frame were summarised using RMSE calculated as follows:

This allowed for identification of vegetation elements (absolute) and the effect of determining a ground surface in altering the vegetation representation in the point cloud (normalised).", 2.

1125,"The TLS point clouds had a strong agreement between point clouds captured with and without the frame present. The low cover site had an MCC 0.89 and 0.87 and high cover site had agreement of MCC 0.82 and 0.84. Similar results were achieved with point clouds derived from SfM with little effect observed from the validation frame (low cover observing MCC 0.92 and 0.93, high cover observing MCC 0.73 and 0.77) (Figure 4). This indicates the validation frame had minimal impact on the utility of both TLS and SfM point clouds in representing vegetation.Figure 3 and Figure 4 show that any differences in the point clouds typically occurred within or on the edge of vegetation elements for both technologies. This suggests that the majority of the differences between the point clouds were due to other effects and not the presence of the frame. Differences in data capture geometry, windy conditions causing vegetation to move during data collection and small co-registration errors are likely causes of inaccurate vegetation reconstruction.", 3. Results, 3.1. Case Study 1,3
1126," 3.2.1. Correlation of Vegetation StructureComparison of SfM and TLS non-normalised point clouds to validation measurements demonstrate that both techniques capture representative vegetation structure. All sites displayed positive correlation with reference data (Table 2 and Table 3). Results suggest that SfM point clouds had a stronger correlation with the reference data than TLS point clouds (Table 2). Further, in environments with clearly defined vegetation (>0.02 m diameter), correlation between reference data and SfM and TLS point clouds was moderate (Royal Park: SfM, MCC 0.51, and TLS, MCC 0.37; and Ridgeway: SfM, MCC 0.66, and TLS, MCC 0.47). Reduced distance to the area of interest (less than 1.5 m) is predicted to be a major factor in the improved correlation seen in the SfM point clouds. In complex environments with fine vegetation (<0.02 m), there is lower correlation between reference measurements and point clouds from both SfM and TLS (Silvan1 and Silvan2: SfM, MCC 0.40 and 0.42, and TLS, MCC 0.25 and 0.16). This is due to the reduced likelihood of small structural elements being captured within the point cloud due to their physical size. Lower correlation of cover and biomass estimates has also been seen in other studies with fine-scale vegetation [1,22]. 3.2.2. Accuracy of Ground EstimationTLS and SfM point clouds from all sites show a greater amount of error in ground estimates as vegetation cover above 0.1 m increases (Figure 5). This pattern is evident in both SfM and TLS point clouds at High Camp (sparse cover with low height of vegetation) with a low RMSE (0.01–0.03 m). SfM and TLS point clouds with measured rod cover greater than 40 per cent have a higher RMSE for ground estimates (0.05–0.09 m). Consistently, high cover vegetation sites (such as Silvan1, Silvan2 and Royal Park) have deep leaf litter layers, which cause an underestimation of the height of the ground. Generally, TLS point clouds are more accurately able to estimate the ground surface. This is due to the greater penetration of the laser through to the surface of the ground [22]. SfM point clouds are also predicted to have lower correlation due to the ground filter settings applied to the SfM point clouds which over-estimated the height of the ground. Depth filtering algorithms applied during the point cloud construction process for SfM also reduces the potential for detailed ground re-construction in complex environments. These filter settings could be fine-tuned for each site, however this was deemed out of scope for this paper. 3.2.3. Normalised Correlation between Point Clouds and Reference MeasurementsNormalising SfM and TLS point clouds, with subsequent removal of the ground intercept from both the reference measurements and point clouds, resulted in lower correlation to reference measurements (Table 4 and Table 5). This was prevalent at all sites and most evident at sites with complex vertical arrangement of vegetation (Silvan1 and Silvan2). These results are attributed in both point clouds to the ground filter settings which had included vegetation that was on, or above the ground, in the ground estimate. This observation highlights one of the drawbacks to using remote sensing techniques in deep litter bed environments and supports the integration of direct measurements such as biomass harvesting with remote sensing technologies in the future. Similar to non-normalised point clouds, sites that had vegetation with small structural elements show poor correlation to reference measurements. For both TLS and SfM, low MCC correlations were observed for High Camp from the normalised point clouds. The derived ground surface was overestimated in height due to the rocky features at this site that were not excluded from the ground surface. Fine twigs of less than 0.05 m present at one of the sites in High Camp were also difficult to reconstruct, further reducing the correlation seen at this site. 3.2.4. Validation of First Intercept HeightModerate correlation were noted for both SfM and TLS point clouds to reference measurements of first intercept height at HighCamp, Royal Park, Silvan1 and Ridgeway (Figure 6 and Figure 7). SfM point clouds were not successful at resolving fine scale vegetation present at the top of the point cloud, for example Silvan1 and Silvan2 sites where a poor correlation to manually measured heights (

r

 0.32 and RMSE 0.18 m) was recorded. Small amounts of wind are likely to be a contribution to this poor correlation. Similar work completed by Wallace et al. [1] and Cooper et al. [22] also highlighted poor correlations of image based point clouds to destructive sampling of biomass in complex vertical structure and fine vegetation (e.g., woodland environments and grasslands). In this study, the sampling approach for SfM point clouds was not predicted to be a major contributor to error as the assessor captures images in close proximity (3 m) around the site of interest. TLS estimates of first intercept height had slightly stronger correlation to manually measured heights in complex environments. Occlusion from vegetation between the frame and the scanner locations as well as wind effects and movement in vegetation between scans may contribute to a lower correlation in TLS scans. The sampling approach used in this case study meant that scans could be approximately 5 m away from the sample site, which may contribute to a loss of detail. 3.2.5. Validation of Vegetation CoverThe estimates of cover from TLS and SfM point clouds are generally underestimated in comparison to the measurements of cover derived from the validation frame. Greater agreement is seen in environments where there is relatively sparse vegetation (High Camp and Ridgeway) (Figure 8). Investigation of SfM and TLS point clouds in complex vegetation environments (Royal Park and Silvan) highlighted little fine-scale vegetation being reconstructed and therefore underestimating cover. This should however be balanced against the fine scale nature of this vegetation and the capacity for this vegetation element to be over represented in the frame estimate of cover given the resolution of reference frame measurements is 10 mm and the vegetation element is less than 5 mm.Improved cover estimates are seen when the reference ground surface is utilised (instead of derived point cloud ground) in both SfM and TLS point clouds (Figure 9). SfM point clouds generated in complex vegetation sites (Silvan2) where the ground surface is calculated from reference measurements improves the accuracy of the cover estimates from a difference of −34.05% to 1.18% (reference cover measurement is 93%). This improvement is observed to be due to the correction of the ground surface with vegetation previously excluded from cover analysis now included. Similarly, in TLS point clouds, estimates of cover improve in complex vegetation types when using the reference measurements of the ground.", 3. Results, 3.2. Case Study 2,3

1132,"The validation frame developed in this research provides a portable, robust device to intensively assess the accuracy of point clouds for describing vegetation structure. The method provides a rigorous means for validating the information content within point clouds. Previously, validation approaches for point clouds have not been able to directly compare the representation provided by 3D remote sensing technology without utilising a indirect measure, such as biomass, mean height or 2D cover [1,19,22,28].The method presented here allows validation of the data through the full structure of the point cloud itself, not just the top height of vegetation. The measurements from the validation frame can be used at varying stages of the point-cloud processing workflow. The second case study presented here highlights that validation with the frame provides insight into the vegetation structure present while also allowing errors in other metrics to be quantified. For example, the effect of different ground filters can be assessed for the most accurate estimation. Previously, the effect of high frequency changes in the terrain has not been explored from these types of point clouds. The frame allows the terrain to be validated at 5 cm intervals and the effect of error in subsequent measurements or models (for example, vegetation height, litter bed depth or biomass) to be evaluated. This differentiates the approach from previous studies, which have only been able to hypothesise as to the causes of the unexplained variance when validating using biomass or visual estimates [22,26,27].The validation frame can provide insight into potential errors in ecological metric calculations. For example, missing information as seen in sites with complex vertical structure (Silvan1 and Silvan2) was demonstrated to be due to wind-driven errors in fine vegetation with small mass, and by occlusion from vegetation in the frame or surrounding vegetation. This information detected in the validation process then allows the determination of the importance of the missing information in relation to the desired metric calculation. This extra information may allow alternative processing strategies, such as the extraction of metrics that are not reliant on the ground to be used or corrections to be applied to the estimate of some metrics [57].The frame and method developed provides a non-destructive approach for validating point clouds. The results from Case Study 1 show that the environment being sampled has minimal change with the addition of the validation frame. This is in contrast to direct forms of assessment such as destructive sampling of biomass, which removes all vegetation and prohibits repeat sampling and change detection to occur. There is greater certainty in the alignment of the reference measurements with the point cloud can as the image capture and laser scans are conducted with the validation frame in-situ.Current visual assessments do not provide an accurate, objective quantification of vegetation structure [25,32,33]. The validation frame establishes a coordinate system allowing direct analysis of point clouds and the information content below the first intercept, including the vegetation structure and ground measurement. To achieve this, care must be taken when positioning the vertical rods to ensure minimal disturbance of the vegetation. This process was difficult in environments with fine scale vegetation (less than 0.01 m) which were susceptible to wind and also minor disturbances from the measurement rods. An alternative sampling approach using a vertically sliding frame and data collection to record presence and absence of vegetation within 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm voxels with biomass harvesting could be utilised to allow for some movement of vegetation through wind at the trade-off of precision [58]. Additionally, the time taken to complete a full assessment of the frame area including the harvesting and subsequent drying of biomass is expected to be more time consuming than the approach outlined in this research.In this study, we chose a frame size that is commensurate with recent studies utilising biomass harvesting as a source of information [48,49,50]. Nevertheless, the simple frame design allows the approach to be adaptable to different scales and resolutions (or density of horizontal measurements). For larger areas, distributing these frames throughout the captured area would allow the potential uncertainty in understory vegetation measurements from point clouds to be better understood in that environment. In such examples, the number of frames and their placement would be dependent on the vegetation community being sampled, the point cloud sensor sampling approach and the area being captured. This allows the approach to be applied beyond the environments presented in this paper and adapted depending upon the purpose of validation and metric generation.", 4. Discussion,None,4
1133,"New methods for creating 3D representations using localised remote sensing are improving our ability to reproduce and evaluate vegetation structure. These methods, primarily using SfM and TLS, generate point clouds which are information rich and enable comprehensive quantitative descriptions of vegetation. These methods are becoming common practice and in some instances replacing traditional visual assessments and other indirect forms of characterising the natural environment. However, the accuracy and completeness of the reproductions of vegetation structure using these methods is untested. This paper describes an innovative solution that addresses the challenge of validating the information content of terrestrial point clouds of vegetation. The proposed method is non-destructive and provides a reference system accurately linking the validation information and point cloud data. Through two case studies, it was shown that a number of sources of unexplained variance in both TLS and SfM point cloud vegetation models can be described using the developed approach.", 5.

 fertilization, nitrogen deposition, and the spread of pests and invasive species. While methods such as in situ inventories, atmospheric trace-gas measurement, and numerical modeling can provide valuable insights into quantifying and attributing impacts [1,2,3,4,5], remote sensing of the land surface offers a unique avenue for observing changes in vegetation cover over large areas and timespans of days to decades. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), based on the relative surface reflectance in red and near-infrared wavelengths, is well correlated with cover of healthy vegetation [6], and regional and global products based on different satellite sensors are available [7,8]. The NDVI is negatively affected by drought in warm regions [9,10,11] but has increased in response to warming in many temperate and Arctic areas, which has resulted in longer growing seasons there [12,13,14]. For East and Central Asia, the NDVI was found to have increased from approximately 1982 to 1996 as a result of longer growing seasons, and it then decreased from 1997 to 2006 as a result of worsening aridity [15,16]. Urbanization, irrigation and fertilization can also change the NDVI [17,18]. Because the trends in most places are small in magnitude, remote sensing data needs to be carefully processed to remove artifacts due to, for example, degradation of the satellite sensors over the course of a mission [19].Here, we study trends in the vegetation cover in Nepal (located at 26°N–31°N, 80°E–89°E) a least developed country for which the majority of the population is engaged in agriculture and that is highly vulnerable to climate change. Nepal is a biodiversity hotspot, as a result, in part, of the wide topographic and climatic range found over relatively short distances, ranging from the Indo-Gangetic Plain in the south to the Himalayan peaks and the Tibetan Plateau to the north [20]. Several studies of NDVI trends in the broader region have previously been conducted. A generally increasing trend in the spring NDVI over the Hindu Kush–Himalayan region was found between 1982 and 2006 in [21]. The NDVI seasonality was analyzed in [22] between 1982 and 2006 for the Himalayan region, including Nepal, and it was found that the start date of the growing season trended earlier, while the end date did not change. Cluster analysis was conducted in [23] to identify patterns in the mean and maximum warm-season NDVI between 2001 and 2016; mostly increasing trends (greening) were found, and decreasing trends (browning) were most common between 4 and 5 km elevation. Similarly, a study of NDVI trends in Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon Nature Reserve, Tibet between 1999 and 2013 [24] found that greening was concentrated at the lower elevations, below 3 km. Delayed green-up in alpine grasslands of the western Tibetan Plateau may be due to declines in spring precipitation [25,26].Limited research has been carried out on NDVI trends specifically in Nepal. Forest types in the Manaslu Conservation Area were mapped and NDVI trends and correlations with temperature and precipitation from a nearby meteorological station were computed for 2000–2008 in [27]. A significant increasing trend in the warm-season NDVI over the Koshi River Basin for 1982–2006 was found in [28], although with a decline between 1994 and 2000.This research, therefore, has two main objectives. First, we describe trends in the NDVI in Nepal by elevation and season on the basis of a long-term remote sensing data product. Second, we attempt to attribute trends and interannual variability to changes in the climate, land use, and CO

1135," 2.1.1. NDVINDVI data was obtained from the NDVI3g.v1 time series, an update of the earlier NDVI3g.v0 [29], which provides NDVI values twice a month on a 1/12 degree (approximately 8 km) grid from July 1981 to December 2015. This dataset is derived from measurements by over a dozen advanced very high resolution radiometers (AVHRRs) that orbited on different satellites for parts of this time period. It has been extensively processed to correct for artifacts resulting from causes such as instrument and orbit drift and volcanic eruptions, so as to be suitable for analysis of climate change. The formula for the NDVI is (NIR − RED)/(NIR + RED), where NIR refers to reflectance in the AVHRR near-infrared band (channel 2; 0.725–1.10

Missing or suspect data in NDVI3g.v1 was flagged and filled in either by spline interpolation or from an average of other years.Despite quality control steps used to derive this product, we found occasional NDVI values that were quite different from those at adjacent time periods, and which were therefore likely to be due to satellite instrument or viewing condition artifacts [31]. We therefore smoothed the NDVI3g.v1 series by subtracting the median seasonal cycle, applying a three-point median filter, and adding the seasonal cycle back. 2.1.2. ElevationElevation was obtained at 3 arcsecond (approximately 80 m) resolution from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and World Wildlife Foundation (WWF) hydrological data and maps based on the Shuttle Elevation Derivatives at multiple Scales (HydroSHEDS) project. HydroSHEDS is derived from spaceborne radar images with extensive quality control and corrections of artifacts [32]. We computed the average and standard deviation of the elevation over each 1/12° grid cell in Nepal as possible predictors of the NDVI. The mean pixel elevations ranged from 60 to over 6000 m (Figure 1a), with an average of 2078 m. 2.1.3. ClimateThe monthly mean temperature and precipitation were obtained on a 1° grid. The precipitation was from the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) combined Full Version 7 and Monitoring Version 4 product, which is based on quality-controlled data from thousands of stations globally (including data contributed by Nepal through the World Meteorological Organization) that is interpolated to fill in gaps in coverage [33,34,35]. The temperature was from the Berkeley Earth (BEST) dataset, which uses several times the number of station records compared to other gridded temperature datasets. Station records undergo automated quality control and are weighted using geostatistics methods to produce spatial fields [36].The 1° resolution of these available products does not fully resolve the topography-driven climate variability in Nepal. We mitigated this shortcoming, to some extent, by applying downscaling adjustments. We downscaled the temperature data within each 1° cell to 1/12° by applying a lapse rate of 6 K/km as an additive adjustment. This lapse rate was approximately that inferred from the temperature difference between adjacent BEST pixels, which was found to be approximately the same for all seasons. We downscaled the precipitation data within each 1° cell to 1/12° by applying a multiplicative conversion factor based on the higher-resolution gridded APHRODITE product, available for 1951–2007 in a public version at 0.25° resolution and, courtesy of the Nepal Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, at the original 0.05° interpolation resolution [37]. These adjustment factors were the same for each month, so that time trends were not affected and the 1° mean values from BEST and GPCC were preserved.The mean temperature and precipitation obtained, along with the mean elevation, for each 1/12° NDVI pixel are shown in Figure 1. 2.1.4. Land CoverLand cover classifications for 1990, 2000, and 2010 were obtained from the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) [38]. These were generated using public domain Landsat Thematic Mapper 30 m images and an object-based classification algorithm, and they were validated and refined using aerial photographs and field observations. The land cover classes were forest, shrub, grass, agricultural, barren, lake, river, snow/glacier, and urban. We computed the percentage in each cover category for each 1/12° pixel and year. Land cover was imputed by pixel and year via linear interpolation between the three available years. Before 1990 and after 2010, we assumed the land cover to have remained constant at the earliest/latest available value.The obtained land cover classification showed that forest (at almost half the area) and agriculture (at about a quarter) were the dominant categories (Table 1). Agriculture dominated in the lowest elevations in the south, while forest dominated in the middle elevations, and grassland, snow and glaciers were found at high elevations in the north (Figure 2). Forest cover decreased by several percentage points between 1990 and 2000, while agricultural and barren areas increased, before stabilizing between 2000 and 2010 (Table 1). 2.1.5. CO

HydroSHEDS is derived from spaceborne radar images with extensive quality control and corrections of artifacts [32]. We computed the average and standard deviation of the elevation over each 1/12° grid cell in Nepal as possible predictors of the NDVI. The mean pixel elevations ranged from 60 to over 6000 m (Figure 1a), with an average of 2078 m.", 2. Methods, 2.1.2. Elevation,2
1138,"The monthly mean temperature and precipitation were obtained on a 1° grid. The precipitation was from the Global Precipitation Climatology Center (GPCC) combined Full Version 7 and Monitoring Version 4 product, which is based on quality-controlled data from thousands of stations globally (including data contributed by Nepal through the World Meteorological Organization) that is interpolated to fill in gaps in coverage [33,34,35]. The temperature was from the Berkeley Earth (BEST) dataset, which uses several times the number of station records compared to other gridded temperature datasets. Station records undergo automated quality control and are weighted using geostatistics methods to produce spatial fields [36].The 1° resolution of these available products does not fully resolve the topography-driven climate variability in Nepal. We mitigated this shortcoming, to some extent, by applying downscaling adjustments. We downscaled the temperature data within each 1° cell to 1/12° by applying a lapse rate of 6 K/km as an additive adjustment. This lapse rate was approximately that inferred from the temperature difference between adjacent BEST pixels, which was found to be approximately the same for all seasons. We downscaled the precipitation data within each 1° cell to 1/12° by applying a multiplicative conversion factor based on the higher-resolution gridded APHRODITE product, available for 1951–2007 in a public version at 0.25° resolution and, courtesy of the Nepal Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, at the original 0.05° interpolation resolution [37]. These adjustment factors were the same for each month, so that time trends were not affected and the 1° mean values from BEST and GPCC were preserved.The mean temperature and precipitation obtained, along with the mean elevation, for each 1/12° NDVI pixel are shown in Figure 1.", 2.

These were generated using public domain Landsat Thematic Mapper 30 m images and an object-based classification algorithm, and they were validated and refined using aerial photographs and field observations. The land cover classes were forest, shrub, grass, agricultural, barren, lake, river, snow/glacier, and urban. We computed the percentage in each cover category for each 1/12° pixel and year. Land cover was imputed by pixel and year via linear interpolation between the three available years. Before 1990 and after 2010, we assumed the land cover to have remained constant at the earliest/latest available value.The obtained land cover classification showed that forest (at almost half the area) and agriculture (at about a quarter) were the dominant categories (Table 1). Agriculture dominated in the lowest elevations in the south, while forest dominated in the middle elevations, and grassland, snow and glaciers were found at high elevations in the north (Figure 2). Forest cover decreased by several percentage points between 1990 and 2000, while agricultural and barren areas increased, before stabilizing between 2000 and 2010 (Table 1).", 2. Methods, 2.1.4.

1141,"We expect the relationship of the NDVI with such variables as temperature, precipitation and elevation to be nonlinear. There also may well be interactions between potential explanatory variables, for example, the effect of precipitation increase could vary depending on elevation and season. A random forest (RF) of regression trees [43] is a method of empirically constructing a predictive model that is well suited for handling such complexity. As such, RFs have been used in many environmental mapping applications, including for wetland cover from radar imagery [44], water table dynamics and depth to groundwater [45,46], and ecosystem light-use efficiency [47]. Here, the training data were half of the available 1,429,443 NDVI values from Nepal (1955 pixels for 828 time periods, excluding 12% interpolated data). The half the available data not used to train the model (test data) provided a test of its ability to capture the NDVI patterns consistently found by remote sensing. The RF model run included 100 regression trees, and other parameter settings were kept at default values from the R randomForest package [48].The predictors in the RF model fell into the following categories: (1) Interannually constant seasonal and geographic factors: month of year, pixel longitude, pixel latitude, pixel mean elevation, and pixel standard deviation of elevation. (2) Mean temperature (°C) for 0–0.5, 0.5–1.5, 1.5–3, 3–6, 6–12, 12–24, and 24–48 months prior to the end of each semimonthly period.

We then used the fitted model to predict the NDVI trends if only one factor (temperature, precipitation, land use, or CO

) changes with time, while the others are held at average values for the period (in the case of temperature and precipitation, seasonally specific averages). To the extent that these factors have different time histories so that their effects on the NDVI can be separated by the RF model, this would allow us to estimate how much of the NDVI trends and interannual variability over Nepal could be attributed to each factor.", 2. Methods, 2.2. Regression Model,2
1142,"For each grid cell and (semimonthly) time of year, we computed the NDVI trend as the slope obtained from linear regression, using only non-interpolated values. The trends were similarly computed for the RF-predicted NDVI.

The mean seasonal cycle was subtracted to obtain a deseasonalized time series for computing trends and detrended variability. We also computed the mean NDVI values and trends by season and elevation, using a smoothing spline [50] to estimate the mean elevation dependence.", 2. Methods, 2.3. Analysis,2
1143,"The mean NDVI was near zero in the dry, cold, high-elevation north of Nepal, which has little vegetation. It was somewhat lower in the low plains near the Indian border, compared to middle elevations, peaking at about 0.65 over the elevation range of 500–2000 m (Figure 4).The time series of the mean NDVI is dominated by the seasonal cycle, although interannual variability is also evident (Figure 5). The mean NDVI seasonal cycle nationally and at elevations under ∼4000 m was influenced more by moisture than by temperature, with peak values immediately after the monsoon in early October. The NDVI declined through winter, as water availability decreased, and reached a nadir in late April (Figure 5b; Figure 6a). At higher elevations (4000–5000 m), the peak occurs earlier (late September) and the lowest values are in late February, consistent with a greater role of cold temperature in controlling vegetation cover.The NDVI overall showed an increasing linear trend, averaging

It was strongest in late August through October, near the annual peak, and in the lower elevations, below 2000 m (Figure 6b). The NDVI at 4000–5000 m actually showed a slight declining trend.The RF model was able to represent most of the observed variability in NDVI (Figure 7a), with an

 change is the dominant factor for most of the affected seasons and elevations. Land-use change seems to have had the largest impacts, which varied by season, above 2000 m. Precipitation trends impacted the NDVI primarily during the monsoon season of summer and early fall. Temperature trends increased the NDVI in the spring and fall at around 3000–4500 m.", 3. Results,None,3
1144,"We found an overall increasing trend in the NDVI for Nepal over 1981–2015. The RF analysis suggests that this trend is not primarily due to changes in climate (temperature and precipitation), but correlates best with an increasing atmospheric CO

 fertilization, and climate and land-use changes play secondary roles [5]. An increasing trend in global net primary productivity, particularly in tropical forests, has also been identified on the basis of satellite imagery for 1982–1999 and is attributed primarily to CO



2


 fertilization [2]. On the other hand, in boreal areas, warming has been a major driver of longer growing seasons and higher productivity [51,52], while in arid and semiarid areas, moisture availability is a primary modulator of vegetation growth [15,53,54,55]. The small positive impact of precipitation on NDVI trends, concentrated during and after the summer monsoon, is consistent with the increasing trend in monsoon precipitation found for recent decades over much of Nepal [56], although dry spells have also increased [57,58].Land-cover change is inferred to have made a negative contribution to the NDVI trend. This is plausible insofar as the land cover data show a net decrease in the forest area and an increase in the agricultural area, where forest often has a higher and more constant NDVI than agricultural land [59]. Although the importance of anthropogenic land-cover change as a driver of ecological impacts is widely recognized [60,61,62], studies of global and regional NDVI trends over recent decades have generally concentrated on climate drivers without explicitly accounting for the contribution of land-cover change. A RF model offers one method to distinguish the influence of all these factors, which operate simultaneously around the world.The work presented here has several significant limitations. The NDVI trends attributed to CO



2


 level in the RF model could well also reflect contributions from other factors that have been changing quasi-linearly and whose quantitative evolution was not incorporated in the RF model. These may include, for example, nitrogen fertilization as a result of direct application and deposition, irrigation, change in crops planted, management of grasslands and forests, and changes in cloud and aerosols. For most of these terms, more work is needed to understand how they are changing over different parts of Nepal. Additionally, the quality of some of the inputs used could be improved. Land-cover change could be evaluated from Landsat imagery before 1990 and after 2010. A precipitation product at higher resolution, which could be based on remote sensing calibrated to available weather stations, would better resolve the sharp elevation and orographic gradients within Nepal and thus help to clarify the impact of moisture stress [63,64,65].", 4. Discussion,None,4
1145,"We found that the NDVI increased over the studied period in Nepal, which is consistent with global trends. The increases were uneven and concentrated at low and middle elevations during the fall (post-monsoon). We inferred from the fitted RF model that the NDVI linear trend was primarily due to CO



2


 level (or another environmental parameter that changes quasi-linearly), and not primarily due to temperature or precipitation trends. On the other hand, the interannual fluctuation in the NDVI was correlated more with temperature and particularly with precipitation. The RF accurately fit the available data and shows promise for estimating trends in incompletely sampled spatiotemporal remote sensing data, such as the gridded NDVI, and for testing hypotheses about their causes.

1146,"Wildfire related risk and damage have increased over the past three decades [1], causing threats to ecosystem function and human society. Currently, global warming and extreme droughts are contributing to increased wildfire activities [2]. Increased wildfires in return cause more warming effects through quick release of carbon sequestered in terrestrial ecosystems [3]. Wildfires play important roles in ecosystem succession, biogeochemical cycles and climate change. Thus, accurately mapping burned areas, serving as the basic step for wildfire management, is crucial for the analysis of carbon emissions and fire risk as well as understanding the effects of climate change on ecosystems.Remotely sensed images have been used for mapping burned areas for decades [4,5]. Fire-induced changes such as vegetation removal, structure alteration and charcoal deposition all cause spectral shift that enable multispectral remote sensing techniques to be applied. To be specific, notable responses are observed in Near infrared (NIR) (decrease) and shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands (increase) [6]. Classification techniques like logistic regression [7] and object-based classification [8] have been proven to be effective in capturing spectral features of burned regions. Spectral indices like Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index [9] and differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) index [10] are also commonly used to create burned maps. With improved availability of multitemporal remote sensing imagery, burned areas have also been mapped using time series analysis. Hawbaker et al. [11] produced long term burn area products in the conterminous United States with Landsat images. Roteta et al. [12] also used time series of Sentinel−2 A images to map burned areas in sub-Saharan Africa and the accuracy was claimed to be higher than that of the MODIS global fire product (MCD64 A1). However, remote sensing images are limited in capturing the three-dimensional (3D) vegetation structure, which makes it difficult to obtain under canopy fire information and canopy height measurement [13]. To provide more accurate estimation of fire severity, terrestrial carbon storage and biomass emissions, methods based on 3D data are essential to complement existing image-based approaches [14,15].Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) offers an effective way of producing 3D structures, which has previously been applied for mapping burned areas and forest fuel types [16,17]. By measuring the time interval of transmitted and received energy, LiDAR can calculate the distance between LiDAR sensor and targets, providing information on the three-dimensional structure of vegetated ecosystems [18]. Thus, LiDAR can be used to monitor structure changes of vegetation caused by fires. Wang et al. [19] mapped burned areas based on height differences of sagebrush derived from pre- and post-fire airborne LiDAR data and classified the whole region into three levels of severity using height thresholds. Montealegre et al. [17] applied a logistic regression model to classify burned areas in Spanish forests based on post-fire airborne LiDAR data. Other studies, e.g., Garcia et al. [16] integrated post-fire airborne LiDAR data and Landsat images to map burned areas and estimate consumed biomass with high accuracy. While using airborne LiDAR data provides detailed vegetation structure with high accuracy, the application of these data over large areas is constrained by the high expense associated with data acquisition.At regional and global scales, spaceborne LiDAR has been instrumental in capturing 3D data globally and efficiently with fixed footprint and revisit time, providing large coverage and repeatable observations [20,21]. A notable spaceborne LiDAR mission includes National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) first Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) mission, which carried the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), which is a waveform LiDAR instrument, launched in January 2003. GLAS is the first spaceborne LiDAR sensor with the aim of measuring ice sheets globally [22]. The footprint of GLAS beams is 70 m and the along-track sampling distance is 172 m with a wavelength of 1064 nm [20]. GLAS records backward energy with waveform LiDAR measurement for each footprint. This mission stopped collecting data in October 2009, after providing billions of LiDAR waveform data for the analysis of ice, cloud and vegetation [16,23]. These waveform data were also employed to evaluate fire disturbance in Alaska forests [24], where structure changes of forests between burned and unburned areas were found to be significant. Moreover, García et al. [25] used GLAS data to characterize canopy fuels. However, the ICESat footprint, though unprecedented at the time, is quite coarse (70 m) which limited the resolution of finer 3D details.As a follow-up mission to ICESat, ICESat−2 was launched on September 15 2018 with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) [21,26]. ATLAS is a photon counting LiDAR with a footprint of 14 m and along-track sampling distance of 0.7 m, which presents a tremendous improvement in sampling compared to its predecessor. The ATLAS instrument measures the time a photon takes to travel from ATLAS to Earth and back so as to determine the photon’s geodetic latitude and longitude. Unlike single waveform beams in GLAS, ATLAS emits three pairs of beams with a wavelength of 532 nm. Each pair consists of a strong beam and weak beam using a transmit energy ratio of 4:1. The improved spatial resolution and coverage of ICESat−2 will better assist the mapping of ice and vegetation. One of ICESat−2’s data products is the Land and Vegetation height product (ATL08), which provides terrain and canopy height measurement at 100 m segments along the ground track. The ATL08 product provides various canopy and terrain related metrics such as mean canopy height, max canopy height, apparent surface reflectance, the number of canopy photons, the number of terrain photon and canopy openness in each segment. ATL08 also provides cloud masks to help clean and filter the data. This standard canopy product will facilitate forests assessment at global scales and promote carbon monitoring. In this study, ATL08 data are used to map burned areas, which, based on current literature, is the first attempt of using such data for this purpose.Machine learning has shown great success in classification and discrimination of remote sensing data [27,28]. With the capability to model complex class signatures without statistical assumptions on data distribution (non-parametric) and the ability to process high-dimensional data, machine learning approaches are widely accepted [29]. Moreover, machine learning algorithms are more robust and produce higher classification accuracy than traditional parametric classifiers such as maximum likelihood [27,29]. Machine learning methods such as random forest [30], gradient boosted regression [11] and neural network have found application in various studies. Wu et al. [31] evaluated support vector machine, Random Forest and decision tree to classify point clouds to obtain canola canopy structures, concluding that Random Forest provides better results. Krishna Moorthy et al. [32] classified liana stems from point clouds by Random Forest with an accuracy of 88%. For this study, we used Random Forest to classify burned 100 m ATL08 photon segments and logistic regression is also included for comparison.In this study, we investigated the application of ICESat−2 photon counting data for burned area mapping, which is the first attempt to employ spaceborne LiDAR in fire classification. Innovative aspects of this research include the use of machine learning methods with photon counting data to provide three-dimensional structural information along the satellite tracks. Optical images derived burn maps were used as references. Moreover, land cover maps were used to avoid interference of different land covers. The main goal was to investigate the feasibility of using ATL08 to map burned areas of wildfires. Our specific objectives were: (1) to develop a methodology for using ATL08 data for burned areas classification; (2) to compare the effects of Sentinel−2 and Landsat 8 images when used as reference images for identifying burned areas; (3) to compare the accuracy of different classification methods for ATL08 100 m-segments, like Random Forest and logistic regression; (4) to identify the most significant variables in ATL08 for classification of burned areas.", 1.

1147,"Two study areas were chosen for burned area classification (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The first site is located in northern California.

The Delta Fire started on September 5, 2018 and stopped on October 7, 2018 in Shasta-Trinity National forest. The whole region is dominated by forests including ponderosa pine, canyon live oak and Douglas-fir with scattered shrubs, grasslands and bare grounds.The second site is in Catron County, western New Mexico (Figure 1). Burn events on this site are mainly attributed to the Buzzard Fire, which burned parts of the Gila National Forest (Figure 2f). The Buzzard Fire occurred from May 22, 2018 until it was completely contained on June 24, 2018, after burning more than 20,000 hectares.

ATL08ATL08 land and canopy height product is produced from ICESat−2 global geolocated photon data (ATL03), which include location (x, y, z) of each bounce point where photon interacts with land surface. In the following context, we use ‘location of photon’ to paraphrase ‘location of point where photon interacts with land surface’. Using the Differential, Regressive and Gaussian Adaptive Nearest Neighbor (DARGANN) algorithm, solar background noises in ATL03 are removed and signal photons are selected [33]. Then, the signal photons are filtered and classified into ground, canopy and top of canopy photons. Based on those classified photons, land and canopy structure related metrics are calculated and stored in ATL08 in h5 format. ATL08 data acquired on December 28, 2018 were downloaded for the northern California site from the National Snow & Ice Data Center (NSIDC) [34].

There were many metrics recorded for each 100 m segment and we used only the ones related to canopy three-dimensional structure (Table 1).In h5 format, data were stored in several groups. ATL08 contains 10 major groups: metadata, ancillary_data, gt1 l, gt1 r, gt2 l, gt2 r, gt3 l, gt3 r, orbit_info and quality_assessment, where gt1 l means the left beam of ground track one, gt1 r means the right beam of ground track one and so forth. Six gtx groups contained height metrics of 100 m segments for ground tracks and the other four metadata related groups provided information on instrument, orbit and data quality [34]. The gtx group had two sub-groups: land_segments and signal_photons, where land_segments provided metrics and signal_photons provided information on corresponding ATL03 photons. Twenty-one metrics were obtained directly from ATL08 and three derived metrics were also employed (Table 1). For our analysis, only the three strong beams were employed, as they provided more vegetation photons. In ATL08 data, cloud obstructed segments and empty segments were filled by 3.4028 × 1038, which were discarded in this study. 2.2.2.

For the northern California site, the two images, one on July 12, 2018 and the other on October 15, 2018 (Figure 1), were atmospherically corrected by Sen2 Cor tool downloaded from the European Space Agency [36]. There are 13 bands in Sentinel−2 data with three different spatial resolutions: 10 m, 20 m and 60 m. Bands with 10 m resolution (B2, B3, B4 and B8) were selected (Table 2). The 20 m shortwave near infrared bands B11 and B12 (Table 2) were resized to 10 m using the nearest neighbor method. Then, these six bands were stacked and used in further processing. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for July 10, 2018 (pre-fire) and October 14, 2018 (post-fire) were also downloaded from USGS. ARD contains surface reflectance of Landsat images from Landsat 4 to Landsat 8 and served for direct use in monitoring and assessing land cover changes. Similarly, the seven Landsat bands (B1 to B7) (Table 2) were stacked in the order of wavelength and used for later classification.For the western New Mexico site, Sentinel−2 images on May 17, 2018 (pre-fire) and June 21, 2018 (post-fire) were downloaded. The fire was completely stopped on June 24, 2018 but there are no subsequent cloud free images after June 24 due to clouds. Therefore, the image on June 21 was used, which is acceptable, as most fires were contained before that day. Meanwhile, Landsat 8 ARD on May 17, 2018 (pre-fire) and June 27, 2018 (post-fire) were downloaded from USGS for comparison.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Data,2

There are 13 bands in Sentinel−2 data with three different spatial resolutions: 10 m, 20 m and 60 m. Bands with 10 m resolution (B2, B3, B4 and B8) were selected (Table 2). The 20 m shortwave near infrared bands B11 and B12 (Table 2) were resized to 10 m using the nearest neighbor method. Then, these six bands were stacked and used in further processing. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) Analysis Ready Data (ARD) for July 10, 2018 (pre-fire) and October 14, 2018 (post-fire) were also downloaded from USGS. ARD contains surface reflectance of Landsat images from Landsat 4 to Landsat 8 and served for direct use in monitoring and assessing land cover changes. Similarly, the seven Landsat bands (B1 to B7) (Table 2) were stacked in the order of wavelength and used for later classification.For the western New Mexico site, Sentinel−2 images on May 17, 2018 (pre-fire) and June 21, 2018 (post-fire) were downloaded. The fire was completely stopped on June 24, 2018 but there are no subsequent cloud free images after June 24 due to clouds. Therefore, the image on June 21 was used, which is acceptable, as most fires were contained before that day. Meanwhile, Landsat 8 ARD on May 17, 2018 (pre-fire) and June 27, 2018 (post-fire) were downloaded from USGS for comparison.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2.2. Sentinel and Landsat Data,2
1151,"To avoid the interference of different land covers, an accurate forest map is necessary. In the northern California site, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values were calculated based on the pre-fire Sentinel−2 images. A threshold of 0.3, selected based on Otsu method [37], was used for northern California forests to mask non-vegetation pixels. Next, vegetation pixels were classified into 20 classes by the Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Technique (IsoData) (Figure 3) in ENVI 5.5 (Harris Geospatial Solutions). Then, the 20 classes were merged into forest or non-forest types (Figure 4) based on Google Maps and visual interpretation. Finally, 200 random samples were created to assess classification accuracy based on visualization of each sample using Google Earth and pre-fire Sentinel−2 images, including 100 samples for the forest and another 100 samples for the non-forest areas. The overall accuracy turned out to be 88% and kappa was 0.76. The Landsat 8 OLI pre-fire image was also used to produce forest map of northern California with the same routine. The 200 random samples were employed to assess the accuracy of the OLI classification map. The overall accuracy of OLI forest map was 86% and kappa was 0.71, which are slightly lower than that of Sentinel−2. Table S1 in Supplemental materials shows that forest regions in Landsat 8 classification map are overestimated (row sum 126 larger than column sum 108), which is illustrated in Figure 4c.In the New Mexico site, the Sentinel−2 image pre-fire was classified into 20 classes by IsoData and then merged into forest and non-forest based on visualization of Google map, pre- and post-fire images. Then, 200 random samples were used to check the classification accuracy. The same routine was employed on Landsat 8 data. Overall accuracy of Sentinel−2 forest map is 86.5% and kappa is 0.73. For Landsat 8 forest map, overall accuracy and kappa are 85% and 0.7035, respectively. Forest regions are overestimated in Landsat 8 map (Figure 4g) relative to Sentinel−2 map (Figure 4e). Confusion matrices are shown in Table S1 in Supplemental materials.Then, both pre- and post-fire Sentinel−2 images were employed to produce reference burned areas map. First, Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) (Equation (1)) indices were calculated based on pre-fire images and post-fire images separately. Next, the differenced NBR (dNBR) between pre-fire and post-fire data were derived. Fire perimeters downloaded from the Cal Fire (https://frap.fire.ca.gov/mapping/gis-data/) were used to mask out unburned pixels. Based on the suggested value from United States Geological Survey (USGS) [14,38], as shown in Table 3, a threshold of dNBR = 0.1 was further used to classify pixels into burned (>0.1) and unburned (<0.1) (Figure 4), removing those unburned islands within the fire perimeters. Landsat 8 images were also used to derive burned map in the same way. In total, 200 randomly created samples, 100 for burned regions and 100 for unburned regions, were employed to check the accuracy of burn map. Based on visual interpretation of each sample using Google Maps and post-fire images, overall accuracy of Sentinel−2 burn map is 85.5% and kappa is 0.71. For the Landsat 8 burn map, overall accuracy and kappa are 88.5% and 0.7676, respectively. Confusion matrices of burn maps are shown in Table S2 in the Supplemental materials.In the western New Mexico site, a fire perimeter was downloaded from USGS (https://www.geomac.gov/GeoMACKML/getKML.aspx) to mask unburned pixels, and then, dNBR = 0.1 was used to remove unburned islands within fire perimeters with Sentinel−2 data and Landsat 8 data, respectively. In total, 200 randomly created samples, 100 for burned regions and 100 for unburned regions, were used to check accuracy of burn map. Based on visual interpretation of each sample using Google map and post-fire image, overall accuracy of Sentinel−2 burn map is 87.5% and kappa is 0.75. For the Landsat 8 burn map, overall accuracy and kappa are 87.5% and 0.7465, respectively. Confusion matrices of burn maps are shown in Table S2 in Supplemental materials.

where NIR means near infrared bands (B8 in Sentinel−2 or B5 in Landsat 8), SWIR2 (B12 in Sentinel−2 or B7 in Landsat 8) means shortwave infrared bands. Dates of pre-fire and post-fire images are described in Section 2.2.2.For the northern California forest region, ATL08 segments locating between 40.480 N and 41.049 N were selected to cover both burned and unburned forests, as higher latitudes were snow covered. When overlaying forest map derived from optical images with ATL08 segments, a segment was regarded as forest segment if over 90% of pixels within it (a pixel will be counted even though only part of it is within the segment) were forest type. The segment was defined as non-forest type when over 90% of pixels were non-forest. The same rule was applied to the burned map. In the western New Mexico site, ATL08 segments within 33.55 N and 33.85 N were selected, as forests are dominant within the region. Due to the existence of outliers, a range of µ ± 2σ was employed to remove extreme values for each metric, where µ is the average and σ is the standard deviation. There are 592 forest segments (417 in northern California and 175 in western New Mexico) in total based on the Sentinel−2 forest map and burn map and 744 forest segments (551 in northern California and 193 in western New Mexico) using Landsat 8 data, combining the two study areas.", 2.

1152," 2.4.1. Fitting Random Forest ModelThe 24 canopy related LiDAR metrics were used as independent variables in building models for classifying burned areas. The dependent variable was the burn condition and was modeled as a binary variable (burned = 1, unburned = 0). Total ATL08 forest segments from both sites were randomly divided into two groups, 70% for training and the rest, 30%, for testing. In total, 1000 trees were used in the training process in R package ‘randomForest’. The best number of splits, which means the best number of predictors in a subset, was determined by the minimum out of bag (OOB) error. In Sentinel−2 derived samples, 414 ATL08 segments were used for training and 178 segments for testing. For Landsat 8 derived samples, 521 segments were used for training and 223 segments for testing.Random Forest model was also used to estimate burn severity (which is approximated by dNBR). At first, for each ATL08 segment, average dNBR of covered pixels was calculated. In total, 24 metrics were used as features and the average dNBR value was a response variable. Using 70% samples for training and 30% for testing, the accuracy of burn severity estimation by the trained model can be evaluated. Relative differenced NBR index (RdNBR) (=dNBR/sqrt(NBRpre-fire)) [39] was also employed in burn severity estimation to compare with dNBR. 2.4.2. Fitting Logistic Regression ModelLogistic regression, serving as a classical statistic model, is suitable for categorical variables such as burned and unburned. Rather than modeling a categorical variable Y directly, logistic regression models the probability that y belongs to a specific class. For example, for a dichotomous problem burned (y = 1) and unburned (y = 0), logistic function fits a S-shaped curve with variables x1, x2, ···, xn (Equation (2)). A default threshold of probability is 0.5. Therefore, when the fitted probability is higher than 0.5, we get y = 1, otherwise, y = 0. The ‘stats’ package in R was used to conduct a multi-variate logistic regression. Training samples were employed to estimate the coefficient of each predictor. A stepwise procedure based on mixed selection was utilized to remove those insignificant metrics. Then, testing samples were used for accuracy assessment.

1155,"Figure 5 shows correlations of 24 LiDAR metrics of all Sentinel−2 derived samples in the northern California site and western New Mexico site. Basically, most metrics are significantly correlated with others, but the correlation coefficients vary greatly, which means metrics such as asr (apparent surface reflectance) and n_ca_photons (the number of canopy photons) still cannot replace each other. Moreover, most metrics are positively correlated with other metrics except asr, n_te_photons (the number of terrain photons), CV (coefficient of variation) and sd_ratio (standard deviation ratio). Canopy height related metrics such as RH25, RH50, RH60, RH70, RH75, RH80, RH85, RH90, RH95 and RH98 were highly correlated. However, metrics including dif_canopy (canopy difference to median height), min (minimum canopy height), n_ca_photons, n_toc_photons (the number of top of canopy photons), toc_roughness (top of canopy roughness), asr and n_te_photons have less correlation with other metrics, indicating splitting photon points into different types such as canopy photons, terrain photons and top of canopy photons provides extra information.Figure 6 provides barplots of 24 metrics derived with Sentinel−2 forest maps and landcover maps from both study sites. Burned segments tend to have lower values than unburned segments except dif_canopy (canopy difference to median height), min (minimum canopy height) and CV (coefficient of variation). For example, average of n_ca_photons (the number of canopy photons) is 105 for burned segments which is lower than 128 of unburned segments. Moreover, the differences of average between burned segments and unburned segments are significant in most metrics except canopy_openness (canopy openness), dif_canopy, min and sd_ratio (standard deviation ratio). The average of CV is significantly increased after fire, which is due to different magnitude of change in mean and standard deviation of canopy height.Based on training data (70% of ATL08 segments) derived with Sentinel−2 forest maps and burn maps, the best number of splits was set as 10 in each bootstrap iteration, corresponding to the minimum OOB error of 18.84%. For the testing samples (30% of ATL08 segments), the overall accuracy is 83.15% and kappa is 0.6435. The high classification accuracy is due to the difference of burned and unburned metrics recorded by ATL08. As shown in Figure 6, most metrics decreased significantly after fire events. Table 4 shows the confusion matrix of classification on burned and unburned segments. Burned segments have lower user’s accuracy (81.54%) and producer’s accuracy (74.65%) compared to the unburned ones. The row sum (113) of unburned segments is larger than the column sum (107), indicating unburned segments are overestimated and burned segments are underestimated. Classification of all forest segments was shown in Figure 7a,c, where the distribution of burned segments fits burn map well.For Landsat 8 derived training data, the minimum OOB error is 21.92% with the best number of splits being 13. The overall accuracy of testing data is 76.23% and kappa is 0.5230 which are both lower than Sentinel−2 derived samples. The user’s accuracy and producer’s accuracy of burned segments are 79.79% and 68.81% (Table 4), respectively. The row sum (129) of unburned segments is larger than the column sum value (114) which means unburned segments were overestimated. Therefore, burned segments were underestimated. Classification of all forest segments is shown in Figure 7b,d.Figure 8 provides importance of all ATL08 forest segments derived with Sentinel−2 data and Landsat 8 data, respectively. The two most important metrics in both datasets are n_ca_photons (the number of canopy photons) and asr (apparent surface reflectance). These two metrics are favorable as fire consumes biomass and blackens the ground surface, resulting in significant decrease in surface reflectance and canopy biomass. In contrast, metrics such as max, RH98, RH95 and RH90 are not as important, likely because many coarse trunks and stems are still standing after fires [24]; thus, these values of burned segments are similar with the unburned ones. Moreover, height metrics are highly correlated, which makes them redundant.Other metrics, such as n_te_photons (the number of terrain photons), toc_roughness (top of canopy roughness), n_toc_photons (the number of top of canopy photons), canopy_relief (canopy relief ratio), CV (coefficient of variation), sd_ratio (standard deviation ratio) and RH50, also contributed significantly to classification, as they provide information related to canopy structure. For example, RH50 shows the median height of canopy photons, which declines with the decrease of canopy cover. The number of canopy photons in the 100 m segment is recorded by n_toc_photons, which decreases with losses of biomass. The normalized average canopy height is shown by canopy_relief, which decreases with losses of canopy photons.", 3. Results, 3.1. Burned Area Mapping by Random Forest,3
1156,"Using testing samples derived from Sentinel−2 data, the overall accuracy of classification is 74.16% and kappa is 0.4585, which are lower than Random Forest. User’s accuracy and producer’s accuracy of burned segments are 68.12% and 66.20%, respectively (Table 5). Row sum of unburned segments (109) is larger than the column sum (107). Therefore, unburned segments are overestimated and burned segments underestimated. Selected metrics were shown in Table S3 and fire probability was presented in Figure S1.As for Landsat 8 derived data, the overall accuracy and kappa are 69.51% and 0.3891, respectively, lower than the Random Forest. User’s accuracy of burned segments is 69.90% and producer’s accuracy is 66.06%. Moreover, the row sum of unburned segments (120) is larger than the column sum (114), showing that unburned segments are overestimated.", 3. Results, 3.2. Burned Area Mapping by Logistic Regression,3
1157,"dNBR values are correlated with burn severity, where high dNBR value suggests high fire severity. Random Forest regression was used to estimate dNBR. Figure 9a shows the regression result between predicted dNBR and observed dNBR using testing samples derived from Sentinel−2 forest map and burn map, where the linear relationship is significant with p < 0.001, R2 0.6072 and correlation coefficient 0.78. Another burn severity index relative differenced normalized burn ratio index (RdNBR) (=dNBR/sqrt(NBRpre-fire)) [39] was also employed in Random Forest to compare with dNBR. Linear relationship between predicted RdNBR (Figure 9c) and observed RdNBR is significant with p < 0.001, R2 0.5861. These results show the capability of using ATL08 metrics to estimate fire severity.Figure 9b shows that variation of residuals is not constant, where the divergence of points increases with dNBR first and then decreases. In Figure 9d, divergence of points also increases and then decreases. Based on thresholds in Table 3, points in Figure 9b were classified into unburned (UB), low (L), moderate-low (ML) and moderate-high (MH) severity, where high severity was missing as only one point was over 0.66 in Figure 9b. Standard deviation of each class was calculated: UB 0.1034, L 0.1764, ML 0.3034, MH 0.2292, where points in moderate low severity got highest standard deviation which means highest uncertainty.", 3.

1158,"In this study, 24 LiDAR metrics were utilized as predictors for burned ATL08 segments classification. The classification accuracy reached 83%, which shows the feasibility of using ATL08 data for burn area mapping. This study suggests that it is possible to employ spaceborne LiDAR data in fire disturbances monitoring.Optical images were used to provide a reference burn map and landcover map in previous experiments. The images were collected with the same spectral bands, from Blue band to SWIR2 band (Table 2). Given their different spatial resolution, we wanted to investigate the effect of using Landsat 8 and Sentinel−2 images on ICESat−2 segments classification. Using a Sentinel−2 derived forest map and burn map, we got 592 forest segments (including burned forest and unburned forest) from two study sites. For Landsat 8 data, there were 744 forest segments in total. Therefore, Landsat 8 data introduced many false forest segments compared with Sentinel−2 data. This phenomenon can partly explain why Landsat 8 derived segments have slightly lower classification accuracy. In Table 4, user’s accuracy and producer’s accuracy of burned segments are 81.54% and 74.65% to Sentinel−2 derived testing samples, 79.79% and 68.81% to Landsat 8 derived samples. Overall accuracies of testing samples using Random Forest are 83.15% and 76.23% for Sentinel−2 derived segments and Landsat 8 derived ones, respectively. These results demonstrate that Landsat 8 derived segments have slightly lower classification accuracy than that of Sentinel−2 derived segments. However, the accuracy of these two datasets are comparable in fire mapping, 83.15% versus 76.23%.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Comparison of Sentinel−2 and Landsat 8,4
1159,"From Table 4 and Table 5, Random Forest performs better than logistics regression in ATL08 segments classification. Random Forest classification produces higher overall accuracy and kappa than that of logistic regression. Moreover, the user’s and producer’s accuracy of burned segments are also higher in Random Forest. Therefore, it can be seen that with the same training samples and testing samples, Random Forest can get better classification results. These benefits can be attributed to the capability of data processing without statistical assumptions (e.g., parametric). However, Random Forest is a black box model, which means users do not have access to a model.In logistic regression, the stepwise procedure removes those insignificant metrics and helps to simplify the model. Although the accuracy of logistic regression is a little bit lower, it is more efficient in practice to have a simple model with acceptable accuracy.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. Comparison of Classification Methods,4
1160,"Based on Figure 8, asr (apparent surface reflectance) is the most important metric (15.65% and 24.25% in importance) in burned ATL08 segments classification, n_ca_photons (the number of canopy photons) ranking the second. Other metrics such as n_te_photons (the number of terrain photons), n_toc_photons (the number of top of canopy photons), toc_roughness (top of canopy roughness), RH60, canopy_relief (canopy relief ratio) and CV (coefficient of variation) are less important. It is reasonable that reflectance contributes to capturing vegetation characteristics and changes. In Zhao et al. [40], intensity related metrics in airborne LiDAR explained 60% of variations in leaf area index, which also illustrates the importance of reflectance.Other 23 LiDAR metrics count 84.35% and 75.57% in importance for Sentinel−2 based samples and Landsat 8 based samples, indicating the effectiveness of LiDAR data. To check the feasibility of using other LiDAR metrics in burn area classification, we removed asr and used the remaining 23 metrics to classify burned ATL08 segments, with 100% of the segments samples derived from Sentinel−2 data. Table 6 shows the OOB error (22.80%) that is acceptable without asr.In fact, reflectance of optical images (asr in ATL08) is the sum of reflected photons within a pixel from which we cannot get height information directly. However, LiDAR helps to record the height information of each photons and based on which photons are classified into canopy photons and ground photons in ATL08, producing n_ca_photons and n_te_photons. Other metrics such as toc_roughness, RH60, canopy_relief and CV are also characteristics describing the 3D canopy structure which contribute to wildfire classification.", 4. Discussion, 4.3. Comparison of LiDAR Metrics,4
1161,"The high classification accuracy shown in Table 4 reveals the feasibility of using ATL08 metrics for burned areas mapping along tracks. However, there are some limitations. First, it is unavoidable that there is time lag between the fire occurrence and acquisition of ICESat−2 data. We know the revisit time of ICESat−2 is 91 days currently. Therefore, the time lag between fire occurrence and ICESat−2 track will be around three months or two months. During the time lag, regrowth of forests after fire will reduce the difference between burned and unburned forests, causing more challenges in burned areas classification.Moreover, logging or harvesting after fire will introduce damages to forest structure. This kind of change will cause interferences to fire mapping. At first, logging will produce debris and abandoned stems which might increase surface fuels. Second, large boles are removed and the density of canopy declines. Under this situation, data collected from ATL08 cannot represent structure changes in real fire events. However, our model still works as logging decreases canopy density and canopy height.Moreover, the laser wavelength of the ICESat−2 ATLAS sensor is 532 nm, which makes it possible to be obstructed by clouds. In this case, no photons, or only very few photons, can reach the land surface when there are clouds. Therefore, only a small portion of the ICESat−2 data is suitable for land surface monitoring in the presence of clouds.", 4. Discussion, 4.4. Limitations,4
1162,"This study aims to investigate the feasibility of using ICESat−2 ATL08 data product to classify burned areas in wildfires. Both Sentinel−2 images and Landsat 8 data were used to produce reference land cover maps and burned maps. Twenty-four canopy related metrics derived from ATL08 were employed to classify burned segments with Random Forest and logistic regression, respectively. Our results indicate high classification accuracy of burned ATL08 segments based on both Sentinel−2 derived samples and Landsat 8 derived samples. Random Forest produced slightly higher classification accuracy than logistic regression. The number of canopy photons and apparent surface reflectance turned out to be the two most important metrics in classification. Metrics such as RH50, the number of top of canopy photons, coefficient of variation and canopy relief ratio are also helpful. It is anticipated that canopy related metrics will be more beneficial when differentiating fire severity as they characterize structure changes. This study demonstrates the feasibility of employing ATL08 for burned area mapping. As more ICESat−2 data accumulates over burned and unburned vegetation, and our understanding of photons description of canopy structure and ICESat−2 products such as ATL08 improve, we would expect to see more applications of using such data for assessing burned vegetation, fire severity and fuel loads. Future studies could also make use of a synergistic approach using ICESat−2 data and observations from other NASA missions, such as Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Indian Space Research Organization Synthetic Aperture Radar mission (NISAR), to improve the classification of burned and unburned areas and assess fire risk.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
1163,"Forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is the material basis with which forest ecosystems perform their ecological functions and is an important indicator of forest carbon sequestration capacity [1]. The accurate estimation of AGB could provide a significant insight in the study of global carbon cycling and climate changes [2].Traditional methods for AGB measurement, primarily field surveys, have a number of disadvantages: high labor intensity, high costs of manpower and material resources, long survey periods, and disturbance of the ecological environment [3]. As a result of its extensive coverage and superior repeatability, remote sensing technology is increasingly used for AGB estimation at regional scales. Various methods have been investigated to improve the accuracy of biomass estimation by remote sensing, including (1) larger samples [4], (2) combinations of multi-source remote sensing data [5], (3) feature selection [6,7], and (4) modeling algorithms. However, the high cost of field investigation limits the acquisition of larger sample datasets [8,9]. Remote sensing data such as hyperspectral and airborne lidar data are difficult to obtain due to high costs and regional limitations [10,11]. Previous studies have shown that a saturation phenomenon occurs in AGB estimation when using band reflectance or vegetation indices derived from multispectral data [12,13,14,15]. However, multispectral data, such as Landsat OLI data, are still widely used in AGB estimation at the regional scale and have the advantages of low cost and accessibility [14,16,17].Feature selection methods are often used for predictive models that are based on high dimensional data [18]. A variety of potential variables can be obtained from remote sensing data, including multispectral reflectance, vegetation index derived from spectral data, texture measures, and others [19,20,21]. However, high dimensionality tends to result in information redundancy and “dimensional disaster” [7]. To reduce the risk of overfitting, feature selection can be performed before constructing a model in order to extract the most important and useful information from the original dataset [22]. Li et al. evaluated stepwise regression and the variable importance-based method for the selection of an optimal subset of variables for AGB estimation using multiple stepwise regression and machine learning methods [23]. They demonstrated the potential utility of feature selection for AGB estimation, especially for machine learning algorithms. Yu et al. focused on variable selection and the model stability of a subtropical forest biomass estimation model [24]. They discussed key aspects of eight variable selection methods and pointed out that most methods differed markedly in their performance on individual indices. Therefore, further investigation of feature selection for AGB estimation is required to gather additional evidence and reach reasonable conclusions.The accuracy of AGB predictions is also affected by the regression algorithm [25]. The linear regression model is one of the most popular methods, including conventional multiple linear stepwise regression and principal component linear regression, which has a significant advantage in the prediction of forest biomass [26]. However, linear regression cannot fully capture the complex relationships between explanatory variables and AGB, accounting for its low prediction accuracy. Machine learning algorithms such as back propagation neural network, K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine (SVM), and random forests (RF) have been used to improve AGB estimation [27,28,29]. Zhao et al. investigated four machine learning algorithms, including classification regression tree (CART), artificial neural network (ANN), SVM, and RF, to estimate the parameters of a Robinia pseudoacacia L. plantation on the Loess Plateau [12]. They found that RF had the highest accuracy and the smallest error among all forest parameter estimates. Sikdar et al. evaluated two machine learning methods (RF and SVM) for biomass estimation of Sporobolus virginicus (L.) Kunth and found that the RF model (R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.166 kg/m2) outperformed the SVM model (R2 = 0.66, RMSE = 0.200 kg/m2) [7].Ensemble learning is a branch of machine learning in which learning tasks are completed by building and combining multiple learners [30,31]. It can integrate decision trees and neural networks or use decision trees or neural networks alone, and it is mainly divided into Bagging and Boosting algorithms. Bagging renders the model a high generalization by reducing the variance. RF is a popular technique in Bagging [32]. Boosting uses a set of machine learning algorithms to convert weak learners to strong learners to increase the accuracy of the model. Boosting includes adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), and categorical boosting (CatBoost). GBDT and AdaBoost are commonly used algorithms in Boosting. XGBoost and CatBoost, which are improvements of GBDT, have shown potential in fields such as biology and medicine [33,34,35,36]. Although some studies have attempted to use these methods for modeling forest properties from remote sensing data, the CatBoost method has been introduced very recently [13,37]. However, Pham et al. found that extreme gradient boosting regression-genetic algorithm (XGBR-GA) outperformed CatBoost and RFR in estimating mangrove AGB [13]. Therefore, our study is devoted to improving the performance of CatBoost in forest AGB estimation by the coupling with the feature selection.Machine learning algorithms such as RF have their own built-in feature selection functions that can be used for simultaneous feature selection and regression [38]. However, there is little evidence to indicate that a greater accuracy of AGB estimation is achieved when feature selection and regression are performed with the same algorithm. Therefore, it is worthwhile to explore the performance of AGB estimation when different feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms are combined. This study explores the following two questions: (1) What are the effects of combining different feature selection methods with different regression algorithms? (2) Does the CatBoost algorithm improve the accuracy of AGB estimation? This study focused on the estimation of AGB using the ninth National Forest Continuous Inventory (NFCI) data from Jilin Province, China and Landsat Operational Land Imager (Landsat OLI) data.The goals of this study are as follows:(1)Compare and analyze AGB prediction models of different forest types by combining three feature selection methods (recursive feature elimination (RFE), variable selection using random forests (VSURF) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)) and three regression algorithms (random forest regression (RFR), XGBoost, and CatBoost);(2)Evaluate the accuracy of the CatBoost algorithm for AGB estimation and compare it with the RFR and XGBoost algorithms;(3)Identify the best input variables for AGB estimation by feature selection.", 1.

1164,"The study was conducted across all of Jilin province (19.1 × 104 km2, 40°52′ N–46°18′ N, 121°38′ E–131°19′ E) in the central part of northeast China (Figure 2). It is characterized by hilly topography in the east and plains in the central region, and its elevation ranges from 279 to 2691 m [39]. Jilin has a temperate continental monsoon climate, with a more humid climate to the southeast and a semiarid climate in the northwest. The annual mean temperature is about 5.0 °C, with a maximum temperature of 23 °C in July and a minimum temperature of −20 °C in December. The seasonal distribution of precipitation is uneven: annual precipitation ranges from 400 to 600 mm, and 80% falls in the rainy season from June to September [40]. Natural forests form the bulk of the AGB studied in Jilin, and plantations are less common. The coniferous species are dominated by Pinus koraiensis Sieb. et. Zuccarini., followed by Picea asperata Mast. and Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica Litv. [41]. The major broadleaved species include Quercus mongolica Fischer ex Ledebour, Betula platyphylla Suk., Juglans mandshurica Maxim., Populus ussuriensis Kom., and Tilia amurensis Rupr [42].", 2.

Square sampling plots with an area of 0.06 hectares were arranged at 4 km × 8 km grid intersection points along a system of vertical and horizontal coordinates. Tree heights, diameter at breast height (DBH) of all trees greater than 5 cm, canopy density, slope, aspect, and slope position were measured. Plot types, land types, age group, and dominant tree species were also recorded. Plots that were not on forested land (cropland, water, urban land, and bare land) and those covered by clouds in the remote sensing images were excluded. The final dataset included 2716 plots (Figure 2).A continuous function was used to calculate the plot AGB, which was converted to per hectare biomass (Mg/ha) [43,44].

where B is biomass per unit area (Mg/ha); V that is the stock volume per unit area (m3/ha), was calculated according to the standing volume table method [45], and a and b are parameters whose specific values are given in Table 1.According to the technical regulations for the continuous forest inventory of China, the plots were classified into three types (coniferous forest, broad-leaved forest, and mixed forest) based on the standing volume of tree species (Table 2) [23]. The AGB values of all plots (abbreviated as “All” in tables and figures) ranged from 19.20 Mg/ha to 309.58 Mg/ha with an average of 153.8Mg/ha and a standard deviation of 49.58 Mg/ha. The average AGB values of coniferous, broadleaf, and mixed plots were 103.32, 155.60, and 186.86 Mg/ha, respectively (Table 3). 2.2.2. Remote Sensing Data Collection and PreprocessingThe remote sensing data used in this study were acquired from the Landsat OLI satellite and included one band in the panchromatic mode and eight bands in the multispectral mode. Landsat OLI images with cloud cover less than 5% were acquired on the GEE platform (https://earthengine.google.com/, accessed on 15 May 2020) from June to September of 2014. Data preprocessing steps were performed on the GEE platform, including radiation correction, terrain correction, cloud removal, image splicing, and atmospheric apparent reflectance conversion [46]. A total of 18 Landsat OLI images were obtained, covering the entire study area. Band 1-coastal and band 9-Cirrus were excluded, as Band 1 and Band 9 are used as indicators of coastal zone observation and cloud detection, respectively. Although the images were resampled to a pixel size of 25.82 m, the same size as the inventory plot, there are certain positional offsets between the boundary of the sample site and the remote sensing image. To reduce the impact of these positional offsets, a buffer zone with a radius of 25.82 m was established around each plot. Then, the mean pixels of each plot center buffer are extracted as the sample plot value.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.2. Data Collection and Preprocessing,2

1169,"Feature selection is one of the critical steps in machine learning and has two main functions: (1) reducing the number of features and dimensions, thereby enhancing model generalizability and reducing overfitting, and (2) enhancing the understanding between features and eigenvalues. RFE, VSURF, and LASSO were applied to the original dataset to determine the appropriate variable number. 2.4.1. Recursive Feature EliminationRFE is a well-established wrapper method to find the optimal feature subset [49]; it repeatedly constructs models and finally selects the best predicted feature set. The best or worst features are removed on the basis of coefficients, and the remaining features are used to build the next model until all features have been used. Finally, the features are sorted according to their order of elimination. To determine the best number of features, a 10-fold cross-validation resampling method was added to RFE. The ‘rfe ()’ function in the ‘caret’ package (version: 6.0-84) was used to implement RFE on R 3.5.3, with ‘Repeatedcv’ for method, ‘5’ for repeats, and ‘random forests (rfFuncs)’ for functions. 2.4.2. Variable Selection Using Random ForestsVSURF is a wrapper-based algorithm that uses random forests as the base classifier [50]. Feature variables are first ranked based on a variable importance measure, and low-scoring features are eliminated to reduce the number of features and improve model accuracy [51].

The ‘cv.glmnet’ function of the ‘glmnet’ package (version: 2.0-18) of R is used for LASSO feature selection. ‘cv.glmnet’ uses a 10-fold cross-validation method for verification, which is more suitable for feature selection with high-dimensional data.", 2.

1173," 2.5.1. Random Forest RegressionRFR is an ensemble learning technique proposed by Breiman in 2001 [53]. This multiple decision tree algorithm is based on classification and regression trees and is controlled by the number of decision trees (Ntree) and the number of nodes (Mtry) [54]. The complexity of the model is directly proportional to Ntree. Therefore, if prediction accuracy is similar, a smaller Ntree is better than a larger Ntree. Mtry controls the degree of randomness introduction, and its value is generally one-third of the number of input variables in the regression model [55,56]. The optimal variables are selected through successive modeling calculations. RFR has the advantages of processing high-dimensional data, avoiding overfitting, and ranking the importance of features. 2.5.2.

1178,"Different forest types showed different RMSE trends as the input variable number changed in the RFE feature selection method (Figure 3). The number of selected features differed among the different forest types. For coniferous forest, the optimal number of features was five, whereas 10, 21, and 25 features were selected for the broadleaf forest, the mixed forest, and all forests.For VSURF, the OOB error values decreased continuously as the variable number increased from 0 to 20 but changed only slightly as the variable number increased from 20 to 52. The variation trend for LASSO was similar to that of VSURF. After comprehensive consideration, 20 was a suitable variable number that maintained most of the information from the original dataset, and VSURF and LASSO selected the top 20 features with the highest scores.", 3.

1179," 3.2.1. Variable Importance MeasuresWe calculated Pearson correlation coefficients between the predictor variables and AGB and found that the T9Mea texture measure had the highest correlation coefficient (−0.61). The correlation coefficients between most texture measures and AGB were 0.2–0.5. Band4 (red) had the highest correlation with AGB among the spectral variables, with a value of −0.57. RVI64 had the highest correlation with AGB among the vegetation indexes, with a value of −0.54. The correlation coefficients of elevation, slope, and canopy density with AGB were 0.56, 0.46, and 0.24, respectively.The AGB models constructed by combining different feature selection methods (RFE, VSURF, LASSO) and machine learning algorithms (RFR, XGBoost, CatBoost) had different orders of feature importance. Figure 4 shows the top 10 selected prediction features based on feature importance for the different forest types obtained with the RFE feature selection method and the three machine learning algorithms. Spectral variables, vegetation indexes, texture measures, terrain factors, and the forest factor were included in most of the AGB models for all forests (All), although the specific selected variables differed. This result indicated that multiple features, rather than a single feature, influenced AGB estimation.Five features were selected in the coniferous forest model: T9Mea, B3-Green, Elevation, B7-SWIR2, and Canopy. T9Mea, Elevation, and Canopy were also frequently selected for the AGB models of broadleaf forest, indicating that these features have significant roles in AGB estimation. Canopy and elevation were the two most important features in all mixed forest models. In AGB models of all forests, the three most important variables were Canopy, T7Mea, and Elevation for the RFE-RFR model; T9Mea, Canopy, and Elevation for the RFE-XGBoost model; and Canopy, Elevation, and T7Mea for the RFE-CatBoost model. Canopy and Elevation were included in all AGB models, indicating that both features contained sufficient information to enhance the performance of AGB estimation models.Textures based on 7 × 7 and 9 × 9 window sizes were frequently involved in the models, indicating that these two window sizes were more appropriate for AGB estimation. Window size is an important factor that affects the accuracy of the AGB estimation model. Small windows are more sensitive to the pixel difference between canopy and shadow ratio, whereas large windows cannot extract sufficient texture information due to the excessive smoothness phenomenon of texture parameters. Mean texture was frequently involved in the model, indicating that Mean contributed more than other texture measures.Figure A1 presents the rankings of the top 10 AGB model variables obtained when LASSO was combined with the machine learning algorithms, and Figure A2 presents the results obtained when VSURF was used. Similar to RFE, all types of features (spectral variables, vegetation indexes, texture measures, terrain factors, and the forest factor) were involved in the AGB models when LASSO and VSURF were used for feature selection. However, the specific variables selected were different. Spectral variables, vegetation indexes, and texture measures played different roles in the AGB models of broadleaf, mixed, and coniferous forests. The spectral and vegetation index variables could be used to distinguish broadleaf and mixed forests, owing to their diversity of tree species and multiple canopy layers. By contrast, because the coniferous forest was dominated by a small number of species, its AGB could be explained well by texture rather than spectral information. It was interesting to note that canopy density contributed significantly to the models for most forest types, especially in broadleaf and mixed. This likely reflects the fact that forest canopy structure was complex and diverse. 3.2.2. Comparison of Model PerformanceThe key tuning hyperparameters and the configurations of the tuning parameters for 36 AGB models are shown in Table A1. Three machine learning algorithms, RFR, XGBoost, and CatBoost, were used to fit the modeling dataset based on the RFE feature selection method, and the results are presented in Table 5. Comprehensive consideration based on the accuracy indicators (R2, RMSE, RMSE%, and Bias), CatBoost was the best machine learning algorithm. For the coniferous forest, the CatBoost algorithm produced more accurate estimates (with RMSE of 26.54 Mg/ha) than the RFR (with RMSE of 26.63 Mg/ha) and XGBoost (with RMSE of 28.81 Mg/ha) algorithms. CatBoost also achieved the lowest RMSE values for different forest types except for mixed forest compared with the other algorithms. Interestingly, sometimes the Bias of the RFR is lower than CatBoost. One possible explanation is that the positive and negative predicted values cancel each other out in the RFR algorithm. The ensemble learning algorithms (XGBoost and CatBoost) have shown potential in fields such as biology and medicine [13,33,34,35,36]. Here, we found that CatBoost turns out to be a promising method for modeling forest AGB using remote sensing data.Table 6 presents the estimate accuracy of AGB models in which LASSO was combined with the machine learning algorithms, and Table 7 presents the results obtained using VSURF. For all forest types, models that used RFE-based selection clearly performed better than models that used VSURF or LASSO. For example, for broadleaf, the RMSE of VSURF-selected models (24.77, 25.62, and 25.08 Mg/ha) and LASSO-selected models (25.11, 26.16, and 25.54 Mg/ha) were much larger than those of RFE-selected models (24.67, 25.55, and 24.74 Mg/ha). These results indicate that the RFE-selected dataset retained more useful information from the original dataset, thereby explaining the differences in AGB estimation. The best AGB model predictions were obtained when RFE was combined with the CatBoost algorithm. Moreover, the RFE–CatBoost model (RFE used for feature selection and CatBoost used for regression) performed well in prediction accuracy compared to the VSURF-RFR model (in which random forests were used for both feature selection and regression) for all forest types. This result indicates that the typical method of simultaneous feature selection and regression with the same machine learning algorithm may not always ensure an optimal estimate. The combination of different feature selection and regression algorithms was helpful in improving the accuracy of the AGB model.", 3. Results, 3.2. Predictive Performance Using Feature Selection,3

Mean texture was frequently involved in the model, indicating that Mean contributed more than other texture measures.Figure A1 presents the rankings of the top 10 AGB model variables obtained when LASSO was combined with the machine learning algorithms, and Figure A2 presents the results obtained when VSURF was used. Similar to RFE, all types of features (spectral variables, vegetation indexes, texture measures, terrain factors, and the forest factor) were involved in the AGB models when LASSO and VSURF were used for feature selection. However, the specific variables selected were different. Spectral variables, vegetation indexes, and texture measures played different roles in the AGB models of broadleaf, mixed, and coniferous forests. The spectral and vegetation index variables could be used to distinguish broadleaf and mixed forests, owing to their diversity of tree species and multiple canopy layers. By contrast, because the coniferous forest was dominated by a small number of species, its AGB could be explained well by texture rather than spectral information. It was interesting to note that canopy density contributed significantly to the models for most forest types, especially in broadleaf and mixed. This likely reflects the fact that forest canopy structure was complex and diverse.", 3. Results, 3.2.1. Variable Importance Measures,3
1181,"The key tuning hyperparameters and the configurations of the tuning parameters for 36 AGB models are shown in Table A1. Three machine learning algorithms, RFR, XGBoost, and CatBoost, were used to fit the modeling dataset based on the RFE feature selection method, and the results are presented in Table 5. Comprehensive consideration based on the accuracy indicators (R2, RMSE, RMSE%, and Bias), CatBoost was the best machine learning algorithm. For the coniferous forest, the CatBoost algorithm produced more accurate estimates (with RMSE of 26.54 Mg/ha) than the RFR (with RMSE of 26.63 Mg/ha) and XGBoost (with RMSE of 28.81 Mg/ha) algorithms. CatBoost also achieved the lowest RMSE values for different forest types except for mixed forest compared with the other algorithms. Interestingly, sometimes the Bias of the RFR is lower than CatBoost. One possible explanation is that the positive and negative predicted values cancel each other out in the RFR algorithm. The ensemble learning algorithms (XGBoost and CatBoost) have shown potential in fields such as biology and medicine [13,33,34,35,36]. Here, we found that CatBoost turns out to be a promising method for modeling forest AGB using remote sensing data.Table 6 presents the estimate accuracy of AGB models in which LASSO was combined with the machine learning algorithms, and Table 7 presents the results obtained using VSURF. For all forest types, models that used RFE-based selection clearly performed better than models that used VSURF or LASSO. For example, for broadleaf, the RMSE of VSURF-selected models (24.77, 25.62, and 25.08 Mg/ha) and LASSO-selected models (25.11, 26.16, and 25.54 Mg/ha) were much larger than those of RFE-selected models (24.67, 25.55, and 24.74 Mg/ha). These results indicate that the RFE-selected dataset retained more useful information from the original dataset, thereby explaining the differences in AGB estimation. The best AGB model predictions were obtained when RFE was combined with the CatBoost algorithm. Moreover, the RFE–CatBoost model (RFE used for feature selection and CatBoost used for regression) performed well in prediction accuracy compared to the VSURF-RFR model (in which random forests were used for both feature selection and regression) for all forest types. This result indicates that the typical method of simultaneous feature selection and regression with the same machine learning algorithm may not always ensure an optimal estimate. The combination of different feature selection and regression algorithms was helpful in improving the accuracy of the AGB model.", 3. Results, 3.2.2. Comparison of Model Performance,3
1182,"The scatter plots shown in Figure 5 illustrate the relationships between predicted and observed AGB for different forest types using the RFR, XGBoost, and CatBoost algorithms with the RFE variable selection method. The CatBoost algorithm was superior to the RFR and XGBoost algorithms. Within a given algorithm, the accuracy of the broadleaf model is the highest, followed by the all and mixed models, the coniferous model being the least accurate.", 3. Results, 3.3. Evaluation of AGB Estimation,3
1183,"Feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms were effective tools for improving the accuracy of AGB estimates. To predict the AGB of four forest types, 36 models were derived using three feature selection methods (RFE, VSURF, and LASSO) and three machine learning algorithms (RFR, XGBoost, and CatBoost) based on NFCI data. CatBoost performed well in the prediction of all forest types compared to XGBoost and RFR. AGB models were most accurate when RFE was used for feature selection, and this method worked better than VSURF or LASSO. The combination of RFE feature selection with the CatBoost algorithm effectively improved the accuracy of AGB estimates. Since feature selection can reduce data dimensionality, minimize data storage space, and improve model interpretability, it has been employed to improve the performance of predictive models. RFE showed the smallest RMSE, followed by VSURF and LASSO. The first five features selected for the RFE-RFR-Broadleaf model were Elevation, Canopy, T9Mea, RVI64, and B3-green. This result demonstrated that the feature selection method effectively selected different types of features, including spectral variables, vegetation indexes, texture measures, terrain factors, and the forest factor, confirming its applicability and effectiveness for AGB estimation from multispectral data. In this study, there is a high correlation between the Mean texture and AGB. It seems likely that these results are in fact due to the reflection of the regularity of the image texture in the Mean texture. The image texture rules of different tree species are quite different; thus, the average image texture can better reflect the tree species diversity in the study area. The Mean texture contains the information on the species of the tree and is beneficial to the diversity prediction of the forest tree species, which is consistent with the finding of Li et al. [63]. Canopy density was proved to have an effect on the accuracy of the AGB estimation. There are many types of trees in the study area, and the variance in the growth status of those tree species leads to the change in the canopy density. A high canopy density can be attributed to the lush of the forest and a high AGB. In a study conducted by Li et al. [63], AGB and LAI were estimated based on digital aerial photograph data in northeast China. When the results were analyzed, it was found that the canopy density extracted from photogrammetric point cloud is the most strongly related to the estimated LAI. However, the underlying mechanisms and relationships should be studied in more detail in the future. The results of the present study agree to a large extent with those of previous studies [6,7,13]. The feature selection capability of RFE has been reported in recent studies of halophyte biomass estimation based on WorldView-2 multispectral data (Rasel et al. [7].) and forest parameter prediction using optical data (Dan Li et al. [63]). The VSURF feature selection method implements a feature selection function by measuring the importance of features [18]. Specifically, it produces a set of feature scores ranked from largest to smallest, rather than an optimal feature combination. A feature set is the final result of RFE, which more fully conveys the information from the original dataset. In addition, the stability of RFE was enhanced owing to the use of “random forests” as the underlying model for RFE during iteration.The application of machine learning algorithms to optical data processing in quantitative remote sensing is developing rapidly. However, there have been few applications of new ensemble learning algorithms to AGB estimation. Here, the CatBoost algorithm was shown to be superior to XGBoost, but it was only slightly superior to RFR. The RFR algorithm, a parallel integrated algorithm, is not sensitive to predictive variables that contain noise, as the decision tree is independent [64,65]. The decision tree of XGBoost is generated based on the previous tree and improves the processing of regularized learning targets to avoid overfitting [60]. In contrast to XGBoost, CatBoost can avoid overfitting by adding an algorithm to compute leaf nodes when choosing a tree structure [62]. Consequently, CatBoost not only performed well on the validation set but also had the lowest degree of overfitting on the validation set. For example, the RFE-ALL-RFR (R2 = 0.96, RMSE = 10.50 Mg/ha) model outperformed RFE-ALL-CatBoost (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 21.76 Mg/ha) in the training dataset, but RFE-ALL-CatBoost (R2 = 0.73, RMSE=25.77 Mg/ha) turned out to be better than RFE-ALL-RFR (R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 26.13 Mg/ha) in the validation dataset. CatBoost also had a faster run time than XGBoost, thus improving the efficiency of the operation. In addition, CatBoost works faster in large samples. In the coniferous (n = 358) and mixed (n = 247), RFR was slightly faster than CatBoost. However, in broadleaf (n = 2111) and ALL (n = 2716), CatBoost runs much faster than RFR (Table 5, Table 6 and Table 7). This finding is in line with the results reported by Zhang et al., which show that the CatBoost algorithm outperformed the RFR and GBRT algorithms for the AGB estimation [37]. Li et al. focused on the potential for machine learning algorithms to improve AGB estimation accuracy [23]. Interestingly, our results showed only a slight difference in prediction performance between XGBoost and RFR, whereas Li et al. reported better results for XGBoost. The different feature selection method used in our study may explain the differences in our results.The AGB prediction models based on a combination of different feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms were superior to those in which one machine learning algorithm was used for both feature selection and regression. For example, the RFE-CatBoost-Coniferous model (RMSE = 26.54 Mg/ha) outperformed the VSURF-RFR-Coniferous model (RMSE = 27.44 Mg/ha). Previous studies on LAI estimation also reported that using the same machine learning algorithm for both feature selection and regression was not always the optimal solution. It is interesting to note that Chen et al. found the VSURF-RFR model to be the best, although in this case, the study object and the method of comparison were different [38]. Overall, our experiment indicates that using the same machine learning algorithm for feature selection and regression does not improve AGB estimation accuracy. There are two likely causes for such a result. One possible explanation for this might be that the scores are adopted by the RF algorithm as the criterion for feature selection. However, most of the scores only represent the correlation between one particular input variable and the AGB. Therefore, it does not guarantee that the combination of variables with high scores would be the optimal choice for AGB estimation. Additionally, the feature selection process was conducted twice duo to the employment of the combination of the feature selection method and the regression algorithm.Here, the combination of CatBoost algorithm and feature selection methods was applied to AGB prediction for the first time and achieved the best performance. In this regard, the combination of different feature selection methods and regression algorithms can be considered as a powerful tool in AGB prediction. This tool could be extended to other fields of forest ecology, for example, predicting other biophysical parameters (leaf area index, forest canopy coverage rate, and effective canopy coverage rate), soil nutrient or soil heavy metal content using optical and hyperspectral remote sensing data. To some readers, machine learning methods (especially neural networks) seem like a black box. The three machine learning algorithms (RFR, XGBoost, and CatBoost) selected in our study are easier to understand in the steps of modeling and interpretation. With the advent of the era of big data, more data sources and larger amounts of data are available in the forest ecology field. Machine learning approaches can overcome the disadvantages of traditional approaches in dealing with big data.Several previous studies have emphasized the effects of ecological conditions, canopy closure, and soil background on AGB estimation [4,17,26,66]. Here, the CatBoost algorithm made a significant improvement to the AGB model. However, the problems of low value overestimation and high value underestimation that have been reported in previous studies have not been completely solved [4,26,67]. All the algorithms underestimated the AGB observed values when the AGB values were larger than about 200 Mg/ha (Figure 5). On the one hand, the factors affecting AGB estimation are complex. In our study, original spectral variables, vegetation index, texture features and topographic factors are included, but there are also some potentially important variables affecting AGB prediction, such as climate factors, etc. On the other hand, the Landsat OLI data itself has a number of limitations, including a low resolution of 30 m and the obvious mixed pixel phenomenon [32,68]. For plots with low AGB values, the reflectance of spectral bands is affected by ground vegetation and soil. For plots with high AGB values, the multispectral sensors become saturated [47]. Further research is needed to improve AGB estimation with feature selection methods and machine learning algorithms based on hyperspectral, high-resolution optical, and lidar data.", 4. Discussion,None,4
1184,"We used three feature selection methods (RFE, VSURF, and LASSO) and three machine learning algorithms (RFR, XGBoost, and CatBoost) to develop AGB estimation models for different forest types. The CatBoost algorithm was applied to AGB prediction from optical remote sensing data for the first time.The following conclusions can be drawn:(1)Feature selection has a significant influence on the predictive performance of the AGB models. The RFE algorithm is one of the most appropriate feature selection methods for AGB estimation from optical remote sensing data.(2)The CatBoost algorithm better than the XGBoost and RFR algorithms and has great potential for AGB prediction.(3)Using the same machine learning algorithm for feature selection and regression is not always the best approach for AGB estimation. Combining separate feature selection methods with regression algorithms can improve the accuracy of AGB model estimates. The AGB estimations in which RFE was the feature selection method and CatBoost was the regression algorithm achieved greater accuracy, with RMSEs of 26.54 Mg/ha for the coniferous forest, 24.67 Mg/ha for the broad-leaved forest, 22.62 Mg/ha for the mixed forest, and 25.77 Mg/ha for all forests.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
1185,"Precise and unambiguous forest type identification is essential when evaluating forest ecological systems for environmental management practices. Forests are the largest land-based carbon pool accounting for about 85% of the total land vegetation biomass [1]. Soil carbon stocks in the forest are as high as 73% of the global soil carbon [2]. As the biggest biological resource reservoir, forests play an irreplaceable role in ecosystem management for climate change abatement, environmental improvement and ecological security [3,4,5]. A common issue in climate change mitigation is to reduce forest damage and increase forest resources [6], which can be measured by the precise estimation of carbon storage based on accurate mapping of forest types. Traditional forest survey methods involve random sampling and field investigation within each sample plot, a time-consuming and laborious process [7,8]. Remote sensing technology can be used to obtain forest information from areas with rough terrain or that are difficult to reach, complementing traditional methods while at the same time reducing the need for fieldwork. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the potential of multi-source remote sensing data to obtain explicit and detailed information of forest types.Many remote sensing datasets have been explored to identify forest types and have obtained acceptable classification results. High-resolution images acquired from WordView-2 satellite sensors were used to map forest types in Burgenland, Austria, achieving promising results [9]. However, high-resolution images are often expensive. Besides high-resolution images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is also conducive to forest mapping, as the microwave energy generated by SAR satellite sensors can penetrate into forests and interact with different parts of trees, producing big volume scattering. Qin et al. [10] demonstrated the potential of integrating PALSAR and MODIS images to map forests in large areas. In addition, topographic information has a strong correlation with the spatial distribution of forest types [11]. Strahler et al. [12] demonstrated that accuracies of species-specific forest type classification from Landsat imagery can be improved by 27% or more by adding topographic information. Other previous studies also showed that topographic information can improve the overall accuracy of forest type classification by more than 10% [13,14]. Topographic information can be represented by a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) or variables derived from a DEM [13]. Beyond these datasets, Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data have been used to identify forest type in combination with multispectral and hyperspectral images, because the multispectral and hyperspectral sensor can capture the subtle differences of leaf morphology among different forest types and the instrument of LiDAR can detect the different vertical structures of different forest types [15]. These studies using high-resolution images, SAR data, DEM images or the combination of LiDAR and multispectral/hyperspectral images have proven their potential to classify forest types. However, the biggest limitations of these datasets are high cost and low temporal resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the potential of free data to identify forest types, especially the potential for the configuration of multi-source free image data.Most studies focused on forest type identification use remote sensing data obtained from a single or maybe two sensor types, and only a few studies concentrate on evaluating the ability of multi-source images acquired from three or more sensors to identify forest types [16]. One existing study was carried out in [17], which evaluated the potential of Sentinel-2A to classify seven forest types in Bavaria, Germany, based on object-oriented random forest classification and obtained approximately 66% overall accuracy. Ji et al. [18] reported that the phenology-informed composite image was more effective for classifying forest types than a single scene image as the composite image captured within-scene variations in forest type phenology. Zhu et al. [19] mapped forest types using dense seasonal Landsat time-series. The results showed that time-series data improved the accuracy of forest type mapping by about 12%, indicating that phenology information as contained in multi-seasonal images can discriminate between different forest types. However, the accuracy of the classification for seven major forest types was between 60% and 70%, thus a lower accuracy for forest type identification [17,20]. Therefore, imagery acquired from a single sensor may not be sufficient for forest-type mapping. Multi-sensor images might compensate for the information missing from a single sensor and improve the accuracy of classification [7,10,21]. Meanwhile, forest type classification using multi-temporal imagery can also achieve better classification results than using single-period images [7,22,23]. However, there are few studies on forest-type mapping based on the freely-available multi-source and time-series imagery.Concerning classification algorithms, Object-Based Image Classification (OBIC) is very appealing for the purpose of land cover identification. OBIC can fuse multiple sources of data at different spatial resolutions [24] and be used to further improve the result of classification [25,26]. Random Forest (RF) is a highly flexible ensemble learning method and has been getting more and more attention in the classification of remote sensing [24,27,28,29]. RF can effectively handle high-dimensional, very noisy and multi-source datasets without over-fitting [30,31] and achieve higher classification accuracy than other well-known classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) [28,32], while the estimated importance of variables in the classification can be used to analyze the input features [33]. Moreover, RF is a simple classifier for parameter settings and requires no sophisticated parameter tuning.Based on the zero cost of Sentinel-2A, DEM, time-series Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A imagery in our study, we aimed to evaluate the potential to map forest types by the random forest approach in Wuhan, China. We address the following four research questions: (1) which satellite imagery is more suitable for classifying forest types, the Sentinel-2A or Landsat-8 imagery? (2) How does the DEM contribute to the forest type identification? (3) Can the combined use of multi-temporal images acquired from Landsat-8, Sentinel-2A and DEM significantly improve the classification results? (4) Can the Sentinel-1A contribute to the improvement of classification accuracy?", 1. Introduction,None,1.
1186,"The study area illustrated in Figure 1, covering an area of 226,100 ha, is located in Wuhan, south-central China (30°37′–31°22′ N, 114°08′–114°37′ E, WGS84), where the terrain is a combination of the Jianghan plain and hills at an altitude between 16.5 and 850 m above sea level. The northern part of our study site includes the Dabie Mountains with an altitude between 150 and 850 m above sea level. The central part is the plain hillocks, with an elevation between 30 and 150 m. The south is a plain lake area with an altitude of fewer than 30 m. This study area belongs to the subtropical monsoon climate with abundant rainfall and sunlight. The average annual duration of sunlight is approximately 1917 h, and the average annual precipitation is about 1202 mm. This is an area in south-central China where precipitation is distributed throughout the year, rather than concentrated into one or more seasons. In this study area, the four single-dominant forest types are Chinese red pine (Pinus massoniana, L.), China fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata, L.), German oak (Quercus acutissima, Carruth) and Chinese white poplar (Populus lasiocarpa, Oliv), while the mixed forest types are mixed sclerophyllous broad-leaved forest, mixed soft broad-leaved forest, mixed broad-leaved forest and mixed coniferous forest [34,35], leading to the basis for classifying these forest types.", 2.

1187,"The multi-spectral image data are elaborated in Section 2.2.1; the SAR data are described in Section 2.2.2; the DEM data derived from SRTM are introduced in Section 2.2.3; and a detailed explanation for the reference data is in Section 2.2.4. 2.2.1. Multi-Spectral ImagesThe Multi-Spectral Image (MSI) data used in this study are Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images. A brief overview of our image datasets is listed in Table 1.The Multispectral Sentinel-2A Images were collected by the Sentinel-2 satellite. This is a wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging mission, supporting land monitoring research; the data complement imagery from other missions, such as Landsat and SPOT imagery. The Sentinel-2 constellation includes two identical satellites (Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B). The Sentinel-2A satellite was launched on 23 June 2015 by the European Space Agency (ESA), while the Sentinel-2B launch was successfully completed in 2017. The revisit frequency of each satellite is 10 days, and the combined constellation revisit is five days. The Sentinel-2A satellite carries a state-of-the-art multispectral imager instrument with 13 spectral bands. Four bands have a spatial resolution of 10 m (blue: 490 nm, green: 560 nm, red: 665 nm and NIR: 842 nm); six bands have a spatial resolution of 20 m (red edge 1: 705 nm, red edge 2: 740 nm, red edge 3: 783 nm, narrow NIR: 865 nm, SWIR1: 1610 nm and SWIR2: 2190 nm); and three bands have a spatial resolution of 60 m (coastal aerosol: 443 nm, water vapor: 940 nm and SWIR_cirrus: 1375 nm). We used the Sentinel-2A bands with spatial resolutions of 10 m and 20 m in this study.Two cloud-free Sentinel-2A MSI granules used in the study were freely acquired on 28 August and 7 September 2016 and downloaded from the Copernicus Scientific Data Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) as a Level-1C product. These two images contain three scenes and fourteen scenes, respectively, and details can be found in Table 2. The seventeen acquired Sentinel-2A images covered the study area and were collected in the leaf-on seasons, thus being conducive to forest type identification. We assume that there were no significant changes in the forested area during this period. The Level-1C product is composed of 100 × 100 km2 tiles (ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection). The Level-1C product results from using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to project the image in UTM projection and WGS84 geodetic system.The Landsat-8 satellite was launched on 11 February 2013. Onboard are the operational land imager (OLI) and the thermal infrared sensor (TIRS), bringing new data and continuity to the Landsat program. The image produced by the OLI sensor is composed of nine spectral bands, of which eight bands have a spatial resolution of 30 m (coastal: 443 nm, blue: 485 nm, green: 563 nm, red: 655 nm, NIR: 865 nm, SWIR1: 1610 nm, SWIR2: 2200 nm and cirrus: 1375 nm). The system also provides a single, panchromatic band at a spatial resolution of 15 m. Only the first seven bands are used in our experiments. Table 2 shows the details of the nine images, including date acquired, the path and row and the percentage of cloud cover.The nine Landsat-8 images listed in Table 3 were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer web (https://glovis.usgs.gov/) as a standard Level-1 topographic corrected (LT1) product with the UTM/WGS84 projection. The nine images belong to two different seasons (leaf-off and growing). Each season, we should collect three images to cover the whole study area. We assume that there were no significant changes for the ground features during different periods of the same season. 2.2.2. Synthetic Aperture Radar DataThe Sentinel-1 mission, a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite, is comprised of two polar-orbiting satellites (1A, 1B) with a 6-day repeat cycle, operating day and night performing C-band synthetic aperture radar imaging, enabling the system to acquire imagery regardless of the weather. Sentinel-1A was successfully launched by ESA in April 2014, and Sentinel-1B was launched in April 2016. It supports operation in single-polarization (HH or VV) and dual-polarization (HH + HV or VV + VH); the products are available in three models (SM, IW and EW) suitable for Level-0, Level-1 and Level-2 processing. The SAR data for our research are shown in Table 3.As presented in Table 4, three Sentinel-1A IW Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) images, with a spatial resolution of 5 m by 20 m, were acquired on 22 and 27 August 2016 from the official website (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/). These images will be further processed and used to map the forest types. 2.2.3. SRTM One Arc-Second DEMThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) is an international research effort that obtained digital elevation models on a near-global scale between 60° N and 56° S, with a specially modified radar system onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour, collected during the 11-day STS-99 mission in February 2000. SRTM successfully gathered radar data for over 80% of the Earth’s surface with data points sampled at every one arc-second. The resulting Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was released under the name SRTM1 at a spatial resolution of 30 m; another version was released as SRTM3 at a 90-m resolution. These data are currently distributed free of charge by the USGS and available for downloading from the National Map Seamless Data Distribution System or the USGS FTP site. These data are provided in an effort to promote the use of geospatial science and applications for sustainable development and resource conservation. Five SRTM1 DEM images (n31e114, n30e115, n30e114, n30e113 and n29e114) covering our study area were acquired from the USGS Earth Explorer (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), and used to extract topographic features, which can improve the results of forest type classification [11], especially when combined with spectral features [12,13]. 2.2.4. Reference DataTo obtain reference data of pure and homogeneous stands of a forest type, a forest inventory map created in 2008 was used, which is a survey of forest resources and contains characteristics of dominant forest types, such as average height, Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), volume, age, canopy density, topographic factors and forest management type. The forest management type can be summarized as two types: one is commercial forest used for mainly developing economic benefit, and the other is ecological public welfare forest for green landscape and climate adjustment. In additional, most of the forest area in the study site is located in a biological reserve and belongs to the ecological public welfare forest, where the surface coverage is relatively difficult to change. The reference samples are manually outlined from the ecological public welfare forest type. Furthermore, in order to confirm whether the forestland type in the sample area has been changed, we also have a visual inspection of the high-resolution imagery of Google Earth in the same period. Thus, the used forest inventory data from 2008 have little negative influence on our results. The main forest types in the study area are four single-dominant forest types and four mixed forest types. Table 5 shows the details of the reference data (samples).As can be seen from Table 5, two lines labeled as forest and non-forest (in the second column) describe the samples used for forest and non-forest classification, while the other eight lines record the samples used for classifying eight forest types. Considering that the mixed forest types may occur at the boundary of the plot acquired from forest inventory data and geometric correction error, we used a size of 9 × 9 pixels at the center of the plots as training and validation data. For the four single-dominant forest types, each polygon consists of an individual forest type. In the case of the four mixed forest types, each polygon consists of a group of adjacent forest types. As illustrated in Figure 2, the selected reference data were well distributed throughout the study site, and the forest categories of samples are Pinus massoniana (PIMA), Cunninghamia lanceolata (CULA), Quercus acutissima (QUAC), Populus lasiocarpa (POLA), Sclerophyllous Broad-Leaved (SCBL), Soft Broad-Leaved (SOBL), Broad-Leaved (BRLE) and Coniferous (CONI).The reference data, shown in Figure 2, are manually outlined using the forest inventory map. In this study, we randomly and manually selected 3/4 of the sample data in each class evenly distributed in the study site as training data, while the rest for accuracy verification. The size of samples for each class varied from 25.11 ha–175.77 ha, and the size description of each class is listed in Table 5. The well-distributed samples and random selection strategy can be more robust and reliable for classification. Figure 3 shows the mean spectral reflectance of the eight forest types within the delineated reference polygons on images of Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8. It can be seen that the spectral values of different forest types in Landsat-8 imagery vary more than the Sentinel-2A data in the visible light bands, but opposite in the SWIR bands. In addition, the forest type discrimination ability of Sentinel-2A images is better than Landsat-8 in the red-edge and near-infrared bands. What is more, the spectral values of Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 imagery vary less in the visible light bands than the red-edge and near-infrared bands. Therefore, the red-edge and near-infrared bands are often regarded as the best bands to distinguish forest species. As expected, the spectral values of the broadleaf trees, such as POLA, SOBL, SCBL, BRLE and QUAC, are higher than the coniferous trees, such as CONI, CULA, and PIMA [36]. In addition, POLA has the highest spectral reflectance in the near-infrared band, while PIMA has the lowest in Figure 3a. SCBL has different spectral values in the near-infrared band. QUAC and BRLE are very similar in all seven bands in Figure 3b. However, the difference of spectral values between QUAC and BRLE is obvious in the near-infrared band of Sentinel-2A; thus, the configuration of Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 images is conducive to forest type identification. The spectral reflectance of forest types gradually decreased in the red-edge and near-infrared bands and increased from late summer to high autumn in other bands [7,8]. Therefore, adding the phenology information can contribute to forest type identification.", 2. Materials, 2.2. Data Acquisition and Preprocessing,2

Four bands have a spatial resolution of 10 m (blue: 490 nm, green: 560 nm, red: 665 nm and NIR: 842 nm); six bands have a spatial resolution of 20 m (red edge 1: 705 nm, red edge 2: 740 nm, red edge 3: 783 nm, narrow NIR: 865 nm, SWIR1: 1610 nm and SWIR2: 2190 nm); and three bands have a spatial resolution of 60 m (coastal aerosol: 443 nm, water vapor: 940 nm and SWIR_cirrus: 1375 nm). We used the Sentinel-2A bands with spatial resolutions of 10 m and 20 m in this study.Two cloud-free Sentinel-2A MSI granules used in the study were freely acquired on 28 August and 7 September 2016 and downloaded from the Copernicus Scientific Data Hub (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) as a Level-1C product. These two images contain three scenes and fourteen scenes, respectively, and details can be found in Table 2. The seventeen acquired Sentinel-2A images covered the study area and were collected in the leaf-on seasons, thus being conducive to forest type identification. We assume that there were no significant changes in the forested area during this period. The Level-1C product is composed of 100 × 100 km2 tiles (ortho-images in UTM/WGS84 projection). The Level-1C product results from using a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) to project the image in UTM projection and WGS84 geodetic system.The Landsat-8 satellite was launched on 11 February 2013. Onboard are the operational land imager (OLI) and the thermal infrared sensor (TIRS), bringing new data and continuity to the Landsat program. The image produced by the OLI sensor is composed of nine spectral bands, of which eight bands have a spatial resolution of 30 m (coastal: 443 nm, blue: 485 nm, green: 563 nm, red: 655 nm, NIR: 865 nm, SWIR1: 1610 nm, SWIR2: 2200 nm and cirrus: 1375 nm). The system also provides a single, panchromatic band at a spatial resolution of 15 m. Only the first seven bands are used in our experiments. Table 2 shows the details of the nine images, including date acquired, the path and row and the percentage of cloud cover.The nine Landsat-8 images listed in Table 3 were downloaded from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Explorer web (https://glovis.usgs.gov/) as a standard Level-1 topographic corrected (LT1) product with the UTM/WGS84 projection. The nine images belong to two different seasons (leaf-off and growing). Each season, we should collect three images to cover the whole study area. We assume that there were no significant changes for the ground features during different periods of the same season.", 2. Materials, 2.2.1. Multi-Spectral Images,2
1189,"The Sentinel-1 mission, a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite, is comprised of two polar-orbiting satellites (1A, 1B) with a 6-day repeat cycle, operating day and night performing C-band synthetic aperture radar imaging, enabling the system to acquire imagery regardless of the weather. Sentinel-1A was successfully launched by ESA in April 2014, and Sentinel-1B was launched in April 2016. It supports operation in single-polarization (HH or VV) and dual-polarization (HH + HV or VV + VH); the products are available in three models (SM, IW and EW) suitable for Level-0, Level-1 and Level-2 processing. The SAR data for our research are shown in Table 3.As presented in Table 4, three Sentinel-1A IW Level-1 Single Look Complex (SLC) images, with a spatial resolution of 5 m by 20 m, were acquired on 22 and 27 August 2016 from the official website (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/).

1190,"The Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) is an international research effort that obtained digital elevation models on a near-global scale between 60° N and 56° S, with a specially modified radar system onboard the Space Shuttle Endeavour, collected during the 11-day STS-99 mission in February 2000. SRTM successfully gathered radar data for over 80% of the Earth’s surface with data points sampled at every one arc-second. The resulting Digital Elevation Model (DEM) was released under the name SRTM1 at a spatial resolution of 30 m; another version was released as SRTM3 at a 90-m resolution. These data are currently distributed free of charge by the USGS and available for downloading from the National Map Seamless Data Distribution System or the USGS FTP site. These data are provided in an effort to promote the use of geospatial science and applications for sustainable development and resource conservation. Five SRTM1 DEM images (n31e114, n30e115, n30e114, n30e113 and n29e114) covering our study area were acquired from the USGS Earth Explorer (http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), and used to extract topographic features, which can improve the results of forest type classification [11], especially when combined with spectral features [12,13].", 2.

1191,"To obtain reference data of pure and homogeneous stands of a forest type, a forest inventory map created in 2008 was used, which is a survey of forest resources and contains characteristics of dominant forest types, such as average height, Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), volume, age, canopy density, topographic factors and forest management type. The forest management type can be summarized as two types: one is commercial forest used for mainly developing economic benefit, and the other is ecological public welfare forest for green landscape and climate adjustment. In additional, most of the forest area in the study site is located in a biological reserve and belongs to the ecological public welfare forest, where the surface coverage is relatively difficult to change. The reference samples are manually outlined from the ecological public welfare forest type. Furthermore, in order to confirm whether the forestland type in the sample area has been changed, we also have a visual inspection of the high-resolution imagery of Google Earth in the same period. Thus, the used forest inventory data from 2008 have little negative influence on our results. The main forest types in the study area are four single-dominant forest types and four mixed forest types. Table 5 shows the details of the reference data (samples).As can be seen from Table 5, two lines labeled as forest and non-forest (in the second column) describe the samples used for forest and non-forest classification, while the other eight lines record the samples used for classifying eight forest types. Considering that the mixed forest types may occur at the boundary of the plot acquired from forest inventory data and geometric correction error, we used a size of 9 × 9 pixels at the center of the plots as training and validation data. For the four single-dominant forest types, each polygon consists of an individual forest type. In the case of the four mixed forest types, each polygon consists of a group of adjacent forest types. As illustrated in Figure 2, the selected reference data were well distributed throughout the study site, and the forest categories of samples are Pinus massoniana (PIMA), Cunninghamia lanceolata (CULA), Quercus acutissima (QUAC), Populus lasiocarpa (POLA), Sclerophyllous Broad-Leaved (SCBL), Soft Broad-Leaved (SOBL), Broad-Leaved (BRLE) and Coniferous (CONI).The reference data, shown in Figure 2, are manually outlined using the forest inventory map. In this study, we randomly and manually selected 3/4 of the sample data in each class evenly distributed in the study site as training data, while the rest for accuracy verification. The size of samples for each class varied from 25.11 ha–175.77 ha, and the size description of each class is listed in Table 5. The well-distributed samples and random selection strategy can be more robust and reliable for classification. Figure 3 shows the mean spectral reflectance of the eight forest types within the delineated reference polygons on images of Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8. It can be seen that the spectral values of different forest types in Landsat-8 imagery vary more than the Sentinel-2A data in the visible light bands, but opposite in the SWIR bands. In addition, the forest type discrimination ability of Sentinel-2A images is better than Landsat-8 in the red-edge and near-infrared bands. What is more, the spectral values of Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 imagery vary less in the visible light bands than the red-edge and near-infrared bands. Therefore, the red-edge and near-infrared bands are often regarded as the best bands to distinguish forest species. As expected, the spectral values of the broadleaf trees, such as POLA, SOBL, SCBL, BRLE and QUAC, are higher than the coniferous trees, such as CONI, CULA, and PIMA [36]. In addition, POLA has the highest spectral reflectance in the near-infrared band, while PIMA has the lowest in Figure 3a. SCBL has different spectral values in the near-infrared band. QUAC and BRLE are very similar in all seven bands in Figure 3b. However, the difference of spectral values between QUAC and BRLE is obvious in the near-infrared band of Sentinel-2A; thus, the configuration of Sentinel-2A and Landsat-8 images is conducive to forest type identification. The spectral reflectance of forest types gradually decreased in the red-edge and near-infrared bands and increased from late summer to high autumn in other bands [7,8]. Therefore, adding the phenology information can contribute to forest type identification.", 2. Materials, 2.2.4. Reference Data,2
1192,"For the multispectral Sentinel-2A (S2) images, we performed atmospheric corrections with the SNAP 5.0 and Sen2Cor 2.12 software provided by the ESA. Two large scene Sentinel-2A images were mosaicked and then clipped, using the boundary of the study area. In this study, the bands with 60-m spatial resolution were not used, and other remaining bands with a spatial resolution of 10 m and 20 m were resampled to 10 m based on the nearest neighbor algorithm [37]. The downloaded Landsat-8 images were processed by ENVI 5.3.1 as follows: we performed radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction by the FLAASH atmospheric model, and the cloud cover was removed using a cloud mask, built from the quality assessment band in the Landsat-8. We applied a mosaicking process to these images and a clipped operation with the boundary of the study area. Moreover, Landsat-8 images were co-registered to the Sentinel-2A images and resampled at the spatial resolution of the first seven bands to 10 m by [37].Sentinel-1A data were preprocessed in SARscape 5.2.1 using a frost filter to reduce the speckle noise. The backscatter values were radiometrically calibrated to eliminate terrain effects and georeferenced by converting the projection of the slant or ground distance to the geographic UTM/WGS84 coordinate system. To avoid the effects of small values, we transformed the result of calibration into a unit of dB as in:

DNdB = 10·log10(N)

where N is the per-pixel value calculated by geocoding and radiometric calibration. Sentinel-1A images were co-registered to the Sentinel-2A images and resampled to a 10-m resolution by [37], followed by a mosaicked process and clipped to the study area.For the five SRTM1 DEM images in our study, the mosaicking and clipping operations on these images were firstly performed, then all DEM images were co-registered to the Sentinel-2A images and resampled to 10-m spatial resolution by [37]. The slope and aspect features are derived from the clipped DEM. ", 3. Methods, 3.1. Data Preprocessing,3
1193,"Image classification is based on the analysis of image objects obtained by Multi-Resolution Segmentation (MRS), which is known as a bottom-up region-merging technique. These objects are generated by merging neighboring pixels or small segmented objects. The principle of merging is to ensure that the average heterogeneity between neighboring pixels or objects is the smallest and the homogeneity among the internal pixels of the object is the greatest [38]. Our image segmentation is performed with the eCognition Developer 8.7. Four key parameters are used to adjust MRS: scale, the weight of color and shape, the weight of compactness and smoothness and the weights of input layers. The scale parameter is used to determine the size of the final image object, which corresponds to the allowed maximum heterogeneity when generating image objects [39,40]. The larger the scale parameter, the larger the size of the generated object, and vice versa. Homogeneity is used to represent the minimum heterogeneity and consists of two parts, namely color (spectrum) and shape. The sum of the weights for the color and shape is 1.0. The weights of color and shape can be set according to the characteristics of land cover types in the images. The shape is composed of smoothness and compactness. The former refers to the degree of smoothness for the edge of the segmented object, and the later refers to the degree of closeness of the entire object. The sum of the weights for the smoothness and compactness is also 1.0. The weights of input layers are used to set the weight of the band to participate in the segmentation. We can set the weights of input layers according to the requirements of the application.In this study, the four 10-m resolution bands (Band 2, 3, 4, and 8) of Sentinel-2A were used as the MRS input layer to define objects, and a similar operation was applied to other images using the segmented boundary. An analysis of MRS was performed by different segmentation parameter sets, and visual assessment was done based on comparing the matching between the segmented objects and the reference polygons for the segmented results using the trial and error approach [17], selecting 30, 0.1 and 0.5, for the scale, shape and compactness parameters, respectively.

1194,"To handle a large number of input variables and the limited sample data, our classification in stages at Level-2 and Level-3 was accomplished by an object-based classification method: Random Forest (RF) [31]. RF is an integrated learning method based on a decision tree, which is combined with many ensemble regression or classification trees [29] and uses a bagging or bootstrap algorithm to build a large number of different training subsets [41,42]. Each decision tree gives a classification result for the samples not chosen as training samples. The decision tree “votes” for that class, and the final class is determined by the largest number of votes [24]. This approach can handle thousands of input variables without variable deletion and is not susceptible to over-fitting as the anti-noising ability is enhanced by randomization. The weight of the variables as feature importance can be estimated [42].To estimate the importance in forest construction, internal unbiased error estimation uses Out-Of-Bag (OOB) sampling, in which objects from the training set are left out of the bootstrap samples and not used to construct the decision trees. There are two ways to calculate variable importance: the Gini coefficient method and the permutation variable importance approach [31]. The former is based on the principle of impurity reduction, while the latter, selected in our RF analysis, is based on random selection and index reordering. The permutation variable importance method was carried out to measure variable important. First of all, the accuracy of prediction in the OOB observations are calculated after growing a tree, then the accuracy of prediction is computed after the association between the variable of interest, and the corresponding output is destroyed by permuting the values of all individuals for the variable of interest. The importance of the variable of interest from a single tree is calculated by subtraction of the two accuracy values. The final importance for the variable of interest is obtained by calculating the average value of all tree importance values in random forest. The same procedure is carried out for all other variables.In this study, the random forest approach including the estimation of OOB was programmed with OpenCV2.4.10. Three parameters must be set: the number of decision trees (NTree), the number of variables for each node (SubVar) and the maximum depth of a tree (MaxDepth). We set NTree to 20, MaxDepth to 6 and SubVar to one-quarter of the total number of input variables for all tested scenarios.", 3. Methods, 3.3. Object-Based Random Forest ,3
1195,"The forest type mapping was obtained through a hierarchical strategy, including vegetation classification at the first level, forestland extraction at the second layer and forest type classification at the third level. 3.4.1. Vegetation Classification at Level-1The first level of classification is to extract vegetation from land cover and contains two steps. The first step is vegetation and blue roof extraction using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) threshold analysis and then removal of blue roofs misclassified as vegetation by the Ratio Blue Index (RBI) threshold analysis. NDVI has been ubiquitously used for vegetation extraction in global land processes [43,44]. In this study, it was calculated from near-infrared and red bands using the 10-m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2A, written as:

 are the reflectance from the near-infrared and red bands, respectively.The NDVI threshold analysis is performed by the stepwise approximation method [20]. The principle of this method is first to fix an initial threshold in the NDVI histogram and then determine the optimal threshold when the image objects of vegetation are best matched by visual inspection. However, there exists an overlap in NDVI values between blue building roofs and vegetation, which means that some blue roofs can be misclassified as vegetation. Compared to the vegetation, the mean reflection value of the blue roof is higher in the visible light bands, while being lower in the near-infrared band [45]. To distinguish blue roofs and vegetation, a Ratio Blue Index (RBI) threshold analysis based on the stepwise approximation is further carried out, consistent with the process of vegetation extraction. RBI is the band ratio of the near-infrared to blue roofs, defined by:

 are the reflectance of the near-infrared and blue bands, respectively. In this study, we set the threshold of NDVI to 0.57 for non-vegetation removal, and RBI is 2.1 for blue roof removal, leading the pure vegetation to further classification at Level-2.  3.4.2. Forestland Classification at Level-2The second hierarchical (Level-2) classification is to extract forest and non-forest objects from the acquired vegetation at Level-1 using the RF approach. RF classification was carried out to evaluate the relative contributions of S2, S1, DEM and L8 on forestry land extraction by four experiments. To accomplish this process, texture features, spectral features and topographic features were firstly extracted from the segmented objects. The spectral features are comprised of land cover surface reflectance and vegetation indices acquired from the combination of visible and near-infrared spectral bands, as well as a simple, effective and empirical measure of surface vegetation conditions. Texture features are calculated by texture filters based on co-occurrence matrix. This matrix is a function of both the angular relationship and distance between two neighboring pixels and shows the number of occurrences of the relationship between a pixel and its specified neighbor [46,47]. These filters include mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, entropy, second moment and correlation. To reduce high dimensional and redundant texture features, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is carried out to achieve a more accurate classification result by [48]. As shown in Table 6, a total of 36 features derived from Sentinel-2A and DEM imagery was chosen to extract the forested areas, including 21 spectral features, 12 textural features and three topographic features.As presented in Table 6, the spectral features include the mean value of each band for Sentinel-2A and vegetation indices. In this study, we extract the texture features using the 10-m spatial resolution bands of the Sentinel-2A images (Sb2, Sb3, Sb4 and Sb8) and obtain three principal components based on PCA, which can explain 95.02% of our texture features. Topographic features are represented by a DEM, aspect and slope, and the features of aspect and slope are extracted from the DEM. RF begins with these 36 features acquired from the S2 and DEM imagery and outputs the forested areas as input for the Level-3 classification. 3.4.3. Forest Type Classification at Level-3The main object of Level-3 classification is to classify forested area into more detailed forest types, which are combined with the four single-dominant forests and the four mixed forest types, according to the actual distribution in our study area. Among these species, CONI can be more easily distinguished than the other three mixed forest types due to the significant spectral differences between them. For the type of coniferous (e.g., PIMA and CULA) or the mixed-broadleaf forest (e.g., QUAC and POLA), it is more difficult to identify these species from a single dataset due to the high similarity between spectrums. Therefore, other features such as topographic and phenology information must be collected to improve classification results. In this study, a multi-source dataset (S1, S2, DEM and L8) was obtained from four kinds of sensors. As shown in Table 7, the 59 features derived from these multi-source images, including 21 spectral features from S2, three topographic features derived from DEM, two backscattering features obtained from S1 and 33 spectral features from L8 time-series images, were used to find the best configuration for classifying eight forest types.As shown in Table 7, the 21 spectral features extracted from S2 images are consist with the average spectral values of each band and vegetation indexes, which are a combination of visible and near-infrared bands, like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Difference Vegetation Index (DVI). The three topographic features are DEM, aspect and slope; in particular, aspect and slope are calculated from the DEM. The two backscattering features (VV, VH) obtained from Sentinel-1A are also used in forest type mapping. The 33 spectral features derived from the multi-temporal L8 images are chosen to capture temporal information, indicating physiological growth and phonological changes. Forest type identification was accomplished by RF using the combination of these features, and the accuracy was significantly improved with the added temporal information from L8 imagery.", 3.

For the type of coniferous (e.g., PIMA and CULA) or the mixed-broadleaf forest (e.g., QUAC and POLA), it is more difficult to identify these species from a single dataset due to the high similarity between spectrums.

1199,"The forestland (Level-2 classification) was extracted based on RF by the best combination of Sentinel-2A and DEM images with an overall accuracy of 99.3% and a kappa coefficient of 0.99, respectively. As shown in Figure 5, the forest was colored with green, and non-forest was colored with black.The final mapping of the eight forest types is shown in Figure 6, and corresponded to the actual distribution of forest types [21,49].As can be seen from Figure 6, PIMA was the most abundant dominant forest type located on ridges and near the Mulanshan National Park, Wuhan. The proportion of CULA and QUAC was relatively small, concentrated in the east of the Mulanshan National Park. Woodland was found in the mountainous areas in the northern part of the study site, while the coniferous forests were the most ubiquitously distributed forest species, according to forest inventory data and reports from the website of the Forestry Department [34]. Furthermore, the QUAC stands were mainly distributed on the ridge and south-facing side of the slope, which was in line with the favorable habitat for QUAC. For POLA, although the amount was not large, it was scattered in the south and center parts of the study area, and more isolated than other forest types. The spatial distribution of heterogeneous mixed forest such as the SOBL and CONI forest types was more likely to be located on the low-elevation slopes and flat areas near communities. On the other hand, SCBL and BRLE had smaller areas compared to SOBL and CONI, concentrating in the lower altitude mountainous areas. The distribution of SOBL, POLA and SCBL seemed reasonable, and the accuracy of classification was much higher.However, there were still some biases from the mapping results, revealed by the visual inspection. The tree crowns classified as BRLE yielded lower classification accuracy because of some mixed broad-leaved forest in the northwest were, in reality, mixed stands with PIMA and CONI, while BRLE was more likely to be found around water bodies. This is consistent with mixed forest habitats, which there are more likely to grow in a place with cool and rich soil with shade. CULA was under-represented, and PIMA was overrepresented due to the similarity of spectral features. In addition, QUAC was underrepresented due to confusion with SCBL and PIMA, while the amount of CONI might have been a little high as some PIMA may have been misclassified as CONI. The overall accuracy of the mapping results of the forest types in the study area was approximately 82.12%, with the highest amount of PIMA and CONI, consistent with [34,35].

The features with higher weight were considered more relevant and important. We have evaluated and analyzed the feature weights to benefit from all features from the final forest type mapping. Figure 7 illustrates the feature importance of forest type identification with the highest accuracy, where the colored bars are the feature importance of the forest, along with their inter-tree variability. The higher the quantification value of a feature, the more important is the feature.Figure 7 displays the importance of 43 features (described in Table 6 in Section 3.4.3), which were selected by RF for forest type identification, including three topographic features, one backscattering feature (VV) and 39 spectral features. These features were acquired from the highest accuracy at the Level-3 classification using S1, S2, DEM and L8 images, and the importance of features was assessed by the substitution method of RF. The most pivotal feature was the slope, a topographic feature extracted from DEM, indicating that the feature of the slope contributed the most to forest type identification, especially in mountain areas. Phenological features (e.g., L8_July b2, L8_June b4, Sb11, L8_March b1, L8_March ndvi, L8_July b5, L8_July b4, L8_June dvi, Sb12, L8_July ndvi, L8_June rvi, L8_July rvi, L8_March b2) extracted from Landsat-8 in March, June and July and Sentinel-2A in late August and early September were the next most pivotal as these features representing phenology information obtained consistently higher quantization scores. Although the contribution of some features was relatively low, such as the backscattering features obtained from VV images of Sentinel-1A, they were still helpful in terms of improving the accuracy of classification. This is because the microwave from the Sentinel-1A penetrates into forests interacting with different parts of trees, producing big volume scattering. ", 4. Results, 4.2. Feature Importance of Forest Type Identification,4
1201,"Table 8 summarizes the results of four classification scenarios for forestland extraction, where the highest accuracy (99.30%) was achieved by the combined Sentinel-2A and DEM images.To classify eight types of forest further, seven classification scenarios were compared to obtain the most suitable combination of the multi-source dataset. The classification schemes are presented in Table 9, where the remote sensing imagery, the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient are listed for each tested scenario.The scenarios summarized in Table 9 indicate that the use of different image combinations can facilitate forest type identification. The overall accuracy of classification ranged from 50.00–82.78% with kappa coefficients between 0.38 and 0.78. As can been seen from Table 9, forest type identification using only Sentinel-2A imagery produces higher overall accuracies (54.31%, Scenario 1) than using only Landsat-8 data acquired in July (50.0%, Scenario 2). This is because there are three red-edge bands and two near-infrared bands for Sentinel-2A imagery, which are conducive to forest type identification based on the spectral feature curve in Figure 3. In addition, the spatial resolution of Landsat-8 imagery is lower than the Sentinel-2A imagery, and the larger pixels imply a greater spectral mixture of classes [50]. Therefore, in the following experiment, we used Sentinel-2A data as the basis, then gradually added the multi-temporal Landsat-8, DEM and Sentinel-1 imagery for a further comparative analysis. Compared with the forest type identification using only Sentinel-2A imagery (54.31%, Scenario 1), the overall accuracy was improved by about 15.23% when combining DEM and Sentinel-2A data (69.54%, Scenario 3). This result illustrated that the spatial distribution of different forest types is greatly affected by topographic information. Additionally, the overall accuracy was greatly improved by about 22.51% when combining multi-temporal Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery (76.82%, Scenario 7). Therefore, we concluded that phenology information is very important for forest type identification. In Scenario 4, we used the fused Sentinel-2A, DEM and multi-temporal Landsat-8 imagery to map forest types and obtained an overall accuracy of 80.13%. Moreover, the highest overall accuracy was obtained from Scenario 5 by the continuously added VH polarized images. However, the overall accuracy was not well improved when adding Sentinel-1 data in Scenario 6. We obtained the best combination of multi-source imagery from the Scenario 5, where the result illustrated that multi-source remotely sensed data have great potential for forest type identification by complementary advantages with spatial resolution, temporal resolution, spectral resolution and backscattering characteristics, leading to a more favorable recognition environment to identify forest types.A further accuracy assessment for the classification of Scenario 5 is summarized by a confusion matrix. A quarter of the reference data were chosen to validate the classification accuracy. These selected samples, with an average size of 9 × 9 pixels, were distributed among the actual forest types. Table 10 shows the detailed evaluation on the most suitable configuration of forest type mapping, including the user’s and producer’s accuracy, the overall accuracy and the kappa coefficient.From the assessment of the confusion matrix in Table 10, each of the four single-dominant species (PIMA, CULA, QUAC and POLA) and the four mixed forest species (SCBL, SOBL, BRLE and CONI) contained at least one misclassification. The producer accuracies of per-class varied from 50–96.30%, and the user accuracies ranged from 68.75–100%, respectively. In addition, CONI and POLA showed more than 80% producer’s and user’s accuracies, which means that we have obtained small omission and commission errors, achieving the best classification results. For the four mixed forest types, SOBL obtained the smallest producer accuracy (71.43%), and therefore, it represented the highest omission error among all the mixed forest types. SCBL, CONI and SOBL each have achieved more than 80% user’s accuracy, while BRLE obtained the smallest with 68.75%. CONI has obtained the highest producer’s accuracy of 93.75% in the four mixed forest types. For the four single-dominant species, the classification of PIMA and POLA resulted in a producer’s accuracy of more than 90%, representing a small omission error. However, for the CULA and QUAC, the producer’s accuracies were 58.33% and 50%, respectively. CULA, BRLE and SOBL were mistakenly classified as PIMA, and as a result, PIMA represented the smallest user accuracy (78.79%), followed by CULA with 87.50% accuracy. QUAC obtained the highest user accuracy of 100%, which demonstrated that there was no misclassification.Furthermore, we observed that the mixed forest types obtained the greatest confusion error compared to the single-dominant types, especially BRLE and CONI. For the four single-dominant species, misclassification between the same forest type (e.g., CULA and PIMA from conifers, POLA and QUAC from broadleaf) occurred at a higher rate than it did between different types, as conifers and broadleaf [51]. The bidirectional reflectance is not only related to the reflection characteristics of the land cover, but also to the radiation environment, which may explain why the PIMA class was misclassified as SCBL. Moreover, the changes in reflectance for the same land cover forest area, caused by the sun angle and slope at a different time, will bring some incorrect classification. Some forest types are highly heterogeneous in terms of landscape, and there is no obvious boundary between them. For example, both BRLE and SCBL are mixed forest types and difficult to identify during on-site acquisition, increasing the difficulty of classification. One of the most pivotal results of the confusion matrix from the highest accuracy in forest type identification was that a large number of zeros indicated that the proposed forest type identification method had achieved a great deal of success [52].", 4. Results, 4.3. Accuracy Assessment for Forest Types,4
1202,"This study demonstrates that freely-accessible multi-source imagery (Sentinel-1A, Sentinel-2A, DEM and multi-temporal Landsat-8) could significantly improve the overall accuracy of forest type identification by comparative analysis of multiple scenario experiments. We obtained a more accurate mapping result of forest type than the previous studies using Sentinel-2A or similar free satellite images. Immizer et al. [17] mapped forest types using Sentinel-2A data based on the object-oriented RF algorithm in Central Europe with an overall accuracy of 66.2%. Dorren et al. [13] combined Landsat TM and DEM images to identify forest types in the Montafon by an MLC classifier and obtained an overall accuracy of 73%. In addition, the number of identified forest types in this study, especially the mixed forest types, was more than previous studies [17,20]. Compared with the Landsat-8 imagery in Scenario 2, the overall accuracy can be improved by 4.31% when using only the Sentinel-2A imagery, which means that the Sentinel-2A imagery was more helpful to map forest types. The slop feature (Figure 7) derived from the DEM data contributed the most to classifying forest types, indicating that the spatial distribution of forest types is greatly influenced by topographic information. In addition, the Sentinel-1A images also have a contribution to the classification accuracy with an approximately 2.65% improvement (Scenario 5 in Table 9).Regarding the employed multi-source imagery, these data consistently improved the overall accuracy of forest type identification. The time-series Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A data, covering the crucial growing and leaf-off seasons of the forest, could provide phenological information to improve the discrimination between different forest types. This result is in good agreement with the findings of [19,50], who summarized that time-series images can obtain much higher accuracy of mapping tropical forest types. Macander et al. [53] have also used seasonal composite Landsat imagery and the random forest method for plant type cover mapping and found that multi-temporal imagery improved cover classification. Topographic information derived from the DEM can better offer different geomorphologic characteristics. These characteristics reflect the habitats of different forest types and can help to identify forest types, similar to the studies established by [13,50]. Seen from the experimental results of forest type identification by using only Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2A imagery, we concluded that Sentinel-2A images can achieve a higher overall accuracy due to its high spatial resolution (Table 9 and Table 10). This result is the same as [50], who concluded that the classification using Sentinel-2 images performed better than Landsat-8 data.Regarding the strategy of hierarchical classification based on object-oriented RF, it can better and more flexibly combine data from multiple sources and simplify the complex classification problem into a number of simpler classifications. Zhu et al. [19] successfully mapped forest types based on two-level hierarchical classification using dense seasonal Landsat time-series images in Vinton County, Ohio. In our study, three-level hierarchical classification was carried out to map forest types. First, we extracted vegetation from land-cover utilizing two threshold analyses based on NDVI and RBI. Owing to RVI threshold analysis, we can well remove blue roofs misclassified as vegetation; because RVI improves the discrimination between forest types based on the different spectral characteristics in blue and near-infrared bands. For the second-level classification, Sentinel-2A and DEM images are enough to identify forestland and non-forest land. In the third-level classification, we fused information from images of DEM, time-series L8, S2 and S1 to better use the forest type structure habits and phenology. If we do not use hierarchical classification, combining all multi-source data to identify all classes will be time consuming. In addition, we can tune the parameters of RF separately to obtain optimal results from each classification level using the strategy of hierarchical classification. For the hierarchical approach, the RF classifier can assess the importance of features for the class of interest rather than all classes.Regarding the classification algorithm and classifier performance, it was observed that the object-based Random Forest (RF) method was incredibly helpful to identify forest types in our tested scenarios. In the process of hierarchical classification, RF uses a subset of features to build each individual hierarchy, making a more accurate classification decision based on effective features and reducing the error associated with the structural risk of the entire feature vector. Novack et al. [54] showed that RF classifier can evaluate each attribute internally; thus, it is less sensitive to the increase of variables (Table 5 and Table 6). The object-based classifier can provide faster and better results and can be easily applied to classify forest types [24,39,40,55]. In addition, this classification method has the ability to handle predictor variables with a multimodal distribution well due to the high variability in time and space [50,56]; especially, no sophisticated parameter tuning is required. Thus, it could obtain a higher overall accuracy.Regarding the feature importance for the highest accuracy of forest type classification (Figure 7), the input features were evaluated by the substitution method [33], and the feature distribution from the highest classification accuracy of forest types is consistent with some previous studies [51,57,58]. The slope and phenological features with higher quantization scores were the two most pivotal features for forest type identification. The classification accuracy listed in Table 8 was significantly improved by combining phenology information from multi-temporal L8 images and Sentinel-2A imagery, and the overall accuracy was raised at least 22.51% (Scenario 7); this result is in line with the research of [18,53], who reported that the multi-temporal imagery was more effective for plant type cover identification. The feature vegetation index in the bands of red and near-infrared from the Sentinel-2A also contributes to forest type classification, and other features abstracted from Sentinel-2A, DEM and multi-temporal Landsat-8 images (e.g., L8_June b6, L8_March b4, etc.) are listed as important. The removal of any feature can lead to a reduction in the overall accuracy, emphasizing the importance of topographic and phenology information for forest type identification. In addition, the backscattering features obtained from VV images of Sentinel-1A had a nearly 2.65% improvement for forest type classification between Scenario 4 and 5 (Table 8), which demonstrates that VV polarization radar images can help to improve classification accuracy, while using VV and VH features from Sentinel-1 data in Scenario 6 (Table 8) was less successful as the overall accuracy decreased by 1.32% compared to Scenario 5, which means that VV polarization imagery was found to better discriminate forest types than VH polarization data. The quantitative scores of features described in Figure 7 indicate that the 43 features extracted from the multi-source remote sensing data can be applied to map the forest types.This study suggests that freely-available multiple-source remotely-sensed data have the potential of forest type identification and offer a new choice to support monitoring and management of forest ecological resources without the need for commercial satellite imagery. Experimental results for eight forest types show that the proposed method achieves high classification accuracy. However, there still was misclassification between the forest types with similar spectral characteristics during a phonological period. As can be seen from the assessment report in Table 9, the incorrect classification between BRLE and PIMA, CULA and PIMA was always caused by the exceedingly high spectral similarity, especially in the old growth forests where shadowing, tree health and bidirectional reflectance exist [51,59]. Hence, some future improvements will include obtaining more accurate phenological information from Sentinel-2 and using 3D data like the free laser scanning data [60,61,62,63]. In general, the proposed method has the potential for mapping forest types due to the zero cost of all required remotely-sensed data.", 5. Discussion,None,5
1203,"In this study, we used freely-accessible multi-source remotely-sensed images to classify eight forest types in Wuhan, China. A hierarchical classification approach based on the object-oriented RF algorithm was conducted to identify forest types using the Sentinel-1A, Sentinel-2A, DEM and multi-temporal Landsat-8 images. The eight forest types are four single-dominant forest (PIMA, CULA, QUAC and POLA) and four mixed forest types (SCBL, SOBL, BRLE and CONI), and the samples of forest types were manually delineated using forest inventory data. To improve the discrimination between different forest types, phenological information and topographic information were used in the hierarchical classification. The final forest type map was obtained through a hierarchical strategy and achieved an overall accuracy of 82.78%, demonstrating that the configuration of multiple sources of remotely-sensed data has the potential to map forest types at regional or global scales.Although the spatial resolution of the multispectral images is not exceedingly high, the increased spectral resolution can make up for the deficiency of the spatial resolution, especially for Sentinel-2A images. The most satisfying results obtained from the combination of multi-source images are comparable to previous studies using high-spatial resolution images [64,65]. These free multiple-source remotely-sensed images (Sentinel-2A, DEM, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A) provide a feasible alternative to forest type identification. Given the limited availability of Sentinel-2A data for this study, the multi-temporal Landsat-8 data were used to extract phenology information. In the future, the two twin Sentinel-2 satellites will provide free and dense time-series images with a five-day global revisit cycle, which offers the greatest potential for further improvement in the forest type identification. In general, the configuration of Sentinel-2A, DEM, Landsat-8 and Sentinel-1A has the potential to identify forest types on a regional or global scale.", 6. Conclusions,None,6
1204,"Since the first REDD-style project (the Noel Kempff Mercado Climate Action Project) initiated in 1997, the focus of REDD+ has broadened from the avoidance of deforestation as the “single largest opportunity for cost-effective and immediate reductions of carbon emissions” [1] to a holistic concept for sustainable development. Protecting biodiversity, enhancing local livelihoods, strengthening local people’s rights, and improving forest governance are some of the widely discussed co-benefits that are embedded in REDD+ activities. However, the primary focus of REDD+ remains the reduction of carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation. For countries adopting a REDD+-regime, the most significant asset is to receive financial rewards for reducing emissions and enhancing carbon sinks. Results-based payments—also known as “carbon benefits”—constitute a key element that distinguishes REDD+ from other initiatives [2]. To generate payments, for any national or sub-national REDD+ initiative, the associated emission reductions have to be assessed. This includes the assessment of both changes of forest area (activity data) and changes of forest carbon stocks (emission factors). Activity data and emission factors have to be estimated by countries participating in REDD+ through the implementation of reliable measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) systems [3,4].MRV systems have to be implemented in a challenging environment of reliable estimates on the one hand and of adequate assessment costs on the other. The reliability of any MRV system is driven by the quality of remotely sensed data, the intensity of in-situ assessments (i.e., sample size) and the soundness of models utilized, and is, thus, directly linked to cost. Consequently, increasing reliability is necessarily associated with increasing cost. Thus, the development and implementation of any MRV system can be considered as an optimization problem: which MRV-design results in the highest level of reliability for a given cost, or in the lowest cost for a desired level of reliability.The Warsaw framework for REDD+ requires a country to implement a combined assessment approach that utilizes remote sensing data and in-situ assessments [4]. Associating field data and remote sensing provides an efficient solution to monitor the state and changes of forest carbon stocks [5,6]. Remote sensing of forest biomass involves different sensor types (e.g., Lidar, optical and radar), platforms (air- and space-borne), and processing techniques (e.g., unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid classification approaches) which substantially differ with respect to costs and performances. Even though these techniques gradually become more accessible, their implementation is still not viable, especially in vast tropical forest areas, due to poor investments in capacity building [7]. Overall, countries participating in REDD+ are developing their forest monitoring capacities, however, national forest inventories still need to be further improved [7,8]. The critical lack of funding in the REDD+ system restricts the possibilities to build capacities and to utilize high-resolution remote sensing sensors [9]. Although monitoring costs may be relatively small with respect to other categories of costs, they directly affect the success of REDD+ mechanisms; an effective monitoring system will reduce uncertainties and, as a result, eventually generate larger results-based payments [10]. From this perspective, a country may consider REDD+ as an investment providing long-term benefits and that will produce returns, and thus, exploit the opportunity that would allow a country to establish a monitoring system. Investing in sound, recurrent MRV systems critically determines a country’s potential to generate results-based payments. Moreover, such investments can support forest policies reforms and promote sustainable forest management. REDD+ can be an opportunity for tropical countries to establish a better forest-related institutional framework and to improve management of forests at different levels [11,12].Besides uncertainties in carbon estimates, other variables affect the amount of accountable carbon credits. A decisive role is played by the reference levels (RLs) and the planned reduction of business-as-usual emissions as a result of REDD+ activities. The reduction of past emissions rates results from the implementation on the ground of the five REDD+ mitigation actions (reduction of emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, conservation of forest carbon stocks, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks). A country should establish a target of emissions reduction according to its capacity to plan and execute the REDD+ activities and to the national RL [3]. The reduction of emissions actually determines the real removal of CO2 from the atmosphere; however, payments depend on the generation of measurable, monitored, and verified tons of CO2 emissions and removals.The RLs, which are used as business-as-usual baselines, benchmark the quantity of emission reductions and removals–due to REDD+ activities–that can be estimated to evaluate progress of countries participating in REDD+. Therefore, the quantity of avoided emissions against the agreed RL stipulates the total amount of accountable carbon credits. Establishing reliable RLs (used throughout this paper as synonym for “REDD baselines”) is crucial and challenging. Commonly used methods for establishing RLs include:
historical rates of deforestation, degradation and emission factors, also using adjustment factors to allow inclusion of social and economic variables (named “national circumstances”) [13], andprojected deforestation and forest degradation rates using land-use-change models [14,15].The debate on the implications of different methods is intense; the common view is that the selected RL method shapes the success of REDD+ and it should be selected according to the local circumstances, e.g., specific capabilities and data availability [16,17].This paper analyzes the links between financial resources invested in MRV systems, the achievable reliability and the resulting amount of accountable carbon credits. Furthermore, in a simulation study, we investigated implications of different (i) reference levels, (ii) emission reductions due to REDD+ and (iii) uncertainties in emissions estimates, on the generation of carbon credits and the consequent potential financial benefits from alternative MRV systems. In addition, we studied investments in Lidar-based monitoring systems as a cost-efficient option for REDD+ projects. 1.1. State of the Art 1.1.1. Model-Assisted Design-Based AGB Estimation Using Remote SensingIntegrating ground-based observations with remotely sensed data is the most cost-efficient way to monitor the national state of forests [5]. Remotely sensed data–calibrated over field measurements—contribute to improve precision and to provide spatially explicit information [18]. When remote sensing data are used as auxiliary information, and are incorporated in a design-based framework by using a model, the resulting approach is called design-based model-assisted, or simply model-assisted approach [19]. In model-assisted approaches, auxiliary data from remote sensing are incorporated in the estimation process through regression models; this reduces the design variance of the field sample-based estimator of the population’s total aboveground biomass (AGB). When auxiliary data are highly correlated with AGB, the cost-efficiency of the estimation could be improved [6]. Particularly, for large-scale monitoring activities (e.g., at national and sub-national levels), the combined approach (i.e., remote sensing and field measurements) reduces costs while ensuring accuracy and reliability [20]. Optical sensors, Radar, and Lidar remote sensing techniques are the main sources of remotely sensed data used to extract information for forest biomass [21,22]. Depending on circumstances and needs, one sensor type can be more suitable than another: there is no “one-sensor-fits-all” approach [23]. However, Lidar performance is significantly better than passive optical or Radar sensor used alone [21]. The coefficient of determination, R2, provides a measure of (linear) regression performance, indicating the amount of variance explained by the model, and expressing the correlation between the auxiliary variable(s) and the variable(s) of interest. Therefore, the R2 is also a measure of the contribution of remotely sensed data to forest biomass estimation, i.e., it is related to the reduction of standard error achievable by linking remotely sensed data to pure in-situ based estimation. A higher R2 value means better precision of biomass estimation. 1.1.2. Cost-Efficiency of Lidar-Based MethodsIt is widely accepted that a combined Lidar and field-campaign approach provides precise estimates of AGB. However, the actual cost-effectiveness of such an approach is still intensively discussed. Due to its substantial cost, Lidar is still considered a hard alternative for large-scale forest monitoring in most tropical countries [24]. The application for large-scale assessments at successive occasions in tropical regions is apparently still far from being operational, and many countries may see the associated cost as a major obstacle for a routine application. However, only few studies have analyzed the actual trade-offs between efficiency and costs associated with the use of Lidar in carbon estimation [25,26]. There is uncertainty whether large investment in monitoring activities will result in higher returns through REDD+ results-based payments. Assessing the cost-effectiveness of model-assisted estimation of AGB using alternative remotely sensed data as auxiliary data will help to understand the actual feasibility and the major constraints for the design and implementation of targeted MRV systems. 1.1.3. Addressing Uncertainties in REDD+: the Reliable Minimum EstimateQuantifying uncertainties is of primary importance in the context of REDD+. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) suggests the use of the reliable minimum estimate (RME) to quantify uncertainties in the estimates of emission factors and activity data [27]. Adopting the principle of conservativeness in REDD+ estimates was proposed by Grassi et al. [28] in order to “address the potential incompleteness and high uncertainties of REDD estimates, and thus to increase their credibility”. The RME reduces the risk of overestimating the emissions reduction derived by a REDD+ project, which could lead to an overcompensation of emission reduction. The RME is defined as the difference between the lower limit of the confidence interval at the reference period (time 1) and the upper limit of the confidence interval at the commitment period (time 2) (Figure 1). The RME is the minimum quantity to be expected with a given probability and is a conservative way to handle uncertainties, related to all error types (e.g., sampling errors, measurement errors and modeling errors). While on the one hand the RME supports the credibility of estimates, its efficacious application depends on several factors, such as baseline emissions and the method used to set such baselines [29,30].", 1.

1205,"Two main sources of data were used: (i) forest inventory data from Puerto Rico and (ii) qualitative and quantitative data on the use of Lidar and passive optical sensors for biomass estimation extracted from peer-reviewed articles (Table S1). 2.1.1. Field DataThe field plot data were collected during the third forest inventory of Puerto Rico [31,32]. The forested life zones in Puerto Rico are classified as subtropical dry, subtropical moist, subtropical wet and rain, subtropical lower montane wet, and subtropical lower montane rain. Totally 956 plots were sampled in the whole country, of which 288 were located within forested areas. In this study, we only considered plots located in moist forests and in wet and rain forests, which were 141 and 82, respectively (Table 1). These two forested life zones would be the most suitable target areas for local REDD+ projects, as they are the most important in terms of area covered and carbon content. The permanent sampling unit installed is a cluster of four subplots, within which all trees with DBH ≥ 2.5 cm were measured [31]. Each subplot has a radius of 7.3 m, resulting in a sample plot area of 0.067 ha. We did not carry out any biomass and carbon assessment for each individual tree. For the simulations, we utilized aggregated plot level information, as reported in the forest inventory. Accordingly, the sample mean of the aboveground biomass (Equation (1)), the sample variance (Equation (2)), and the relative standard error (Equation (3)) were estimated as follows:

.No Lidar flight was conducted for the purpose of this study. We surveyed twenty refereed papers that used AGB estimation with Lidar sensors in tropical and subtropical rainforest biomes. We did not aim to provide a comprehensive review of Lidar applications in tropical forests; rather we collected sufficient information to provide our analysis with realistic and reliable estimates. For each paper we recorded, inter alia, the coefficient of determination (R2), and used it to evaluate the contribution of remote sensing techniques to forest AGB and carbon densities prediction. The surveyed papers are listed in Table S1. The R2 values for the reviewed studies range from 0.54 to 0.94, with an approximate mean of 0.8 and standard deviation of 0.11 [33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51]. This means that Lidar-based auxiliary variables correlate well with the field-based data. Firstly, we estimated the aboveground carbon stock based on field measurements alone and the variance (as in Equation (2)); secondly, we simulated the potential improvement in precision gained by using Lidar, assuming an R2 of 0.8 by applying Equation (5). 2.1.3. Cost of Carbon MonitoringTrying to approximate the exact cost of Lidar is a difficult task: it varies according to several factors. Moreover, most studies do not report costs in forestry applications. Lidar acquisition cost mainly depends on the type of platform used, area coverage and pulse density (also called pulses, points, returns, and echoes) [52]. Flight speed determines pulse density, which affects the accuracy of the forest structure metrics detected. Therefore, pulse density—i.e., speed and time of the flight—and accuracy are tightly related. The relationship between these two is not linear: they increase constantly, and beyond a certain pulse density level, accuracy remains nearly the same [52,53]. Published studies have demonstrated that a relatively modest reduction of laser pulse density had no effect on the precision of stem volume estimates [54,55]. Also in tropical areas, studies using pulse densities varying from 25 pulses/m2 [40] to approximately 1.5 pulses/m2 [20] reached similar results in terms of biomass prediction performance; however, several other factors can affect prediction performance, e.g., forest structure, terrain morphology, and models used. Overall, high pulse densities may not be necessary for estimation of forest biomass. Thus, relatively low-cost Lidar-data acquisition campaigns can lead to acceptable levels of accuracy for carbon stock estimates, and adopting low-pulse-density airborne laser scanner data for estimation of forest attributes at stand level could be cost efficient in forest inventorying [56]. Finally, a great impact on per unit area cost is attributable to economies of scales: the per-hectare costs decrease as the spatial extent of the flight increases.We collected cost estimates from five studies and established accordingly two sets of costs to use in our study (Table 2). To show the effect of costs on aboveground carbon density monitoring in REDD+ context, we considered two plausible alternative costs of monitoring. In the first alternative, we assumed a smaller area inventory, typical for a REDD+ project. As this scenario implies higher costs per unit area, we selected expenses of $5000 ha−1 for field-based sampling and $8 ha−1 for Lidar. In the second scenario we assume a large forested area as in regional or national REDD+ monitoring; in this case, considering the associated benefits from economies of scale, the per hectare costs are set to $500 and $0.5 ha−1, for field-based sampling and Lidar, respectively.", 2.

The permanent sampling unit installed is a cluster of four subplots, within which all trees with DBH ≥ 2.5 cm were measured [31]. Each subplot has a radius of 7.3 m, resulting in a sample plot area of 0.067 ha. We did not carry out any biomass and carbon assessment for each individual tree. For the simulations, we utilized aggregated plot level information, as reported in the forest inventory. Accordingly, the sample mean of the aboveground biomass (Equation (1)), the sample variance (Equation (2)), and the relative standard error (Equation (3)) were estimated as follows:

.No Lidar flight was conducted for the purpose of this study. We surveyed twenty refereed papers that used AGB estimation with Lidar sensors in tropical and subtropical rainforest biomes. We did not aim to provide a comprehensive review of Lidar applications in tropical forests; rather we collected sufficient information to provide our analysis with realistic and reliable estimates. For each paper we recorded, inter alia, the coefficient of determination (R2), and used it to evaluate the contribution of remote sensing techniques to forest AGB and carbon densities prediction. The surveyed papers are listed in Table S1. The R2 values for the reviewed studies range from 0.54 to 0.94, with an approximate mean of 0.8 and standard deviation of 0.11 [33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50,51]. This means that Lidar-based auxiliary variables correlate well with the field-based data. Firstly, we estimated the aboveground carbon stock based on field measurements alone and the variance (as in Equation (2)); secondly, we simulated the potential improvement in precision gained by using Lidar, assuming an R2 of 0.8 by applying Equation (5).", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1.2. Lidar Data Extraction,2
1208,"Trying to approximate the exact cost of Lidar is a difficult task: it varies according to several factors. Moreover, most studies do not report costs in forestry applications. Lidar acquisition cost mainly depends on the type of platform used, area coverage and pulse density (also called pulses, points, returns, and echoes) [52]. Flight speed determines pulse density, which affects the accuracy of the forest structure metrics detected. Therefore, pulse density—i.e., speed and time of the flight—and accuracy are tightly related. The relationship between these two is not linear: they increase constantly, and beyond a certain pulse density level, accuracy remains nearly the same [52,53]. Published studies have demonstrated that a relatively modest reduction of laser pulse density had no effect on the precision of stem volume estimates [54,55]. Also in tropical areas, studies using pulse densities varying from 25 pulses/m2 [40] to approximately 1.5 pulses/m2 [20] reached similar results in terms of biomass prediction performance; however, several other factors can affect prediction performance, e.g., forest structure, terrain morphology, and models used. Overall, high pulse densities may not be necessary for estimation of forest biomass. Thus, relatively low-cost Lidar-data acquisition campaigns can lead to acceptable levels of accuracy for carbon stock estimates, and adopting low-pulse-density airborne laser scanner data for estimation of forest attributes at stand level could be cost efficient in forest inventorying [56]. Finally, a great impact on per unit area cost is attributable to economies of scales: the per-hectare costs decrease as the spatial extent of the flight increases.We collected cost estimates from five studies and established accordingly two sets of costs to use in our study (Table 2). To show the effect of costs on aboveground carbon density monitoring in REDD+ context, we considered two plausible alternative costs of monitoring. In the first alternative, we assumed a smaller area inventory, typical for a REDD+ project. As this scenario implies higher costs per unit area, we selected expenses of $5000 ha−1 for field-based sampling and $8 ha−1 for Lidar. In the second scenario we assume a large forested area as in regional or national REDD+ monitoring; in this case, considering the associated benefits from economies of scale, the per hectare costs are set to $500 and $0.5 ha−1, for field-based sampling and Lidar, respectively.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.1.3. Cost of Carbon Monitoring,2
1209,"We tested the adoption of two different approaches for MRV: the first approach assumes the use of Lidar data and the adoption of a model-assisted technique; the second approach utilizes stratified sampling with passive optical data. We evaluated costs-error implications of both approaches in accounting avoided emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in a REDD+ context under several potential scenarios. This resulted in three main methodological approaches and associated research questions:
(1)We created a series of subsamples from the 223 plots via bootstrapping. We simulated sampling with replacement for each sample size with 1000 iterations, starting from a sample size of 20 plots and increasing the size by one unit at a time, up to 223 plots. This resulted in a total of 204 different sample sizes and 204,000 iterations. Subsequently, the variance and the relative standard error of the estimate of aboveground carbon density (i.e., 


y
^


 in Equation (1)) were calculated for each iteration. Finally, the relationship between the relative standard error and the number of field plots was assessed.(2)We investigated, by a scenario approach, how uncertainties expressed by the relative standard error obtained in step 1 determine the accountable avoided emissions. Each scenario is characterized by a different combination of (i) the accuracy of carbon monitoring (expressed by the relative standard error), (ii) the baseline carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (i.e., RLs), and (iii) target for emission reductions as a result of REDD+ activities. The errors associated with the estimation of carbon stock changes were linked to the potential generation of carbon credits. Table 3 presents details of the scenarios implemented.(3)Finally, the results of steps 1 and 2 were combined with a set of realistic monitoring costs. For the alternative monitoring systems, as presented in step 2, different levels of uncertainty and cost frameworks were realized and the achievable amounts of accountable avoided emissions calculated. This allows to study the cost-efficiency of alternative MRV-designs.The above-described three steps were considered for two alternative monitoring approaches: (i) model-assisted estimation with Lidar remote sensing and (ii) stratified sampling with passive optical remote sensing. For each approach, the effect on the accountable generation of carbon credits was studied. In the model-assisted simulation, we assumed the availability of an error-free land-cover map, which allowed stratifying total land area in forest and non-forest. The estimate of the area of a certain forest type was based on the proportional number of sample plots located on that forest type. We simulated the integration of the field data and Lidar data through a model-assisted regression estimator, assuming an r2 of 0.8. Lidar strips were assumed to be the same extension of the field plots. In the simulation of stratified sampling, we assumed a combination of field assessments and remotely sensed optical data, which were assumed to be available wall-to-wall, providing auxiliary information for stratification. The alternatives are in line with Dec 14/CP 15 [63], as they utilize a combination of remote sensing for activity data and in-situ assessments for emission factors. The effect of the inclusion of different types of passive optical data on the accountable avoided emissions was evaluated considering two levels of classification errors: 3% and 20%. For combining uncorrelated uncertainties in area change and in carbon stock deriving from classification and sampling error, respectively, Equation (6) was used [64]:

1210,"Using results from the simulation study, the three variables affecting the avoided emissions were ranked according to their impact on the generation of carbon credits. In the sensitivity analysis, the “net avoided emission” is our variable of interest—i.e., the dependent variable—and is included as a function of three independent variables: standard error, RL, and target for emission reductions as a result of REDD+ activities. To describe and quantitatively assess the relationships between independent and dependent variables, we performed the Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient [65] using the sensitivity package of R, version 3.2.1 [66]. The Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient is based on regression analysis and measures the strength of the correlation between an input and an output variable, after removing any effect due to correlation of the other input variables. It ranges from −1 to 1, where −1 indicates a strong negative, 1 a strong positive, and 0 no correlation.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3. Sensitivity Analysis,2
1211,"The forest biomass carbon stock estimated from the 223 sample field-plots in the Puerto Rico forest dataset is 66.54 tons C ha−1. We used this amount as reference measure to conduct the analysis. Relative standard errors of carbon density estimates decrease with increasing sample size. The relative standard error achievable with the model-assisted method and with the stratified sampling and passive remote sensing ranges from 1.5% to 4% and from 7% to 28%, respectively. The introduction of auxiliary data correlated with the response variable (r2 = 0.8) in a model-assisted estimation significantly reduces the relative standard error (Figure 2). Combining the set of values assigned to the three variables that affect the generation of carbon credits (Table 3), 468 scenarios—i.e., possible permutations–were derived. However, only 52 out of 468 possible permutations had positive net avoided emissions at time 2 using the RME—i.e., generated carbon credits at the commitment period. It means that for the remaining 416 scenarios, the accountable emissions reduction produced by a REDD+ regime is smaller than or equal to the business-as-usual emission; therefore, they do not generate any carbon credit.Figure 3 compares the relative standard error versus the accountable emissions reduction using Lidar data (Figure 3a) and passive optical data (Figure 3b,c). Results in Figure 3 are reported per hectare as this is the commonly adopted reference area used by scientists, field managers, and land-management professionals for carbon assessments [67]. The amounts of avoided emissions under a REDD+ scheme—which can be converted into accountable carbon credits—vary according to the MRV system adopted. Differences between Figure 3a–c demonstrate the effect of incorporating optical and Lidar-based auxiliary data in AGB estimation: the low relative standard error achieved under a model-assisted approach (Figure 3a) allows generating larger amounts of accountable avoided emissions. For example, under a model-assisted approach, credits can be generated even if the baseline emission rate is relatively low (e.g., 3%); conversely, using passive remote sensing, the minimum emission rate that would allow carbon credits generation is 20% (Figure 3b).Larger amounts of credits are generated for larger quantities of baseline emission rates and emission reductions. Common to all scenarios is that when the baseline emission rate is 1% no carbon credit is generated (for that reason it is not displayed either in Figure 3 and Figure 4). For low RLs (e.g., <10%), the accountable avoided emissions slightly vary as a function of emissions reduction. However, as the baseline emission rate increases, the accountable avoided emissions vary to a larger extent as emissions reduction change. This, concurring with findings from the sensitivity analysis (see last paragraph of Section 3), this demonstrates that the emission reduction has a relatively minor impact on the generation of carbon credits, particularly when the baseline emission rates are low.While Figure 3 shows per-hectare estimates, Figure 4 shows results for forested life zones considered in the study, i.e., Puerto Rico’s moist forests, and wet and rain forests. Figure 4, which displays only the results of the model-assisted simulation, compares the cost of carbon monitoring and the accountable emission reductions generated for the respective costs. We did not include the simulation of stratified sampling with optical data in the analysis comparing monitoring costs and total avoided emissions, since there is no generation of carbon credits under such an approach, unless the classification error is 3% and the emission rate is above 20%. In fact, the simulation of stratified sampling with optical data that assumes a low classification error (3%) facilitates the generation of carbon credits only for emission rates above 20% (Figure 3b), while, under high classification error (i.e., 20%) (Figure 3c) no carbon credits would be generated in any of the assumed circumstances.Figure 4 indicates that large amounts of avoided emissions are reached in all scenarios even with relatively low monitoring costs, i.e., when the monitoring costs are about $20,000 and $200,000, for low- and high-monitoring cost, respectively. The latter costs can be considered a turning point: beyond that, the avoided emissions do not increase significantly. For example, when the emission rate is 8% and the emissions reduction 50% (green line in the top right graph of Figure 4a), about 560 k tC can be accounted with an approximate cost of $225,000; considering the same circumstance, increasing the costs by 80% would only increase the accountable carbon by 25%. This trend is common to all the considered scenarios. It suggests that beyond that turning point, greater investment in monitoring activities produces a minor reduction of the uncertainties, which does not result in an efficient generation of carbon credits.In order to evaluate the viability of an MRV system as an effective investment, we calculated a fictive carbon-market price for a single ton of carbon that is needed to pay off at least the MRV costs (Table 4). We divided the total estimated cost of monitoring activities of the Puerto Rico’s forest biomes considered in this study by the number of accountable avoided emissions (in tons of carbon) generated in any scenario. It allowed us to estimate the cost spent to monitor each ton of carbon and thus determine under which settings an MRV-system would be a useful investment. If the market price for a ton of carbon is higher than the costs reported in the fourth and fifth column, an MRV system would qualify as a useful investment for the given alternatives.The sensitivity analysis allowed assessing the sensitivity of carbon credits generation with respect to factors’ variation. The generation of carbon credits mostly varies as a function of errors. It confirms that the reduction of the standard error provides a decisive contribution in generating carbon credits; the RL has also a significant impact on the final avoided emissions. It is important to note that the amount of emissions reduction is the element with the smallest impact on the outcome.", 3. Results,None,3
1212,"Based on field plot data, derived from the third forest inventory of Puerto Rico, we made a set of realistic assumptions to investigate the relationships between emission reductions under a REDD+ regime and some variables affecting such emission reductions. Setting reference levels (RLs), supplying emission reduction from avoided deforestation and degradation, and implementing an efficient monitoring system underlie effective REDD+ projects, because these factors determine the accountable emission reductions, and thus the carbon credits generation. We ranked these factors by conducting a sensitivity analysis and found that uncertainties in forest monitoring represent the factor that mainly affects carbon credits generation. Findings highlight the fundamental role of Lidar sensors in forest carbon monitoring, particularly in REDD+; combining statistical features of forest sampling with Lidar data enables a significant generation of carbon credits. Investing in MRV systems based on statistically-sound sampling designs, with quantifiable precision, and remote-sensing techniques contributes to reduce uncertainties and to increase the amount of accountable carbon credits that can be claimed.Uncertainties in carbon estimates represent the factor that mainly affects the quantification of accountable emissions reduction and, therefore, can undermine the derived flow of benefits, such as the results-based payments to developing countries for avoiding deforestation [29,68]. The reduced uncertainties shown in the model-assisted simulation point out the potential contribution that Lidar data can give to REDD+ initiatives. Combining space- or air-borne imagery and field assessments offers an efficient way to monitor and map carbon stock, especially if large areas are considered [69,70]. This combination can have a twofold implication on REDD+ efficiency: for its lower costs of implementation–particularly in large-scale projects–and for the reduced uncertainties, which have a positive effect on the generation of measurable tons of reductions in CO2 emissions. However, the efficiency and success of a national monitoring program rely on many elements, which can be grouped in four general areas of investigation: (i) measurement techniques and data collection; (ii) data compilation, analysis and processing; (iii) remote sensing techniques; and (iv) information management techniques [71]. Therefore, planning statistically rigorous sampling designs aimed at supporting field-measurement campaigns integrated with remote sensing data, is fundamental in forest inventory, as well as in MRV.Even though we applied a conservative approach to estimate uncertainties of carbon stock change, monitoring avoided emissions through a model-assisted technique would enable generation of carbon credits under relatively low RLs as well. In fact, applying a conservativeness principle for MRV of carbon emissions–to not overestimate the reduction of emissions–can critically reduce the accountable amount of carbon credits that can be claimed [29,30]. We used the Reliable Minimum Estimate (RME) as a method to discount uncertainties, however, the presented results could have been significantly different if uncertainties were addressed using another method. Pelletier et al. [72] showed that the degree of conservativeness applied can strongly influence the overall creditable emission reductions, and stated that downstream discounts (i.e., conservative approaches) should only be applied if the uncertainties exceed a certain threshold. We used the RME method and did not test other ones (e.g., the FCPF Carbon Fund Approach, the KP Conservativeness Factors and the CDM Draft Proposal): comparing alternative approaches to address uncertainties and evaluating the effects on the potential carbon credits goes beyond the scope of this study but is an important subject for future studies. Additionally, at present, no internationally standardized regulations exist for the management of uncertainties in this field.The relationship between monitoring costs and generation of carbon credits is not linear: increasing monitoring activities–and so the accuracy–beyond a certain threshold yields slightly larger generation of carbon credits. In this study, this threshold corresponds to a relative standard error of 2%. The relatively low error of carbon estimates assumed in this study depends, inter alia, on the biome homogeneity and the large sample size. However, the error trend simulated under the model-assisted approach is plausible [33,49]. We provided realistic figures of carbon monitoring costs according to data reported by the available literature. Clearly, these costs must be considered as indicative and should be interpreted with care because they might vary substantially from country to country; case-specific cost-benefit assessments are always essential.Another critical aspect affecting the successful implementation of REDD+ projects is the method used to set the RLs. RLs have a larger influence than the actual reduction of emissions on the generation of carbon credits, and the impact of RLs is almost as important as the approach used to monitor forest carbon. Findings highlight the crucial role of RLs, and bring a new insight on their effect on the accountable emissions reduction. The necessity of establishing RLs has been a key issue in the political agenda. While politicians and scientists have been mostly focusing on evaluating and investigating feasible, sound and effective methods to setting RLs [17,73,74], the extent to which RLs affect the performance of REDD+ projects remains uncertain. What is known is that incorrectly-determined RLs can generate under- or over-compensation, which would reduce both cost-efficiency and incentive to reduce emissions through the five REDD+ activities [75]. Sheng et al. [76] presented one of the few studies (to the best of our knowledge) that analyzes “how rate of carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation is influenced by underreported emissions caused by asymmetric information and RLs”. They claim that RLs are essential in the implementation of REDD+ and that overestimating RLs leads to an increase in actual emissions.Whether the REDD+ program will support forest carbon as a climate change mitigation strategy or not will depend on a number of aspects, which differ nationally and regionally. We only considered some factors that contribute to a successful implementation of REDD+ projects; we are fully aware that several other variables also have large impacts on the generation of carbon credits and deserve careful consideration. Our study does not take into consideration all the social, economic and policy aspects, which may often be of greater importance than technical and scientific matters. Nevertheless, our findings can represent a basic guidance for countries willing to design an MRV system, and provide new insights and a better understanding of some key elements that affect carbon credits generation, and thus results-based payments.", 4. Discussion,None,4
1213,"We analyzed some key factors underlying effective REDD+ projects and assessed, under various realistic circumstances, the potential generation of carbon credits. Three key factors mainly involved in the generation of carbon credits were investigated: defining reference levels, supplying emission reductions due to REDD+ and designing effective MRV systems. Carbon credit generation significantly depends on the MRV-system adopted to assess aboveground carbon density, and applying a model-assisted technique strongly influences the potential generation of carbon credits.Conceiving of an MRV system as an investment can encourage the implementation of well-defined, long-term monitoring strategies. Concurring with Pelletier et al. [72] we believe that the results-based payments could pay-off the necessary investment in technology that would enable an accurate estimate of activity data and emission factors. However, several barriers hinder fast progress. For example, finding stable, long-term sources of REDD+ finance remains a key outstanding issue.In conclusion, we believe that to understand MRV systems as an investment for generating carbon benefits, a REDD+ market-based architecture is necessary. This architecture would promote the reduction of emissions and gather the finances necessary to do so [77]. However, concerns over measurement and monitoring of forest-related activities prevent REDD+ carbon credits to be exchanged in compliance markets. To address these concerns and create favorable conditions for a market-based approach, transparent, robust, and consistent carbon accounting rules have to be established. To achieve low uncertainties in carbon estimates, like those reported in this study, important investments in MRV should be incentivized. In this connection, knowledge and technology transfer—such as statistical sampling methods and Lidar—from developed to developing countries should occur more widely and faster, and international programs (such as REDD+) could effectively boost innovative monitoring techniques in forest-rich countries [78].", 5. Conclusions,None,5
1214,"As essential terrestrial ecosystems, forests form an important part of the earth’s carbon cycle [1,2]. Forests not only play an indispensable role in various ecological and social services but also help maintain carbon balance and mitigate climate change, as they are considered carbon sinks [3,4,5,6,7]. The total carbon storage of forest is equivalent to 85% of total terrestrial stocks and 75% of total terrestrial gross primary production [8]. It is estimated that 50% of plant biomass is composed of carbon, and the estimated value of aboveground biomass (AGB) is used as a substitute for aboveground carbon [9]. The accurate estimation of terrestrial forest biomass is conducive to better understanding the crucial role of forests in the cycle of global carbon. Therefore, the accurate estimation of AGB can reduce the uncertainty of terrestrial carbon quantification [10,11]. However, for many current estimates of global carbon flux and biomass distribution in forests, there is still too much uncertainty due to the coarse estimation of vegetation structures for many scientific research and policy applications [10,12,13]. In regional or global mapping, the estimation of forest canopy height and AGB is directly related to the allometric growth equation. Therefore, improving the accuracy of forest canopy height estimation and enriching data sources are conducive to improving the accuracy of AGB estimation, which is an important research focus [14].The remote sensing system has been regarded as an indispensable practical tool because of due to its large-scale coverage and repeated observations. The combination of remote sensing satellite image data with field-measured forest inventory data can promote the production of reliable and up-to-date forest canopy height products [15]. As an active remote sensing method, light detection and ranging (Lidar) transmits energy and records the backscattered energy from feature information of the earth’s surface. Lidar can extract three-dimensional attributes and provide vegetation metrics by converting the time taken for data to be transmitted from and returned to a sensor into distance measurements [16]. The precise three-dimensional structure data obtained from airborne and spaceborne Lidar and measurements of forest canopy height, forest volume, and canopy cover have been successfully and widely monitored and estimated at multiple spatial scales [16,17,18,19,20,21].Forest canopy height extraction based on airborne Lidar can be conducted at the single tree scale and sample plot scale. Tree heights can be extracted by the discrete point cloud and canopy height model (CHM) obtained by airborne Lidar. Pang Yong established a univariate regression model using the height of the normalized point cloud (H75) and the measured tree height and compared and analyzed the effects of high- and low-density point clouds on the retrieved stand parameters [22]. Hirata used a watershed segmentation algorithm to identify individual trees from a CHM acquired by airborne Lidar [23]. The recognition rate of a single tree decreases with decreasing cutting intensity from 95.3% in severe logging areas to 60% in noncutting areas. Popescu extracted tree height and crown width measurements from a CHM obtained through airborne Lidar and established linear and nonlinear regression models with measured DBH, AGB and component biomass data (leaf and root) [16].However, the airborne Lidar is mainly used on a small scale due to its high data acquisition costs, limited data acquisition range and use of large amounts of data, as well as being labor intensive and time consuming, and it is difficult to use for large-scale forest vertical structure information extraction and mapping [24]. The ICESat with the Geoscience Laser Altimeter System (GLAS), as a representative spaceborne Lidar system, provides global footprint height information and is widely used in the retrieval of forest canopy heights at regional and global scales [25,26,27]. Lefsky combined waveform data from the GLAS and the terrain index extracted from SRTM DEM data to correct the slope of waveform data for an area with a large slope, and improved the estimation accuracy of the regression model of the maximum forest height [28]. The RMSE of the models for the three research areas ranged from 4.85 m to 12.66 m.The ICESat-2 with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) was launched in September 2018 as a follow-up mission to ICESat and aims to measure the structural characteristics of forests at the global scale and to complement other spaceborne Lidar missions [29,30], including the European Space Agency P-band radar BIOMASS [31], the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation Lidar (GEDI) [32], and NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar(NISAR) missions [33]. ICESat-2 was designed to draw a global image of Earth’s third dimension with height measurements and track terrain changes, including those for sea ice, glaciers, forests, etc. (https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/science), as well as the first spaceborne Lidar system ICESat GLAS. Therefore, it is necessary and meaningful to explore how data obtained by ICESat-2 can be applied to estimate forest canopy height or AGB.Montesano explored the abilities and uncertainties of ICESat-2 photon counting data in estimating coniferous forest biomass according to different biomass gradients and sampling distances along the orbit [34]. The authors found the 50 m scale to be the optimal horizontal resolution of ICESat-2 model fitting, and the biomass level was 20 Mg/ha with the estimation error of 20% to 50%. Gwenzi evaluated the potential of ATLAS data use for canopy height extraction from savanna ecosystems [14]. The authors found the correlation between canopy height extracted from the MATLAS simulator, which generates ATLAS-like data, and that from discrete return Lidar (DRL) to be weaker than that from Multiple Altimeter Beam Experimental Lidar (MABEL, an airborne photon counting Lidar sensor) data and predicted that the number of signal photons in spaceborne ATLAS data would be greatly reduced, causing the accuracy of canopy height estimation to decrease. Narine used simulated ICESat-2 photon counting Lidar data to generate point cloud data with the same along-orbit segmentation length as the ICESat-2 land vegetation product (ATL08), 100 m [15]. The relationship between photon counting vegetation products and forest AGB and canopy coverage obtained by airborne Lidar was analyzed in no-noise scenes, daytime scenes and night scenes [15]. Neuenschwander presented ATLAS data and verified the accuracy of its ground elevation [35,36,37]. The RMSE value of ground elevation data obtained from the ATLAS is 0.85 m, which is lower than that of the Space Shuttle Radar topographic survey mission (SRTM).However, few studies have used ICESat-2 vegetation height products to extrapolate and map regional vegetation canopy height [38,39], and most of them are based on ICESat-2 simulation data of airborne Lidar. The purpose of this paper is to explore ways to use the ATL08 and ATL03 products to map regional forest canopy heights with a 30 m resolution. There are many definitions of forest canopy height. Forest canopy height in this study refers to the mean height of trees within a given forest area. In this study, ICESat-2 ATLAS photon data and ZY-3 stereo image pair data are combined to generate a discontinuous CHM dataset. GEDI data are used to verify the accuracy of ground photon elevation and the DSM. The CHM is used to create a training sample, and the BP-ANN model is used to generate a forest canopy height map of the city of Nanning. Finally, this study analyzes resolution and how to filter effective data that emerge when ATL08 data are directly used to generate regional or global vegetation height products, which will be the focus of future research.", 1.

Geographically, Nanning is located between 22°13′ and 23°32′ north and 107°45′ and 108°51′ east with a total land area of 22,100 km2 (Figure 1). Nanning consists of eight administrative regions (municipal districts and the Yongning, Mashan, Binyang, Longan, Wuming, Shanglin, and Heng counties). Elevation in the study area ranges from 70 m to 600 m, and flat land is the main geomorphic type, accounting for 57.78% of the total area. The climate in Nanning is a subtropical monsoon with average annual precipitation levels ranging from 1241 mm to 1753 mm, and the average annual temperature is approximately 21.6 °C [40]. Additionally, the presence of abundant water and heat resources render Nanning rich in forest resources. The main tree species present are eucalyptus, masson pine and cunninghamia lanceolata. According to the results of the fifth Guangxi forest resources survey, in 2016, the forested area of Nanning reached 1,050,000 hectares, and the forest volume reached 51.99 million cubic meters (http://search.nanning.gov.cn/).", 2.

1216," 2.2.1. ICESat-2 ATLASThe Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) aboard ICESat-2 emits three pairs of beams with a spacing of 3.3 km and with a distance of approximately 90 m between the two beams. A pair consists of a strong and a weak beam. The diameter of the footprint is 14 m to 17 m and, the sampling interval along the track is set to 70 cm to facilitate intensive sampling and better capture elevation changes [29].ATL01 to ATL21 contain three levels of ICESat-2 mission products. The Level-2 product of global geolocated photons (ATL03) measures the latitude, longitude, time and absolute height above the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84) for each photon [41]. ATL03 provides photon information for all Level-3A products such as land, ice elevation (ATL06), Arctic/Antarctic sea ice elevation (ATL07), land, water and vegetation elevation (ATL08) data [42]. The corresponding data of three pairs of laser beams are numbered gt1l-gt3r, representing the six ground tracks (GT) from left to right. ATL08 provides terrain, canopy height, and canopy cover parameters at an along-track segment of 100 m, while the 100 m segment consists of 5 sequential 20 m segments labeled with segment IDs in ATL03 and ATL08 [43]. The canopy height was calculated by the 98% height of all individual relative canopy heights, which is derived from a surface fitting line and vegetation surface fitting line within a 100 m segment. ATL08 provides a photon classification label (Noise, Ground, Canopy, and Top of Canopy), and the labeling of ground photons is crucial for this study. In this study, ATL03 and ATL08 data were utilized in combination where ATL03 provided height and coordinate information while ATL08 provided photon classification information. ATL03 and ATL08 data were downloaded from the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC, https://nsidc.org/data/ATL03/versions/1, https://nsidc.org/data/ATL08/versions/1) (Table 1 and Table 2). ICESat-2 ATL03 and ATL08 data for the whole study area were acquired from October 30, 2018 to April 9, 2019, and data overlap with the locations of ZY-3 data for October 30, 2018 to November 03, 2018 (Table 1, Figure 2). 2.2.2. ZY-3 DataThe ZY-3 satellite, the first civil cartographic satellite designed for stereo photogrammetry in China launched in 2012, can measure ground heights and is mainly used for 1:50,000 topographic maps. Applying ZY-3 stereo image data for forestry research can generate a large area continuous digital surface model (DSM), which can effectively prevent errors caused by the spatial interpolation of discrete points. ZY-3 carries three panchromatic sensors pointing in the nadir, backward, and forward directions with resolutions of 2.1 m × 2.1 m, two 3.5 m × 3.5 m, respectively, and one multispectral sensor that consists of four bands (near infrared, red, green, and blue) with a resolution of 5.8 m × 5.8 m [44]. The ZY-3 02 satellite launched in 2016 is an upgraded successor of ZY-3 that have improved resolution of backward and forward panchromatic sensors from 3.5 m × 3.5 m to 2.7 m × 2.7 m [45]. ZY-3 and ZY-3 02 have the same ground swath of approximately 50 km × 50 km, and the same radiometric resolution of 10 bits [46].In this study, the ZY-3 and ZY-3 02 image data were downloaded from the China Centre for Resources Satellite Data and Application (CRESDA, http://www.cresda.com/CN/) with the acquisition period set to 10 March 2018 to 5 October 2018 considering data availability and cloud cover (Table 1). Due to the presence of considerably more mountain shadows in forward view scenes, nadir and backward view panchromatic scenes were utilized to extract the DSM while using multispectral scenes to extract the forest area. 2.2.3. Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager DataLandsat 8 with the Operational Land Imager (OLI) sensor provides satellite images with wavelengths of 0.43 μm to 1.38 μm. OLI images were obtained from the United States Geological Survey (USGS, https://glovis.usgs.gov/) on 31 October 2018 and 6 October 2018 (Table 1). The three scenes show less than 5% cloud cover. Bands 1–7, which contain four visible bands, one near infrared band and two shortwave infrared bands with a resolution of 30 m × 30 m, were utilized to extract the forest area by maximum likelihood classification (MLC) to calculate the vegetation indices and to estimate the forest canopy height of the study area. Preprocessing operations used included geometric correction, radiometric calibration, and atmospheric correction by the Fast Line-of-Sight Atmospheric Analysis of Hypercubes (FLAASH) module in ENVI to eliminate atmospheric effects.This study refers to the existing literature, and a total of ten indices are selected for analysis [44,47,48], including MSR, SLAVI, NDVI, and others (Table 3). 2.2.4. GEDIThe Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), the first spaceborne Lidar system designed specifically for studies of forest structures and launched in 2018, is an Earth Venture Instrument (EVI) developed by NASA and equipped with three lasers and full waveform recording Lidar instrument aboard the International Space Station (ISS) [56,57]. The GEDI operates at 1064 nm and produces eight beam ground tracks spaced approximately 600 m apart in the cross-track direction and sampling approximately 60 m along a track from a 4.2 km wide swath. Each footprint reflects Lidar energy with a diameter of approximately 30 m and a vertical measurement accuracy level of approximately 2–3 cm [57,58]. GEDI L2A product data with ground elevation and relative height (RH) metrics were taken from NASA’s Land Processes Distributed Active Archive Center (LPDAAC, https://e4ftl01.cr.usgs.gov/GEDI/GEDI02_A.001/) using GEDI Finder to locate GEDI orbits (files) that intersect with the study area. GEDI data for 29 April 2019 to 1 October 2019 were acquired as the only GEDI data available for the study area when this study was conducted (Table 2). The GEDI ground tracks are displayed in Figure 3. 2.2.5. Field Plots and Auxiliary DataA total of 66 field plots for 15 to 21 January 2018 were obtained to implement an independent accuracy assessment of estimated canopy height. Every field plot covers a 30 m × 30 m square area with information on measured mean canopy height and other forest structure parameters (Figure 1). Considering the economic costs and availability of field survey data, some of the field measurement points are scattered across the study area and the rest are concentrated within the Gaofeng forest farm. All trees with a diameter at breast height (DBH) of greater than 5 cm in each plot were recorded. The forest canopy height of each tree was derived from distance and angle measurements. Distance was measured by a hand-held laser range finder, and angles were measured by a mechanical clinometer. The forest canopy height of the recorded trees was used to calculate the mean canopy height of each square. The coordinates of the southwest and northeast corners of each plot were recorded by GPS, and the center points of the two recorded points were calculated and was taken as the plot coordinates.SRTMGL1 data were used in collecting ground control points (GCPs) during the extraction of the DSM with ZY-3 data and were taken from NASA.

1222,"A new canopy height estimation method was developed by combining the ICESat-2 ATLAS data with ZY-3 stereo images. Figure 4 shows the flowchart for this study which consists of five sections: (1) Calculating the elevation of ground photons in 30 m × 30 m pixels; (2) Extracting the ZY-3 DSM; (3) Producing a discontinuous canopy height model (CHM) dataset after validation; (4) Estimating the forest canopy height by the BP-ANN model; and (5) Assessing the accuracy of the estimated canopy height map. 2.3.1. Processing ICESat-2/ATLAS ATL08 and ATL03 DataLight beams from the ATLAS laser hits the earth’s surface, and a handful of photons are then reflected back to the laser. The number of returning photons depends on the outgoing energy, solar and atmospheric conditions and on surface reflectance. The number of ground photons is significantly greater than that of vegetation because the reflectance of the terrain surface is typically approximately 0.3, which is higher than 0.1 of vegetation [43]. The ATL03 data product not only provides basic information on photons (latitude, longitude, and height of the WGS84 ellipsoid) but also extracts signal photons from noise photons. In producing the ATL08 data product, further filtering techniques to remove noise photons, ground finding filter, and canopy top filter were conducted orderly to label all the signal photons in ground, canopy and noise, respectively.In this study, ground photons were used as the DEM to provide land surface height information. Densely distributed ground photons were resampled into a 30 m × 30 m grid with an average ground photon height (Figure 5). As a result, a total of 409,515 ground photons were processed into 22,437 new points. Then, if the number of ground photons in a 30 m × 30 m grid was less than 4, the new point was deemed ineffective and was removed since the expected number of signal photons per laser for the vegetated surface is 0 to 4 photons [43]. For example, “p5” shown in Figure 5c was removed. 2.3.2. Extracting the DSMThe digital surface model (DSM) was derived from ZY-3 and ZY-3 02 stereo images using PCI Geomatica Banff 2019 software with the OrthoEngine module. A nadir and backward-looking stereo pair with an inclination angle of ±22°–23.5° between the sensors was used for processing due to the presence of fewer mountain shadows. The OrthoEngine module’s main purpose is to compute a math model that associates columns and rows of the matched pixels with ground coordinates (X, Y) and elevations (Z) using rational polynomial coefficients (RPCs), GCPs and tie points (TPs) [45]. The RPC file was distributed with the ZY-3 data file. The Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm was used in the module to match pixels [46]. A total of 92 GCPs and 62 TPs were collected automatically at a variety of elevations with less than two pixel residual errors, meeting the recommended minimum value requirements [59]. The resolution of the output DSM was set to 2 m × 2 m to maintain surface details and preserve precision [44,45].A two-step mask extraction operation was implemented to obtain the effective DSM: (1) The score band of PCI output can specify the reliability of DSM values, and values of 90 to 100 denote a good pixel; and (2) The forest area of ZY-3 coverage was classified by MLC using ZY-3 multispectral images. To meet the 30 m × 30 m resolution mapping requirement, the average value of the 30 m × 30 m grid was calculated for subsequent processing. 2.3.3. Calculating a Discontinuous CHM DatasetIn a large number of studies, a CHM is obtained by subtracting DSM and DEM layers. However, the existing high-precision and high-resolution DEM is mostly obtained via ground point cloud fitting using airborne Lidar, and the DSM is obtained from the vegetation surface fitted by stereo image pairs or vegetation point clouds. In this study, the ground photon height of spaceborne Lidar is used as the DEM, making it possible to use the point sampling DEM of spaceborne Lidar, which could be applied for large-scale and high-efficiency CHM sampling and regional or global canopy height mapping.The DSM derived from ZY-3 data and by subtracting calculated ground photons’ average height values provides a discontinuous CHM dataset as canopy height samples. Figure 6 shows the profile of the discontinuous CHM dataset. The heights of all the data were based on the WGS 84 ellipsoid. Red, purple, and back dots represent the ZY-3 DSM, ground photon DEM, and original ground photons, respectively. Distances between red and purple dots denote canopy heights. Similarly, ZY-3 and Landsat 8 forest areas were used as masks to extract effective CHM samples. A total of 1229 CHM points were derived after filtering. 2.3.4. Validating ZY-3 DSM and Ground Photon Values via GEDIThe evaluation of ZY-3 DSM and ground photon average value accuracy is necessary for further analysis. The waveform for each footprint was processed to determine terrain elevations and canopy heights relative to the WGS84 ellipsoid. The elevation of the center of the lowest mode from the Gauss fitting curve of return energy was used to validate the accuracy of the ground photons’ average height values while the elevation of the highest detected return was used to validate that of the ZY-3 DSM.We assume the following: if the grid of 30 m resolution Landsat data in which GEDI footprint points are located is the same as the grid of newly calculated ground photon values, they are considered to be intersected, that is, the same point. To obtain as many intersection points as possible, all GEDI data for April to October 2019 that are currently open access were downloaded. The GEDI DEM corresponding to these intersection points was used to verify the average height values of ground photons. In total, 61 intersection points were extracted (Figure 3). 2.3.5. BP-ANN Modeling, Extrapolation and ValidationThe Backpropagation—Artificial Neural Network (BP-ANN) was used to model the relationship between canopy height and vegetation indices derived from Landsat data and to predict canopy height. More than 30 types of neural networks, such as black-box algorithm models, have been developed since the first prototype was proposed [60,61]. This model has been widely used in various fields due to its powerful prediction and forecasting capabilities [60,62,63,64].For model building, a three-layer BP neural network model with 10 input layer neurons, 11 hidden layer neurons and one output layer was constructed. The ten vegetation indices were used as input layers. In total, 80% of the model training samples were randomly selected from the discontinuous CHM dataset for a total of 983 samples. The “scikit-learn” package in python was used to implement BP-ANN model training. A wall-to-wall forest canopy height map was derived by extrapolating the BP-ANN model to the whole study area with ten vegetation index bands.For accuracy evaluation, the mapping accuracy of canopy heights was independently validated using three validation datasets that consist of the remaining 20% CHM dataset, a total of 66 field plots, and their combination. The root mean square error (RMSE) was calculated to quantify the error of the estimated forest canopy:

The validation results for ground photon elevation with the SRTM DEM shows an R2 = 0.997 and an RMSE = 6.76 m (Table 5).Errors of the three precision verifications mentioned above mainly result from the following: (a) There is a deviation in the data acquisition time, as the GEDI only has data for 2019. (b) Figure 9b shows that the scatter fitting line is below 1:1 because the highest point of the first return Gaussian fitting peak of GEDI full waveform data represents the top of vegetation, which is significantly different from the capacity for ZY-3 stereo images to capture the top of vegetation and which is caused by the difference in sensor imaging. (c) The different sensors have varied effects. In this study, the 30 m × 30 m resolution ground photon elevation is calculated, and the spot diameter of the GEDI is exactly 30 m. (d) Terrain factors will significantly affect the reliability of waveform data. When data conditions permit, a more reliable verification result will be obtained by applying airborne Lidar in the study area.", 3. Results, 3.2.

1230,"Figure 10 shows the forest canopy height estimated by the BP-ANN with training samples of the discontinuous CHM dataset. The estimated forest canopy height range of 3 m to 34 m is similar to the field measured forest canopy height range of 6.2 m to 29.2 m. Across the study area, forest canopy heights of 11 to 14 m accounted for the largest proportion. The spatial distribution of the estimated forest canopy height was found to be related to the elevation of the study area. The height of the forest canopy in mountainous areas of elevations of greater than 300 m is more than 11 m as opposed to that in bare area. Due to the effects of human activities and urban expansion, the spatial distribution of forests in plain areas is relatively fragmented while the distribution of forests in mountainous areas is relatively continuous. Most of the latter are evergreen coniferous forests with a long cutting period and evergreen broad-leaved forests with a short cutting period, such as eucalyptus forests. In addition, the unique karst landforms in Guangxi, especially in Longan County in western Nanning, are mostly distributed across natural forests because they cannot be used as cultivated land. The distribution of forest canopy height is random and is not as uniform as that of artificial forest.Figure 11 shows scatter plots of independent accuracy validation for the estimated forest canopy height using 20%, a total of 257 CHM datasets, 66 field measured plots, and a combination of them. The elevation of field measured plots varies from 90 m to 402 m, with slopes of 1° to 36°. The age of the forest ranges from 2 years to 56 years, which was estimated by local forestry experts in the field. The average forest canopy height of field measured plots is 13.32 m. The validation results shown in Figure 11a–c present an R2 = 0.51 and an RMSE of 3.34 m for part of the discontinuous CHM dataset, an R2 = 0.51 and an RMSE of 3.47 m based on field measured plots, an R2 = 0.51 and an RMSE for 3.38 m based on the combination of both, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the BP-ANN model (Table 6).", 3.

1231,"We identified a new means to estimate forest canopy height using a combination of ICESat-2 ATLAS data and stereo-photogrammetry. This method uses spaceborne Lidar ICESat-2 ATLAS data to replace airborne Lidar data and in turn obtain ground elevation information. Its low cost, unlimited data acquisition range, and global sampling range allow it to be the ability to be applied to a wider range. Given our successful application of this method to a study area in Nanning, it can be used over large scales, such as regional and global forest canopy height mapping. In addition to the stereo image pairs provided by the ZY-3 satellite, China’s first submeter high-resolution optical transmission stereo mapping satellite GF-7 can provide high-precision stereo image pair data for superimposing ICESat-2 data to estimate global forest canopy height. Although GF-2 was not designed as a photogrammetric system, some studies have made use of the different orbit data from GF-2 in repeated observation areas to realize stereo observation and extract DSM data [65].Additionally, other techniques such as radargrammetry can produce a DSM by using SAR images to replace the DSM derived from ZY-3 in this study [44,45]. In addition to ICESat-2, the GEDI can provide surface elevation information as a DEM [32,57,58].In addition, to obtain mapping results with the same resolution as those of Landsat, 30 m × 30 m grid is used to process ground photons. If we want to obtain a lower resolution result, such as those of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), this is feasible, but for higher resolution mapping, we should consider enough ground photons to increase the accuracy and reliability of the DEM. Further analysis and research are needed.", 4. Discussion, 4.1. Large Scale Forest Canopy Height Mapping,4
1232,"The canopy height values provided by ATL08 data can be used as samples to directly generate a wall-to-wall forest canopy height map. Since the resolution of ATL08 data is 100 m, ATL08 data are not suitable for vegetation mapping at a 30 m resolution as with Landsat data, and should be used to map at resolutions of greater than 100 m to eliminate errors caused by position deviations. The selection of effective ATL08 data is a key problem. These two fitting lines are highly dependent on the accuracy of photon classification, creating inevitable errors in the canopy height values of ATL08.Our numerical analysis shows that, for ATL08 data of the study area, 6% of canopy height values are greater than 50 m, which can be considered invalid values. These invalid values may originate from the low precision surface and vegetation surface curves fitted by sparse signal photons, or even attribute values obtained by interpolation. For the remaining 94% of the data, even if we use the rest of the ATL08 data fields (such as clouds, snow, and urban areas) to exclude the influence of land surface types and clouds, the reliability of canopy height data is affected by many other factors. For instance, (1) irregular topography increases photon classification errors, and (2) when the photon signal of a surface or vegetation is weak and the number of point clouds is small, the fitting error of the surface curve will increase.Many uncertain factors make it difficult to automatically filter effective data when data are used in regional mapping. Figure 12 shows a frequency statistics histogram of canopy and ground photons. We suggest that canopy and ground photon numbers be used as a basis for screening effective ATL08 data, as the stronger the photon signal, the smaller the error becomes. However, determining the photon number threshold with universal or adaptive rules is an issue worthy of future research.", 4. Discussion, 4.2. How to Filter Effective ATL08 Data,4
1233,"This study proposes a new means with which to estimate forest canopy height, which used a combination of ICESat-2 ATLAS data and ZY-3 stereo images to extract a discontinuous CHM dataset as training samples and extrapolated the BP-ANN model to the whole study area with ten vegetation index bands from Landsat 8 images. Ground photons of ATL08 and ATL03 were recalculated to obtain the average terrain height value for a 30 m × 30 m grid. A discontinuous CHM dataset was derived from the ZY-3 DSM by subtracting new ground photon heights. The accuracy of the ZY-3 DSM and ground photons’ average values was evaluated by GEDI data. The validation results show an R2 of greater than 0.991 and an RMSE of approximately 6 m, and the source of the observed error was discussed in detail. Regional forest canopy height mapping with a resolution of 30 m was executed based on the BP-ANN model using the CHM dataset as a training sample combined with vegetation indices from Landsat 8 data. The independent accuracy validation for the estimated forest canopy height shows an R2 = 0.51 and an RMSE from 3.34 m to 3.47 m based on part of the CHM dataset and field measured plots.This paper presents a very promising means to map forest canopy heights at regional and global scales. It uses spaceborne Lidar data instead of airborne Lidar data to provide terrain information at a low cost and with global coverage. In the future, other types of data, such as radar image generating DSM and GEDI providing ground information can adopt the method used in this work, which will be conducive to the realization of multiple data sources that complement each other and work together to map regional forest canopy heights. Methods of selecting effective ATL08 data to extrapolate a wall-to-wall forest canopy height should be the focus of future research work.", 5. Conclusions,None,5
1234,"Reliable, up-to-date forest aboveground biomass (AGB) mapping is a prerequisite for understanding the relationship between AGB and climate change. Plot-based estimations of forest AGB, while typically of high accuracy, are costly and can only provide quality information for a limited number of stands at the landscape scale [1]. Consequently, numerous remote sensing techniques have been increasingly utilized to assist forest AGB estimation during the last few decades [2]. It is possible to provide updated, consistent, and spatially explicit assessment of forest biomass and its dynamics by using remote sensing images, particularly in large areas with limited accessibility [3,4].Numerous statistical models have been explored in relating field-measured AGB to remotely sensed variables [5,6]. Multispectral vegetation indices (SVIs), defined with various combinations of visible, near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave reflectance, are the most widely used for retrieving biophysical and biochemical parameters. It is proved that SVIs have strong correlations with vegetation structure characteristics, such as AGB and leaf area index (LAI) [7,8,9]. However, vegetation indices tend to saturate for forests at high biomass levels [10,11,12]. The saturation point varies greatly depending on the source data and the vegetation type and ranges from 15 to 100 Mg/ha for different visible/NIR vegetation indices [13,14]. Additionally, optical remote sensing provides limited information on the vertical distribution of forest structure [15], and it is not always possible to compile a temporally and radiometrically consistent cloud-free datasets over large areas [3]. The past two decades have witnessed a large number of studies using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), which could penetrate clouds and forest canopies with appropriate wavelength and polarization modes, for mapping forest AGB [16,17,18,19]. However, it remains problematic to estimate AGB using SAR backscattering signals due not only to the saturation at high biomass levels but also to the high sensitivity to soil conditions, including surface roughness and soil moisture [19,20].Recently, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has proven to be very powerful in estimating forest structure attributes, such as canopy height, leaf area index (LAI), and AGB [21,22,23,24]. The most commonly used LiDAR metrics are height metrics which can be directly measured by LiDAR and provide information related to the vertical structure of individual trees and forest stands. The prevalence of LiDAR data in forest studies is attributed to its penetration by which layered structural echoes through a certain canopy depth can be detected. However, LiDAR data cannot provide sufficient spectral characteristics of vegetation canopies since most LiDAR systems only work at a single wavelength [25]. Although hyperspectral LiDAR systems have emerged to capture spectral and structural information simultaneously [26,27,28], they are mainly tested inside the laboratory. It is, thus, not feasible to apply these new systems to normal data collection in large areas [26]. Therefore, the integration of LiDAR data with optical remote sensing imagery has been identified as the most promising approach to acquire structural and spectral information from forests simultaneously for biomass estimation. Combining both airborne LiDAR and hyperspectral data has shown great capability to map tree species in different forest areas [29,30]. In addition, Graham [31] found that retrieval of canopy LAI in a coniferous and broadleaf mixed forest can be improved by integrating LiDAR with WorldView-2 data.The parametric models, such as multiple regression, are commonly used to develop relationships between forest attributes and remote sensing predictors [32,33]. In recent years, non-parametric machine learning models have become prevalent. Contrary to the linear regression model, many machine learning techniques (e.g., Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Deep learning (DL)) are able to reveal complicated non-linear patterns [9,34,35]. Additionally, machine learning models are able to address issues associated with data dimensionality [36,37] in fitting models with a large number of predictors. Few studies have integrated LiDAR data with optical remote sensing metrics to estimate forest structure parameters using non-parametric machine learning algorithms, especially the deep learning models. The deep learning algorithms have shown their effectiveness in object detection and image classification [38,39,40,41,42,43]. The deep learning models can automatically extracted invariant and abstract features which have better discrimination than artificial features. As one of the deep learning algorithms, the Stacked Sparse Autoencoder network (SSAE) has been widely used in some fields, especially image classification [43]. Besides, few studies paid attention to the comparisons between deep learning and other machine learning algorithms in predicting forest parameters. Therefore, in this study, airborne LiDAR data were integrated with Landsat 8 imagery for mapping forest aboveground biomass. The objectives of the study were (i) to evaluate the potentials of optical spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) and LiDAR metrics, respectively, for estimating forest AGB; (ii) to determine if the combined LiDAR and Landsat 8 indices can enhance the AGB estimation; and (iii) to provide a comparison of five predictive models, i.e., K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Stacked Sparse Autoencoder network (SSAE), and multiple stepwise linear regressions (MSLR) models, for estimating biomass.", 1.

The elevation ranges from about 196 m in the northeast of the area to approximately 620 m in the southwest. This area has a subtropical monsoon climate. The mean annual temperature and rainfall are about 22.1 °C and 1952.5 mm, respectively.

1236,"Aboveground biomass values of 236 inventory plots distributed across the study area were collected in 2013. The locations of plots were selected according to the subjective sampling evaluations, and the size of each plot was 30 m × 30 m. The tree height (H) was measured using a laser hypsometer, and the tree diameter at breast height (DBH) was measured using a tape. The center of each plot was correctly determined using a GPS (Garmin MAP 60CS, accuracy ±3 m). Additionally, the species and type (i.e., evergreen or deciduous) of each tree were recorded. Trees with DBH more than or equal to 3 cm were measured in the survey. Subsequently, a plot would be classified into a coniferous (deciduous) plot, when it consisted of over 75% coniferous (deciduous) trees [44]. Otherwise, we identified the plot as the mixed forest [45]. The observed plots (n = 236) were randomly split into training (n = 177) and validation (n = 59) datasets at a ratio of 3:1.In general, AGB of each individual tree in the plot can be derived by using species-specific allometric equations with inputs of the DBH and H [20,46,47]. However, no allometric equations are available for the study area. Accordingly, the methodology put forward by Fang et al. [48] was employed to calculate the biomass at the plot level. In this method, the relationship between total volumes and total AGB of each plot is shown in Equation (1). The total volumes could be obtained by adding up the volumes of all individual trees in the plot. The single tree volume was estimated based on a volume table with inputs of H and DBH.

1237,"The Landsat 8 image used in the study was acquired on the 3rd of August 2014. The image was acquired during an almost clear and sunny sky condition with 5% cloud cover, sun azimuth angle of 102.15 and sun elevation angle of 65.12. The Landsat 8 satellite contains two pushbroom instruments, i.e., the Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) including two thermal infrared bands at a 100 m spatial resolution. The Landsat 8-OLI is composed of 30 m multispectral bands corresponding to band 1—coastal/aerosol (0.433–0.453 μm), band 2—blue (0.450–0.515 μm), band 3—green (0.525–0.600 μm), band 4—red (0.630–0.680 μm), band 5—NIR (0.845–0.885 μm), band 6—SWIR1 (1.560–1.660 μm), band 7—SWIR2 (2.100–2.300 μm), and band 9—Cirrus (1.360–1.390 μm), in addition to a 15 m panchromatic image (band 8, 0.500–0.680 μm). Preprocessing was performed using the ENVI 5.1 software. The Landsat-8 OLI image bands were converted from digital number format (DN) to Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) spectral radiance, following steps summarized on the USGS website. Subsequently, the Landsat 8 OLI image was atmospherically corrected to surface reflectance using the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercube (FLAASH).

The pulse frequency was 52.9 kHz and the flying speed was 80 knots, producing an average density of 0.8 pulses/m2. The LiDAR data was preprocessed using the Terrascan software (v4.006-Terrasolid, Helsinki, Finland). Firstly, the points were removed if they had only few neighbors and/or their elevations were higher than the median elevation of surrounding points. The points were then classified as ground and non-ground returns. The ground returns were interpolated to produce a digital elevation model (DEM), and the first returns were interpolated to derive a digital surface model (DSM) with a resolution of 1 m. Finally, a Canopy Height Model (CHM) was generated by subtracting the DEM from the DSM. According to the minimum and maximum height of field-measured trees within the area, the CHM pixels with values ranging from 2 m to 35 m were extracted to ensure the understory vegetation and objects exceeding the tree height were excluded [21,49,50].", 2.

1242,"In the study, five prediction techniques including KNN, RF, SVR, SSAE, and MSLR were used to estimate biomass. The RF technique is based on an ensemble of binary regression trees that are fitted to randomly selected subsets of the training data. In addition to resampling the observations to obtain multiple trees, the RF algorithm also selects a random subset of predictors in tree construction, which is particularly useful when a great number of possibly redundant predictors are available. It has been reported to be an efficient prediction approach for estimating vegetation attributes, especially when the number of predictors is very large [35,53,54]. In [35], the RF was compared with other prediction methods in regard to their predictive power of forest AGB, and RF showed a better estimation accuracy than other algorithms. SVR identifies optimum hyperplanes using kernel functions to separate groups of input data with similar responses to predict a target variable. The SVR model has been successfully applied in biomass mapping and other remote sensing applications [55,56]. In KNN method, the distance from an unknown pixel of the target dataset to each of the known pixels in the reference dataset is computed. The unknown target pixel is assigned a weighted mean of the k most similar neighbours, which is computed based on their distance to the target pixel in the feature space [57]. Tian et al. [34] found the performance of KNN outperformed those of other algorithms for estimating forest biomass using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. SSAE is a kind of deep learning method that can automatically learn useful features layer by layer. The SSAE deep learning algorithm has been successfully used in several fields, such as image classification [39,43]. Nonetheless, as far as we know, this model was rarely applied to estimate forest parameters. Therefore, the SSAE algorithm was introduced in detail in the following. When SSAE model builds a deep neural network to extract deep features, it utilizes a hierarchical training strategy. The model comprises some sparse autoencoder networks (SAEs), and each SAE consists of two parts: an encoder and a decoder. After each SAE is trained, its decoded layer is removed and then an SSAE is established using the encoder parameters of all SAEs in a layer-by-layer manner. Afterwards, this network is linked to a regression model to implement the prediction work. That is to say, an SSAE model is comprised of the trained SAEs and the regression model. The MSLR was taken into consideration in order to compare the prediction performances of the more prevalent and complex machine learning models with that of the frequently-used parametric model.We employed the R statistical package [58] to implement RF, SVR, KNN, and MSLR models. The Deep Learning toolbox, an open source library (https://github.com/rasmusbergpalm/DeepLearnToolbox#deeplearntoolbox), was modified to perform SSAE algorithm.", 3. Methodology, 3.2.

Experiment 1: univariate linear or nonlinear regression models were developed based on a single SVI or LiDAR variable; Experiment 2: each COLI was used to establish the univariate linear or nonlinear regression model; Experiment 3: four data combinations were individually fitted to all the five prediction models described in Section 3.2. The four data combinations included (i) all the COLI1 (ACOLI1), (ii) all the COLI2 (ACOLI2), (iii) ACOLI1 and all the optical (AO) and LiDAR variables (AL), and (iv) ACOLI2, AO and AL.

1244," 4.1.1. Relationships between SVIs or LiDAR Metrics and AGB (Experiment 1)The statistical regression analysis was used to model relationships between SVIs and biomass. Accuracy assessment of each modeling case is shown in Table 3. The best statistical model was found by using the OSAVI as the input variable (R2 = 0.594, RMSE = 37.097 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 27.004%), followed by using the NDVI (R2 = 0.563, RMSE = 37.702 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 27.445%). The EVI fitted model yielded the lowest R2 and highest RMSE and RMSEr values (0.209, 52.012 Mg/ha and 37.861%, respectively). Overall, in the experiment 1, statistical models with the single SVI did not show satisfactory performance with the R2 < 0.6 and RMSE > 37 Mg/ha. Table 4 shows moderate to good modeling performances for AGB estimation by using LiDAR metrics. The variables of p60 and Cov had the highest (R2 = 0.696, RMSE = 31.326 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 22.803%) and lowest correlations (R2 = 0.463, RMSE = 47.298 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 34.43%) with biomass, respectively. The model with the input variable of Hmean yielded the next best performance with an R2 of 0.684 and RMSE of 32.127 Mg/ha. It was noted that statistical models fitted by LiDAR metrics generally resulted in higher R2 and smaller RMSE values than those fitted by the optical variables. The differences in R2 and RMSE between the best LiDAR variable based model and the best optical variable based model were approximately 0.1 and 5.77 Mg/ha, respectively. 4.1.2. Relationships between COLIs and AGB (Experiment 2)As shown in Table 4, the variable of Hmean had a relatively good correlation with biomass, following the variable of p60. Previous studies have used the LiDAR height metrics Hmean as effective prior knowledge in the sampling design [59,60] because Hmean can be treated as a direct indicator of the forest structure and growth status. Therefore, two types of the combined optical and LiDAR indices (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) were generated by integrating Hmean with each of the seven SVIs according to Equations (3) and (4), respectively. More details on COLI1 and COLI2 were provided in Section 3.1.2.Table 5 shows AGB predictions could be improved by statistical models that have both Hmean and one of the SVIs as input variables, compared to those using either optical or LiDAR data alone. Among all the models in COLI1, the statistical model with input variable of OSAVI×Hmean had the best modeling performance with an R2 of 0.788 and RMSE of 24.787 Mg/ha. In COLI2, the best statistical model (R2 = 0.763, RMSE = 26.568 Mg/ha) was achieved by using OSAVI_Hmean as well. Additionally, it was observed that statistical models in COLI1 generally had slightly better perfomance than those in COLI2. The differences in R2 and RMSE between the model using the best COLI1 (OSAVI×Hmean) and the model using the best COLI2 (OSAVI_Hmean) reached about 0.03 and 1.78 Mg/ha, respectively.

1245,"The statistical regression analysis was used to model relationships between SVIs and biomass. Accuracy assessment of each modeling case is shown in Table 3. The best statistical model was found by using the OSAVI as the input variable (R2 = 0.594, RMSE = 37.097 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 27.004%), followed by using the NDVI (R2 = 0.563, RMSE = 37.702 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 27.445%). The EVI fitted model yielded the lowest R2 and highest RMSE and RMSEr values (0.209, 52.012 Mg/ha and 37.861%, respectively). Overall, in the experiment 1, statistical models with the single SVI did not show satisfactory performance with the R2 < 0.6 and RMSE > 37 Mg/ha. Table 4 shows moderate to good modeling performances for AGB estimation by using LiDAR metrics. The variables of p60 and Cov had the highest (R2 = 0.696, RMSE = 31.326 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 22.803%) and lowest correlations (R2 = 0.463, RMSE = 47.298 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 34.43%) with biomass, respectively. The model with the input variable of Hmean yielded the next best performance with an R2 of 0.684 and RMSE of 32.127 Mg/ha. It was noted that statistical models fitted by LiDAR metrics generally resulted in higher R2 and smaller RMSE values than those fitted by the optical variables. The differences in R2 and RMSE between the best LiDAR variable based model and the best optical variable based model were approximately 0.1 and 5.77 Mg/ha, respectively.", 4. Results, 4.1.1. Relationships between SVIs or LiDAR Metrics and AGB (Experiment 1),4
1246,"As shown in Table 4, the variable of Hmean had a relatively good correlation with biomass, following the variable of p60. Previous studies have used the LiDAR height metrics Hmean as effective prior knowledge in the sampling design [59,60] because Hmean can be treated as a direct indicator of the forest structure and growth status. Therefore, two types of the combined optical and LiDAR indices (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) were generated by integrating Hmean with each of the seven SVIs according to Equations (3) and (4), respectively. More details on COLI1 and COLI2 were provided in Section 3.1.2.Table 5 shows AGB predictions could be improved by statistical models that have both Hmean and one of the SVIs as input variables, compared to those using either optical or LiDAR data alone. Among all the models in COLI1, the statistical model with input variable of OSAVI×Hmean had the best modeling performance with an R2 of 0.788 and RMSE of 24.787 Mg/ha. In COLI2, the best statistical model (R2 = 0.763, RMSE = 26.568 Mg/ha) was achieved by using OSAVI_Hmean as well. Additionally, it was observed that statistical models in COLI1 generally had slightly better perfomance than those in COLI2. The differences in R2 and RMSE between the model using the best COLI1 (OSAVI×Hmean) and the model using the best COLI2 (OSAVI_Hmean) reached about 0.03 and 1.78 Mg/ha, respectively. Figure 3 shows AGB comparisons between field observations and model predictions using different data scenarions: (a) OSAVI, (b) Hmean, (c) OSAVI×Hmean, and (d) OSAVI_Hmean.

1247,"The MSLR, KNN, SVR, RF and SSAE algorithms were individually adopted to estimate biomass using ACOLI1, ACOLI2, the combination of ACOLI1, AO and AL, and the combination of ACOLI2, AO and AL. Table 6 shows that the SSAE model has the best modeling performance, followed by the RF model. The MSLR model, in most cases, produced the most error in AGB estimate with the lowest R2 and highest RMSE values. Figure 4 shows comparisons between field surveys and predicted AGB values derived from the five prediction models calibrated by variables of ACOLI1, AO and AL. Obvious differences in modeling performances among the five prediction algorithms could be identified. The SSAE model showed higher agreements between the model estimates and field observations than other models. Additionally, results showed that the prediction accuracy was improved with increased input variables, i.e., the models with input variables of ACOLI1 (ACOLI2), AO and AL achieved better performances than those with ACOLI1 (ACOLI2). Furthermore, slightly better prediction accuracies were observed for the models calibrated by ACOLI1, AO and AL integrated variables compared to those by ACOLI2, AO and AL. The best performing model, SSAE with ACOLI1, AO and AL integrated variables, reached a R2 of 0.935, a RMSE of 15.67 Mg/ha and a RMSEr of 11.407%.", 4. Results, 4.2.

The non-forested regions were considered to have low biomass levels. In view of the raw LiDAR information located in the black rectangle of Figure 5 was missing, this part did not participate in the AGB retrieval.", 4. Results, 4.3. Wall-to-Wall Predictions,4
1249,"In the study, the combined optical and LiDAR indices, i.e., COLI1 and COLI2, were developed by integrating the best-performing LiDAR predictor (i.e., Hmean) with each of the SVIs derived from the Landsat 8 OLI image. Both COLIs (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) improved the biomass estimation accuracy compared to either the optical-only or LiDAR-only variable. This was in accordance with earlier studies [32,35,61,62]. Most of these studies used other approaches to combine optical and LiDAR data for estimating vegetation parameters. Usually, the common approach is the loosely coupled design [32,35,61,62,63,64]. For example, Kulawardhana et al. [32] found that the multiple regression models with input variables from the fusion of LiDAR metrics and multispectral vegetation indices had better performances than those calibrated by either the sole LiDAR or multispectral data for vegetation biomass predictions. In Li et al. [62], the statistical model using combined LiDAR and GF-1 data achieved a satisfactory performance for the maize AGB estimation. In this study, new indices were designed, and this approach presented a novel synergistic way of effectively estimating forest biomass. The satisfactory performances of COLIs can be attributed to the ability of multispectral images to provide surface information about canopy density and cover and the ability of LiDAR data to measure forests information about the branches and stems of the trees. Additionally, although COLI1 fitted models generally achieved smaller RMSE and higher R2 values than COLI2 fitted models, differences in model predictions between them were slight. It was revealed that OSAVI×Hmean and OSAVI_Hmean could be used for accurate estimates of forest biomass, along with the fact that the other combined indices were also valuable (Table 5). Overall, it was concluded that the proposed COLIs could improve forest biomass predictions since weaknesses and limitations of one predictor might be compensated through the other one. However, the COLIs should experience further investigations and validations before the extensive application.", 5. Discussion , 5.1. Biomass Estimation Using COLI,5
1250,"To the best of our knowledge, the applications of deep learning models in estimating vegetation parameters are much less common, although they have been investigated by previous studies for many other fields, such as object detection and image classification [38,39,40,41,42,43]. The estimation performance of SSAE deep learning technique outperformed the other four models. This may be attributed to the fact that SSAE can automatically learn deep spatial sparse features of data layer by layer. In SSAE model, the input variables were mapped into another feature space, where the AGB can be accurately predicted. The overcomplete sparse features were derived due to the sparsity in the hidden layer, and the deep learning features were more representative because of stacked layers of neural networks. In future research, the SSAE modeling should be applied separately for different forest types to improve AGB estimation accuracy. Additionally, the RF algorithm achieved more outstanding predictive accuracy than other models besides SSAE, and its satisfactory performance has been demonstrated in previous studies [35,53,54]. The relatively outstanding performance of the RF model depends on its distinctive regression technique and conceptual design which results in the robustness and flexibility with respect to noise and outliers [65]. It should be noted that RF may not work effectively using a small amount of samples on account of the employment of a soft linear boundaries combination [66]. In the study, the prediction accuracy of SVR was worse than that of RF. This result may be attributed to the “noise” variables which might bias the optimal hyperplane in the SVR and thus weaken the model performance. In all the data scenarios, the results show that the SVR achieved a higher accuracy than the KNN. SVR was more powerful at dealing with high-dimensional and nonlinear problems than KNN, which has been suggested by previous studies [35,53]. Besides, the relatively poor performance of KNN might be related to the lack of an effective procedure to weight the prediction strength of the variables in the implementation process of KNN. In the majority of cases, MLSR performed slightly worse than the other tested methods possibly due to its inherent limitations, e.g., the modeling accuracy no longer changes when additional variables are added [67] because not all variables are linearly correlated with biomass.", 5. Discussion , 5.2. Biomass Estimation Using Different Prediction Models,5
1251,"The biomass prediction result of the SSAE model with inputs of ACOLI1, AO and AL integrated variables (R2 = 0.935, RMSE = 15.67 Mg/ha, RMSEr = 11.407%) in our study showed a high accuracy comparable to or better than other similar studies. Li et al. [62] integrated airborne LiDAR with satellite GF-1 data for estimating maize AGB during peak growing season with an R2 of 0.69 and RMSEr of 39%. Kulawardhana et al. [32] evaluated the performance of data fusion based on LiDAR metrics and multispectral vegetation indices using multiple regression models for vegetation AGB estimation with an RMSEr of 25.9%. Fassnacht et al. [35] investigated the potential of hyperspectral and airborne LiDAR integrated dataset for forest biomass estimation with a mean R2 of 0.72 and RMSEr of 28.46%. In Laurin et al. [61], the Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) with inputs of the combined airborne LiDAR metrics and hyperspectral bands achieved the best performance (R2 = 0.7, RMSEr = 35.83%) for the forest biomass estimation. There is the possibility of improving model accuracy in some effective ways. For example, the methods to select the predictor variables should be introduced, and separate estimates for different forest types should be implemented to further improve the AGB prediction performance in future studies.", 5. Discussion , 5.3. Overall Performance of the Biomass Estimation,5
1252,"In this research, univariate regression models using combined optical and LiDAR indices (i.e., COLI1 and COLI2) significantly improved the biomass estimation accuracy compared to those using either data type alone. Therefore, the proposed COLIs provide an avenue to synergistically use optical and LiDAR data for mapping biomass and other vegetation parameters. However, these COLIs should be expanded to other forest types for further validations and wide applications. In addition, it should be noted that the presented results are the first step towards the integration of remotely sensed spatial and spectral information for a precise and non-destructive estimation of forest biomass. Other data fusion methods may further increase the prediction power. The deep learning model (i.e., SSAE), which has previously been rarely explored in mapping forest attributes, was found to be superior over other prediction models for estimating forest AGB. This conclusion may facilitate further applications of deep learning models for mapping vegetation structure parameters. The SSAE prediction model calibrated by variables of ACOLI1, AO and AL yielded the best biomass estimation accuracy. Overall, the deep learning model with inputs of structural and spectral integrated information can become a powerful tool for applications in precision forest biomass monitoring.", 6. Conclusions ,None,6
1253,"Forests are considered one of the biomes on the Earth’s land surface and include the most heterogeneous ecosystems around the globe. The area covered by primary forests has dramatically decreased since 1990 by more than 80 million hectares, whereas other areas of more than 100 million hectares are affected by issues such as wildfires, pests, invasive species and adverse extreme events that result in a decline in biodiversity [1]. Biodiversity conservation needs forest management based on guidelines that include the maintenance and monitoring of ecosystem connectivity, landscape heterogeneity and forest stand structural complexity [2]. Key elements for forest management include preserving protected and production areas, taking into consideration the spatial and temporal handling of harvest units, fire management and how these procedures affect forest structure and species composition [2,3]. In addition, silvicultural systems under climatic change have consequences on production, biodiversity and protection against natural hazards, resulting in a need for improved alternative scenarios for management [2,4].In this context, improved forest management needs spatial and temporal monitoring systems, using remote sensing data to gather timely information and reduce costs [5]. Individual tree detection (ITC) is a key process that enables the automatic detection of changes in critical indicators and supports the actions to minimize their potential impact [6].One of the most common technologies used for this purpose is laser scanning (LS), which is an active remote sensing technology that provides distance measurements between the observer (such as an aircraft or ground-based) and the surface illuminated by the laser beam [7,8]. The multiple benefits obtained with these systems have led to the rapid application of airborne laser scanning (ALS) to forest inventory [9].However, laser scanning is still insufficiently applied for some purposes, due to the inadequate individual tree segmentation capability offered by LiDAR technology, caused by the complex patterns of forest canopies (giving significant omission and commission errors frequently) [10]. A segmentation process can be understood as a process for identifying and grouping objects based on statistical similarities or similar features in data [11]. Segmentation in 2D remote sensing data has been used since long ago [12], and there are many methods based on pixel, edge, region and graph identification for image analysis [13,14].In addition, there are individual tree segmentation methods based on canopy estimation that were implemented for 3D LiDAR data obtained by ALS [15,16,17]. The application of these methods to point clouds collected by terrestrial laser scanners (TLS) often fails due to the lack of good point densities at the top-canopy surface. The occlusion effect still limits the processing efficiency to extract forest attributes [18], making it difficult to identify the tree top and other useful features to obtain a proper segmentation result [19]. Consequently, the classification method strongly depends on the data acquisition source [20].Clustering methods in tree segmentation of TLS data have been widely used [21,22,23,24]. However, the method presented here shows a new individual tree extraction procedure based on an iterative DBSCAN clustering analysis of cylinder voxelizations that can be applied in any forest context. The basics of this algorithm relies on the trunk identification; therefore, the wider and more separated the trunks are in the point cloud acquired, the better the quality of the segmentations will be. Nevertheless, in the last section, a sensibility study of the different input parameters will be made in order to exploit the potential of the method presented here.The objective of this work consists of a IT segmentation method based on TLS data collected by using a backpack mobile system. This paper is organized as follows: the next section illustrates the instrumental equipment used, the study area and the methodology of the segmentation algorithm, and Section 3 reports the experimental results and a discussion of their significance. The last section includes the main conclusions of the work along with future work.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
1254,"In this study, a ZEB-GO handheld laser scanner (view Figure 1) is used for the data acquisition. The technical specifications of this system are shown in Table 1.The ZEB-GO handheld system consists of a 2D laser scanner (class 1 laser of 905 nm wavelength), combined with an inertial measurement unit (IMU). These are both mounted on top of a spring, itself mounted on a hand grip [25]. The laser specifications cite a 

≤
30

 m measurement range, but this is unlikely to be achieved outdoors (due to ambient solar radiation) [18]; a survey swath of up to 15–20 m around the instrument is more realistic [18,26]. The hand-held part of the scanner (0.85 kg) is linked to a data logger carried in a backpack. As the user carries the ZEB-GO and walks through the environment, the scanner head swings back and forth, creating a 3D scanning field with data being captured at the speed of movement. The scanner is a time-of-flight (TOF) laser with a rate of 43,000 points/s and a field of view of 270

 horizontally and approximately 120


∘

 vertically. No additional information about the intensity of the returned signal is collected.This system includes a backpack system that can automatically collect and register data that are hard to access via standard GPS technologies, such as in underground cavities [27,28] or indoor buildings [29]. Due to the fact that under-canopy forests are considered GPS-denied areas, the TLS obtains its position and orientation based on IMU information and the LiDAR data collected by a Hokuyo system. A simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach supports the accurate mapping of the forest. The concept of SLAM is that a robot can be placed in an unknown environment and has the ability to create a map and then navigate to a particular destination [30]. The fact that the ZEB-GO is lightweight (850 g) and has no reliance on GPS makes it an ideal data capture method for inaccessible areas, such as under tree canopies and indoors [30,31], as shown in the right panel of Figure 1.The motion created when the operator walked through the forest is an important part of the measurement technique [32], so a walking survey path between all possible trees in the region of study was followed in order to minimize occluded areas, as done in [18,32,33], based on the results of [33].", 2.

1256,"After the surveying is conducted, a raw point cloud of the plot is obtained from the TLS. In order to obtain the IT location from this raw point cloud, the methodology consists of a sequence of four steps, as follows: (i) outlier filter based on the trajectory of the handheld TLS, (ii) trunk layer subtraction, (iii) cylinder voxelization and clustering, and (iv) merging of floating segments and noise filtering. This workflow is schematically shown in Figure 3. 2.3.1. Outlier FilterThe main purpose of the outlier filter is to erase those points in the raw point cloud that lie out of the plot to be considered. This points belong to branches, trunks or shrubs that are considered noise.Since the outliers are collected near the limit of the LS range (in our case, ∼30 m of diameter), a direct gate filter is applied to the raw point cloud, taking into account the trajectory of the TLS as a reference. A polygon is derived from the convex hull of the trajectory, filtering all points outside the polygon beyond a distance threshold (Figure 4).After this transformation, the resulting point cloud is normalized with respect to the digital terrain model (DTM). Point cloud normalization is applied following the procedure presented in [36].A morphological filter is applied to separate ground points from non-ground points using dilation and erosion operations to the height profile [37]. The resulting ground points are interpolated by inverse distance weighting (IDW) and meshed to obtain the DTM layer. Finally, using the DTM layer, the point heights are normalized.Figure 5 shows the original raw point cloud and the normalized point cloud after outlier filtering and height normalization. 2.3.2. Trunk Layer SubtractionAfter normalization, the point cloud includes vegetation points, such as shrubs, tree trunks and tree crowns. The first step for an individual tree detection in this method consists of creating a virtual horizontal layer at a certain height that is labeled as the trunk layer. After this layer is defined, we label those points belonging to the layer as trunk points, as shown in Figure 6. Depending on the height of the trunk layer, there might be a shrub or low crown points mislabeled as trunk points.In order to filter these points as trunk candidates, a clustering analysis of the trunk points is carried out based on the DBSCAN algorithm [17]. The corresponding result for the trunk layer clustering analysis is shown in Figure 7.DBSCAN clustering analysis is defined by three input parameters: the whole point cloud set, a point-neighboring radius 
ϵ
 and the minimal points per cluster,

 as the DBSCAN radius for the trunk cluster identification. As described in the following section, a sensibility assessment of the parameters is carried out to obtain the optimal parameters for the DBSCAN clustering analysis of the point cloud.After clustering, we finally calculate the centroid for each i trunk in the XY plane, thus obtaining an estimation for the tree locations. For this, as shown in Figure 8, we set the same statistical weight for all n points in the trunk cluster and compute its center of mass as follows:

is the total mass of the cluster. Thus, we have a continuous mass distribution, the center of mass being the same as the geometrical center of the total volume [38].However, in the case of two close trunks, if the

 used is big enough, both trunks are considered as only one, leading to a wrong tree identification. This example can be seen in Figure 8b, where two trunks are close and the DBSCAN clustering merged them in one cluster. This phenomenon is mainly responsible for the omission errors (

) during the algorithm development; a discussion about this fact is made in the last sections.Additionally, points of the ZEB-GO slice appear to be within and outside the stem, and the density of points around the trunk follows a Gaussian shape with a model located in the outline of the cross section [18] (Figure 8). This is an important factor to take into account for making a proper noise filtering. 2.3.3. Cylinder VoxelizationCylinder voxelization supports the segmentation of the point cloud in clusters belonging to the same tree.Once the trunk centroid estimations (i.e., the tree locations) are obtained, the closest neighbor of each trunk is derived. The distance between a trunk and its closest neighbor is defined as the candidate radius of the cylinder to be analyzed for segmentation.Considering the trunk centroid as the center, an infinite cylinder with the candidate radius is calculated. All the points inside this cylinder are accordingly labeled as cylinder points and segmented as 

C

 point cloud. For each cylinder point cloud

, a new DBSCAN clustering analysis is performed. In this DBSCAN procedure, analogous to the trunk layer subtraction step, we define the neighbor DBSCAN radius as the

, and low values for it are expected in order to reject the points of the surrounding tree crowns (it is preferably to have some small-sized clusters instead of only one big cluster because the next step consists of merging all of the subclusters, following the constraint that not all subclusters in a cylinder voxelization belong to the same tree). As a result, it is likely to obtain an oversegmentation with j subclusters

 inside the candidate cylinder-points in

 instead of only one subcluster. An example of a cylinder point cloud and its DBSCAN subclustering can be seen in Figure 9, where a small value of

 is set in order to have many subclusters in one cylinder voxelization.This is an iterative process, where all the candidate cylinder-points are filtered and not considered in the next iteration, in order to save the computational resources. The process is stopped when there are no pending trunks to label. Points that do not belong to any of the cylinders are labeled as discarded points in the cylinder voxelization. 2.3.4. Merging the Floating Segments and Noise FilteringAfter cylinder voxelization and subclustering, two types of clusters are expected: ground-connected and floating segments as shown in the right panel of Figure 9. In order to label the subclusters, the vertical continuity is assessed by comparing their point density at different heights. In the case that a discontinuity is detected between the ground and the candidate subcluster 

C
i
j

, the candidate subcluster is labeled as a floating segment. Otherwise, the candidate subcluster is labeled as being ground-connected.For the aerial LiDAR data acquired, this would lead to an incorrect performance, due to the low point density under the tree crowns, showing trees with few trunk points. However, in our case, as the algorithm is developed for terrestrial LiDAR, this issue is completely avoided, and for a real tree, there will be always at least one segment very close to the ground that is considered ground-connected.Once all subclusters are classified, merging the floating segments consists of assigning them to the closest ground-connected segment. In Figure 10, there is an example of the point cloud’s state before and after this process. In the left panel, there are some groups of points that do not seem to match their correspondent tree, i.e., the floating segments, so after identifying them by evaluating their vertical continuity, they are merged with the closest ground-connected segment. After repeating this process with all cylinder point clouds, there will be a remaining group of points without any classification yet. We will call them discarded points, and their analysis will be the last step of the algorithm’s procedure.To finish, the discarded points in the cylinder voxelization are studied. In the trunk layer subtraction step, all trunks are identified by DBSCAN clustering providing the location of all trees and, then, for each i trunk (with gravity center

) the closest j trunk cluster (with gravity center

with N being the number of total segments identified. However, the whole point cloud set C can be greater than the union of all

 individual tree sets because some points are discarded during the voxelization step. As shown in Figure 11, the red cylinders union overlaps only points close by their original tree, even if some points were not associated yet and, thus, did not belong to any cylinder voxelization.

 varies for each forest because it is related to the proximity of the trees, so establishing an optimal value for it is different for every datum acquired.

) during the algorithm development; a discussion about this fact is made in the last sections.Additionally, points of the ZEB-GO slice appear to be within and outside the stem, and the density of points around the trunk follows a Gaussian shape with a model located in the outline of the cross section [18] (Figure 8). This is an important factor to take into account for making a proper noise filtering.", 2. Materials and Methods, 2.3.2. Trunk Layer Subtraction,2
1259,"Cylinder voxelization supports the segmentation of the point cloud in clusters belonging to the same tree.Once the trunk centroid estimations (i.e., the tree locations) are obtained, the closest neighbor of each trunk is derived. The distance between a trunk and its closest neighbor is defined as the candidate radius of the cylinder to be analyzed for segmentation.Considering the trunk centroid as the center, an infinite cylinder with the candidate radius is calculated. All the points inside this cylinder are accordingly labeled as cylinder points and segmented as

1260,"After cylinder voxelization and subclustering, two types of clusters are expected: ground-connected and floating segments as shown in the right panel of Figure 9. In order to label the subclusters, the vertical continuity is assessed by comparing their point density at different heights. In the case that a discontinuity is detected between the ground and the candidate subcluster 

C
i
j

, the candidate subcluster is labeled as a floating segment. Otherwise, the candidate subcluster is labeled as being ground-connected.For the aerial LiDAR data acquired, this would lead to an incorrect performance, due to the low point density under the tree crowns, showing trees with few trunk points. However, in our case, as the algorithm is developed for terrestrial LiDAR, this issue is completely avoided, and for a real tree, there will be always at least one segment very close to the ground that is considered ground-connected.Once all subclusters are classified, merging the floating segments consists of assigning them to the closest ground-connected segment. In Figure 10, there is an example of the point cloud’s state before and after this process. In the left panel, there are some groups of points that do not seem to match their correspondent tree, i.e., the floating segments, so after identifying them by evaluating their vertical continuity, they are merged with the closest ground-connected segment. After repeating this process with all cylinder point clouds, there will be a remaining group of points without any classification yet. We will call them discarded points, and their analysis will be the last step of the algorithm’s procedure.To finish, the discarded points in the cylinder voxelization are studied. In the trunk layer subtraction step, all trunks are identified by DBSCAN clustering providing the location of all trees and, then, for each i trunk (with gravity center

1261,"The validation consists of defining and applying the metrics to obtain the performance of the method. The metrics found in the literature for ALS processing [10,39,40,41,42] are not applicable to our methodology because of the different point of view of the TLS. Specifically, the tree top or the maximum canopy width are not parameters of interest in our case. In order to measure the performance of the segmentation, we consider the segments as true positives (TP), false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP) based on the following iterative process.First, we subtract all trees in the processed point cloud by hand and, for each manually segmented tree, a centroid of its trunk in the XY plane is computed following the same logic as in Section 2.3.2. Those centroids are considered to be each true tree location. Once all real trees are identified, the iterative validation process starts.For each manually subtracted tree, the closest tree is searched and the distance between them is defined as 

d

m

On the other hand, commission errors are the opposite; they appear when an algorithm segment is classified as a real tree when it should not be. As mentioned in Section 2.3.2, making a good identification of each tree trunk and, then, of each real tree minimizes the omission error. The floating segments merging step is a good procedure for minimizing the commission error because most of the floating segments that could be identified as a real tree are combined with the closest ground-connected tree (that would be a real tree because it has a trunk), and this fact leads to a small commission error.Summarizing, DBSCAN parameters, such as

1262,"As previously mentioned, the region of study was in O Xurés (Galicia, Spain), and the point clouds consist of ∼3 million points. We implemented the methodology in a Python script [43] with Open3D library for 3D data processing [44] to extract IT with both qualitative and quantitative good results. Processing times of the program were timely consistent for the point cloud taken (in the range of 3–8 min), in comparison with other similar methods such as those in [24,45,46,47], where times were in the order of 2 days, 6.22 min, 4 min and 4.78 min, respectively. In addition, the times of processing in this work can be improved by varying the input parameters given. Some examples are shown in Figure 13, Figure 14 and Figure 15.", 3. Results and Discussions, 3.1. Segmentation of Backpack Point Clouds,3
1263,"To validate this algorithm, we select one of the point clouds of O Xurés and segmented it by hand. This is important to test how many trees were effectively identified. Once the point cloud is manually segmented, each tree position is located by iterating over all manual segments and calculating the centroid of the points at the beginning of each trunk. The location of the segmented trees is evaluated, following the metric explained in the methodology, labeling each tree as TP, FP or FN. When a segment is considered a TP, we mark it as a matched tree, as shown in the left panel of Figure 16. In addition, a scattering plot of the deviation of each segment from its actual tree is shown in the right panel of Figure 16, showing low errors in the identification process. There are also some matched trees with location errors over 1 m, but this is because some segments are considered TP when they overlap parts of their closest trees, creating the trunk centroid far from its real location. The tree is regarded as a TP because it is effectively detected, but the subtracted tree location contributes to make scatter errors in plot (b) of Figure 16.Equations (3)–(5) help to achieve the best input parameters for the segmentation algorithm. These input parameters are those used during the algorithm’s development: the DBSCAN radius of the trunk identification (

∼

 cm). However, this situation is challenging, even for a human practitioner.Another example is the canopy segmentation task: if there is more than one tree with nearby canopies, it will be difficult to identify which points belong to each tree.

1264,"Forest inventory from airborne laser scanning (ALS) has had a rapid application due to the feasibility of the path followed by an aerial vehicle. However, laser scanning can be a hard task for places where these instruments have difficulties in their flights, creating a lack of information in regions where the occlusion is big enough. In the literature, terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) is shown to be useful for accessing the under-canopy region but with low point density at the canopy surface.Taking into account these facts from ALS and TLS data, some computational methods were developed in order to extract forest features, such as individual tree shapes or tree locations. Nevertheless, almost all methods are designed for specific types of measurement sources, making some algorithms work better with aerial or terrestrial LiDAR data.The aim of this work consists of segmentation of individual trees (IT) from raw point clouds obtained by a backpack TLS in the Spanish region of O Xurés, Galicia, Spain. For this purpose, a segmentation algorithm was designed and successfully applied, leading high detection rates.The method proposed needs a normalized point cloud as input data and provides the same cloud with all their points labeled with the IT they belong to. As shown in the previous section, the results obtained are good enough to show that this technology is useful for inventory tasks in forests, achieving detection rates near

 and low commission and omission errors.For the study area, the variation of the DBSCAN parameters and threshold distances was studied in order to minimize the omission and commission errors. One way to improve the detection rate is the implementation of a convolutionary neural network (CNN). Training this CNN with the individual tree segments of the backpack LiDAR data will lead to a more sophisticated and complex model that may reduce the computational calculus time. In addition, this network can help in the generation of a dataset by creating artificial trees point clouds by data augmentation.Despite the obstacles mentioned in the validation assessment, the algorithm developed showed good results with undergrowth and completely wild nature environments, which is the basis for IT-level forest management.

1265,"As a key component of the global carbon cycle, the terrestrial gross primary production (GPP) in forests plays an important role in the global carbon, water, and energy cycles [1,2,3]. GPP is the amount of illumination energy from the sun that is transformed into biomass energy, and is dependent on the illumination, heat, and water in terrestrial ecosystems [4,5]. Precisely estimating GPP is essential for evaluating terrestrial carbon cycles, which also influence climate change [6]. Approximately 40% of GPP is directly or indirectly used by humans [7]. Vegetation is the key component in the ability of humans to adjust the climate and mitigate increasing atmospheric CO2 [8]. Currently, several GPP remote sensing products, such as MPI-BGC [9], MODIS [10], JULES [11,12], BESS [13], and BEPS [14,15], which estimate GPP over large regions, exhibit different estimation accuracies for different vegetation types.Forest ecosystems cover more than 30% of the land surface and represent 80% of the aboveground biomass on Earth [16,17]. In primeval forest ecosystems, the aboveground parts of the forest system can be divided into two components, the overstory and understory. The overstory component is the tree layer that intercepts direct solar radiation. The understory is defined as the vegetation structures under the upper layer of the canopy, and it is mainly composed of species of vegetation that prefer shaded conditions. In tropical and subtropical dense forests, the understory component can be divided into shrub and grass layers, but in temperate forests, this component consists of mostly grasses and herbs [18,19].Both overstory and understory species are important contributors to the carbon uptake in terrestrial ecosystems [20,21]. Some studies have shown that understory vegetation contributes 32% of the total GPP in tropical forests [22,23], but this contribution may be 25% in temperate forests [24]. A recent study showed that the shaded GPP has increased by 1.1% over the past three decades [25]. This variability is due to variations in the light, temperature, and humidity conditions in the understory and overstory. Shaded leaves also have unique characteristics, with understory and overstory vegetation exhibiting different responses to the environment and various photosynthetic traits [26,27,28,29,30]. However, in regions with high biodiversity and a high leaf area index (LAI) values in the forest zone, such as evergreen broadleaf forests (EBF) and artificial forests, the estimation of GPP exhibits high variance [31,32]. Furthermore, GPP estimations by remote sensing methods combined with canopy photosynthesis models do not consider the understory incident radiation, and thus may underestimate the total GPP [33,34,35].In dense forest ecosystems, canopy species show multiple leaf functional traits that are important for GPP estimation. Leaf traits vary greatly among overstory and understory species. When scaling up different leaf traits to whole ecosystems [36,37], the structural parameters of ecosystems are some of the most important controlling factors [38,39]. However, species in the same vertical stratification, such as the tree and grass layers in temperate forests and the trees, shrubs, and grasses in tropical rainforests, have similar living environments, and thus similar leaf traits [40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48].Remote sensing is a useful approach for estimating ecosystem GPP at larger spatial scales [8,49]. In forest sites, many studies have demonstrated that micrometeorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and longwave incident radiation exhibit vertical gradients [50,51,52,53,54]. Moreover, the physiological parameters of vegetation such as chlorophyll contents also exhibit vertical gradients [42,55,56]. However, it is difficult to capture these signals from deep in the canopy. Many scientists have used models and methods to retrieve vertical environmental and physiological parameters such as temperature, humidity, PAR, the fraction of absorbed PAR (FPAR), the LAI, and the light use efficiency (LUE) [57,58,59,60,61,62]. Wu et al. and Kosugi et al. [63,64] also determined the rules of the leaf-scale maximum carboxylation rates (Vcmax25) at different heights. All of these models or methods were developed in specific regions; therefore, it may be difficult to determine the parameters on a global scale. In this article, we introduce three GPP models based on LUE models that are based on the Monteith [65] methods. Monteith’s function is calculated as:

GPP = LUE × PAR × FPAR


(1)

where LUE is the daily LUE, and FPAR is the fraction of the absorbed PAR estimated from the LAI and zenith angle. The daily LUE is calculated by different factors that are used to determine LUEmax, and the numerical exercises have specific input parameters.Different models have various parameterizations of environmental stress for LUE; for example, the vegetation photosynthesis model (VPM; Xiao et al. [66]) assumes that temperature is of low importance to LUE at optimal growing temperatures, but it is of high importance at high (50 °C) and low temperatures (0 °C). The MOD17 (MOD, Running et al. [4,67]) model was designed to use remote sensing data for GPP estimation, and this model utilizes a higher stress factor (less than 10% of the LUE for optimal growth) at low daily minimal temperatures (−8 °C) and a low stress factor (100% of the LUE for optimal growth) at high daily minimal temperatures (9 °C). The model developed by Wu et al. [63] assumed that high temperatures were important for LUE (more detailed information can be found in the Supplementary Material).However, the models mentioned above did not consider the effect of vegetation stratification on the forest canopy. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of vertical stratification on remotely sensed GPP estimations in selected dense forest. We raised the following two questions: (a) how do environmental drivers vary with height in multilayer dense forests; and (b) does adding vertical stratification parameters to remotely sensed GPP algorithms improve the performance of the estimations in forest canopies? To address these questions, we used eddy covariance flux data from two sites, including one EBF and one artificial Japanese larch forest, in three remotely sensed LUE models to evaluate the responses of GPP to different factors during the growing season. These sites have meteorological data measurements at multiple heights combined with vertical stratification information, such as temperature, vapor pressure deficit (VPD), and PAR.", 1. Introduction,None,1.
1266,"In this research, we selected Dinghushan (DHS) and Tomakomai (TMK) as the research areas. Both of these areas have dense forests and a conspicuous vertically stratified vegetation structure during the growing season from April to October. DHS, which is located in a monsoon subtropical forest climate zone in the southeast part of China, has a 15 m-high broadleaved forest canopy, while TMK, which is located in the northeast part of Japan, has a 15 m-high deciduous needle leaf (DNF) canopy. Vertical meteorological and canopy eddy covariance (EC) data were measured at both sites. A certain amount of understory LAI (>0.9 m2/m2) was found in these two sites during the growing season. Two selected sites’ detailed information is showed in Figure 1 and Table 1. 2.1.1. Dinghushan (DHS)The study area in the DHS Nature Reserve (DNR) is located in the west–central part of Guangdong Province in southeast China. This study area is located in a southern subtropical monsoon humid climate; the average annual temperature of the DNR is 21.8 °C, and the mean annual rainfall is 1927 mm. The period from April through September represents the rainy season, and November to January represents the dry season [68,69].The flux tower located in the DNR study area (23°10′ N, 112°32′ E, 240 masl) is surrounded by more than 70% of EBFs, and the remaining proportion is evergreen coniferous forest. The canopy height near the flux tower is approximately 17 m. Vertically, the forest structure can be divided into four layers: two tree layers, one shrub layer, and one herb and grass layer. The dominant species in the canopy layers are Schima superba, Castanopsis chinensis, and Pinus massoniana. Near the flux tower, the LAI values for the tree, shrub, and grass layers were 2.6 m2/m2, 0.26 m2/m2, and 0.92 m2/m2, respectively, on 6 August 2005.The flux tower contained seven levels of meteorology instrumentation for measuring different variables above or within the canopy, such as temperature and humidity, with shielded and aspirated probes (HMP45C, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) at 4 m, 9 m, 15 m, 21 m, 27 m, 31 m, and 36 m, and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) instruments were installed at 36 m, 21 m, 9 m, and 2 m. For the above-canopy heights, the PPFD was measured by an LI190SB quantum sensor (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). An LQS7010-SUN sensor (APOGEE, Logan, UT, USA) was used to measure the PPFD at heights under the overstory layer.At 27 m, an open-path CO2/H2O gas analyzer (model LI-7500, LI-COR Inc.) and a 3D sonic anemometer/thermometer (model CSAT3, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) were installed on the tower at approximately two times the average canopy height (15 m) near the tower. These instruments measure carbon and water flux exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere [70,71]. All of the data were recorded at 30-min intervals. At this site, the LAI values of the different layers were measured every three months from 2004 to 2005. 2.1.2. Tomakomai (TMK)The TMK study area is in the Tomakomai National Forest, which is approximately 15 km northwest of Tomakomai, Hokkaido, in northern Japan. The area of larch forest is approximately 100 ha. From 2001–2003, the average temperature was 6.5 °C, and the site was warm in summer and snowy in winter. The mean annual rainfall was 1055 mm. The growing season extends from April to October, while there is little vegetation cover in other months.The flux tower was located in the center of the larch forest (42°44′13.1″ N, 141°31′7.1″ E, 115 masl), and the surrounding trees were approximately 45 years old at the time of this study. The height of the vegetation canopy was 18 m in 2003. The dominant species near the tower were classified as either overstory or understory species. The overstory species included Japanese larch, birch, spruce, and Japanese elm, and the understory species were ferns and other herbs. The LAI values near the flux tower in the overstory and understory layers were 5.4 m2/m2 and 3 m2/m2, respectively, in August 2005 [72].The flux tower contained eight levels of meteorology instrumentation for measuring different variables such as temperature and humidity above and within the canopy, which were measured with a platinum resistance thermometer and a capacitive hygrometer (HMP-45D, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) at 2 m, 5 m, 8 m, 14 m, 18 m, 22 m, 27 m, and 40 m. The PPFD was measured at 2 m, 5 m, 14 m, 18 m, and 40 m by a quantum sensor (LI-190S, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) in the tower and on the forest floor. At 27 m, the CO2 flux between this ecosystem and the atmosphere was measured by open and closed-path EC instruments (LI-7500 and LI-6262, LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA).

1267,"The study area in the DHS Nature Reserve (DNR) is located in the west–central part of Guangdong Province in southeast China. This study area is located in a southern subtropical monsoon humid climate; the average annual temperature of the DNR is 21.8 °C, and the mean annual rainfall is 1927 mm. The period from April through September represents the rainy season, and November to January represents the dry season [68,69].The flux tower located in the DNR study area (23°10′ N, 112°32′ E, 240 masl) is surrounded by more than 70% of EBFs, and the remaining proportion is evergreen coniferous forest. The canopy height near the flux tower is approximately 17 m. Vertically, the forest structure can be divided into four layers: two tree layers, one shrub layer, and one herb and grass layer. The dominant species in the canopy layers are Schima superba, Castanopsis chinensis, and Pinus massoniana. Near the flux tower, the LAI values for the tree, shrub, and grass layers were 2.6 m2/m2, 0.26 m2/m2, and 0.92 m2/m2, respectively, on 6 August 2005.The flux tower contained seven levels of meteorology instrumentation for measuring different variables above or within the canopy, such as temperature and humidity, with shielded and aspirated probes (HMP45C, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) at 4 m, 9 m, 15 m, 21 m, 27 m, 31 m, and 36 m, and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD) instruments were installed at 36 m, 21 m, 9 m, and 2 m. For the above-canopy heights, the PPFD was measured by an LI190SB quantum sensor (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). An LQS7010-SUN sensor (APOGEE, Logan, UT, USA) was used to measure the PPFD at heights under the overstory layer.At 27 m, an open-path CO2/H2O gas analyzer (model LI-7500, LI-COR Inc.) and a 3D sonic anemometer/thermometer (model CSAT3, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT, USA) were installed on the tower at approximately two times the average canopy height (15 m) near the tower. These instruments measure carbon and water flux exchange between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere [70,71]. All of the data were recorded at 30-min intervals.

1268,"The TMK study area is in the Tomakomai National Forest, which is approximately 15 km northwest of Tomakomai, Hokkaido, in northern Japan. The area of larch forest is approximately 100 ha. From 2001–2003, the average temperature was 6.5 °C, and the site was warm in summer and snowy in winter. The mean annual rainfall was 1055 mm. The growing season extends from April to October, while there is little vegetation cover in other months.The flux tower was located in the center of the larch forest (42°44′13.1″ N, 141°31′7.1″ E, 115 masl), and the surrounding trees were approximately 45 years old at the time of this study. The height of the vegetation canopy was 18 m in 2003. The dominant species near the tower were classified as either overstory or understory species. The overstory species included Japanese larch, birch, spruce, and Japanese elm, and the understory species were ferns and other herbs. The LAI values near the flux tower in the overstory and understory layers were 5.4 m2/m2 and 3 m2/m2, respectively, in August 2005 [72].The flux tower contained eight levels of meteorology instrumentation for measuring different variables such as temperature and humidity above and within the canopy, which were measured with a platinum resistance thermometer and a capacitive hygrometer (HMP-45D, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) at 2 m, 5 m, 8 m, 14 m, 18 m, 22 m, 27 m, and 40 m.

The net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in these two sites included exchange items (Fc) and storage items (Fs), so these values would be more accurate at these two sites under high LAI.In this article, we converted the FLUXNET2015 flux GPP data at DHS and the gap-filled Asia Flux NEE at TMK to GPP using the flux analysis tool [74]. After obtaining the quality-controlled NEE, we partitioned the NEE into GPP and RE. For unreliable data, we used the harmonic analysis of time series (HANTS) algorithm [75] to gap-fill the GPP data at 30-min intervals. The 30-min GPP data were excluded when the solar radiation in the PPFD was less than 10 µmol/m2/s.

GPP = FPAR × PAR × LUEmax × f(T) × g(VPD)

1274,"In situ meteorology data for the height of each sub-ecosystem are available for the DHS and TMK sites. Thus, the GPP of every sub-ecosystem can be described by the GPP model with the meteorology data and model parameters from each height. In this research, we assumed that each sub-ecosystem would have a different LUEi, which is defined as the LUE of the sub-ecosystem. LUEi is affected by only certain environmental factors, such as temperature and the VPD at the corresponding height. LUEi was calculated using Equation (4), and the LUEmax of the sub-ecosystems (such as those of shrubs and grasses), temperature, and the VPD stress functions are provided in the Supplementary Material.At the ecosystem scale, using temperature and the VPD scalar produces the LUEmax, which characterizes carbon sequestration from the LUE. Moreover, different vegetation types, such as the tree, shrub, and grass layers, have various LUEmax values. Table 2 presents the various LUEmax inputs for the GPP estimation results from four different articles. The results of Zhou and Madani stated that overstory layers, such as the overstory tree layer, have an average LUEmax of 0.28 gC/m2/MJ, which is higher than the LUE of the understory layer (grass).To analyze the effect of vertical structure on GPP estimation, we calculated GPP considering vertical layers using the following function:

where GPPm is defined as the modeled sum of GPP in two (overstory and understory) or three (tree, shrub, and grass) sub-ecosystems. The ecosystems were divided into overstory and understory groups at TMK and into tree, shrub, and grass groups at DHS using in situ LAI measurements. The meteorology data can provide in situ air temperature and VPD stress values for each sub-ecosystem. Temperature sensors at different heights measured the air temperature, while the VPD was calculated from the relationship between VPD and both temperature and humidity [77,78]. APARi is the absorbed PAR for the LUE of a specified height, and was calculated from FPAR and PAR. At the DHS site, the whole ecosystem can be divided into three sub-ecosystems, namely, the tree, shrub, and grass layers; thus, the GPP was calculated for the EBF, shrub, and grass layers (sub-ecosystems) using the in situ temperature, VPD, PAR, and long-term LAI data for each layer, and specific LUEmax input values for each sub-ecosystem. At the TMK site, we divided the ecosystem into DNF and grass sub-ecosystems, and used the GPP input parameters for each layer, as used in the approach for DHS:

GPPs represents the GPP of a specific ecosystem that was estimated using the big-leaf model, which assumes that the entire ecosystem is a single leaf. At the DHS site, the LUE was calculated as an EBF ecosystem with an EBF-based LUEmax (Table 3), and the temperature and VPD stress were given by the mean canopy temperature and VPD. At TMK, the DNF-based LUEmax (Table 3) was used, and the temperature and VPD stress were given by the mean canopy temperature and VPD.

The GPP bias (GPPdif in Equation (7)) is the multilayer GPP result (GPPm) minus the single-layer GPP result (GPPs), which represents the difference between the two models. Therefore, GPPdif is the difference between considering and not considering vertical stratification. TMK and DHS have overstory and understory vegetation, so using representative GPPs for the whole canopy would lead to estimation uncertainties. The modeled GPP values produced by a variety of models were given their own terms. For example, if a GPP result was produced without considering the vertical structure in a VPM, this value was represented as GPP_s_VPM. If a GPP result was produced based on a MODIS model that considered the vertical structure, it was represented as GPP_m_MOD.", 3. Methods, 3.2. GPP Estimation Considering the Vertical Structure,3
1275,"In this study, we also compared the measured PAR and modeled PAR values to simulate PAR in the vertical direction.

1276,"At the same time, the maximal air temperature in the canopy was usually found at the top of the canopy, while the minimal value was often found at the ground layer. We evaluated the largest variance in the vertical temperature and VPD profiles using two parameters: Tdif and VPDdif. Tdif is defined as the air temperature at the top of the canopy minus the temperature at the grass layer. VPDdif is the VPD of the top layer of the canopy minus the VPD of the grass layer.", 3.

1277,"In forest canopies, vertical temperature and VPD stratification vary with forest type and season. Figure 2A,B show the differences in the daily average vertical temperature from day of year (DOY) 210 to 365 at the DHS site (EBF) in 2005, and from DOY 182 to 365 in 2003 at the TMK site (DNF).Variances in air temperature occur in forest canopies during the growing season. In most cases, the air temperature in the tree layer is higher than that in the grass layer, with an average temperature difference of approximately 0.4 °C at the DHS site. In the DNF vegetation type at the TMK site, the mean temperature difference was approximately 0 °C before DOY 240. From DOY 240 to 280, the temperature of the tree layer was 0.5 °C higher than that of the grass layer. However, during the non-growing season after DOY 290, the temperature differences of the forest layer ranged from 0.5 °C to 1.5 °C, which means that the temperatures in the tree layer were higher than those in the grass layer.Similarly, the VPD of the tree layer in the forest canopy was higher than that of the grass layer. VPD varies with air temperature. During the summer to autumn period (DOY 180 to 300), the daily average VPD of the tree layer was approximately 120 Pa higher than that of the grass layer at the DHS site, and approximately 70 Pa higher than that at the TMK site. With the decrease in temperature during the winter period (DOY 300 to 365), the VPD of the tree layer was 50 Pa higher than that of the grass layer at the DHS site, and 25 Pa higher than that at the TMK site, which was not as great as the difference during the summer period. Figure 2B,D shows that Tdif and VPDdif have a robust linear relationship in months during the growing season.In a forest canopy, overstory incident PAR is much higher than that in the understory layer because the incident energy in the understory is affected by sky conditions and the overstory forest structure parameters. At the TMK site, the understory incident PAR was approximately 10% of the overstory incident PAR during the growing season when the LAI of the overstory was high (LAI = 5). However, when the overstory LAI was low during the winter period (DOY 300 to 365), the understory incident PAR was 30% of the overstory incident energy (Figure 3A). However, in EBFs such as those at the DHS site, the overstory LAI did not intensely change throughout the year. Figure 3B shows that the incident PAR of the shrub layer at the DHS site was 40% that of the tree layer, and the incident PAR of the grass layer was 20% that of the tree layer. After DOY 250, the incident PAR of the overstory layer was steadier than that in the summer period (before DOY 250) because there were fewer cloudy days; thus, the incident PAR of the grass layer was approximately 15% that of the overstory layer.The vertical forest structure parameters also influence the amount of understory incident PAR. Table 3 indicates that the total amount of incident PAR in the understory layer was underestimated by 2% to 3% at these two sites.", 4. Results and Analysis, 4.1.

1278,"Two main factors determine the estimation of GPP in LUE models: (1) the influences of temperature, VPD, and LUEmax on LUE, and (2) the effects of PAR and LAI on the absorbed shortwave energy in different components of the whole ecosystem. In this study, the major difference between considering and not considering the vertical structure during the GPP estimation is the difference between the overstory and understory LUE and APAR. 4.2.1. LUE in Different Sub-Ecosystems Is Influenced by the Vertical Stratification of Temperature, VPD, and LUEmaxVertical variations in temperature, VPD, and the LUEmax of sub-ecosystems led to differences in LUE at various forest canopy heights. Some studies have shown that the vegetation in the understory layer such as grass has a lower LUEmax. In addition, the vertical differences in temperature and VPD led to variations during different periods of the year. Figure 4 shows the modeled LUE, which combined the vertical variations in temperature and VPD in the sub-ecosystems. At the DHS site, high layers in the canopy, such as the tree and shrub layers, had LUEs that were 0.3 gC/MJ to 0.6 gC/MJ lower than those of understory layers, such as grass layers, throughout the study period. Prior to DOY 320, the LUE of the shrub layer was 0.1 gC/MJ lower than that of the tree layer. After DOY 330, the LUEs of the shrub layer and the tree layer were almost the same. Similarly, the understory LUE at TMK was approximately 0.4 gC/MJ higher than that of the overstory layer throughout the growing season (DOY 210 to 300).The mean canopy air temperature influenced the estimation of GPP. The trend in GPPdif in Figure 5 shows that with decreasing canopy mean temperature, the estimation based on GPPm becomes much lower than that based on GPPs, and with increasing mean temperature, the estimation based on GPPm becomes larger than that based on GPPs. The estimates of the three models are similar: GPPdif reaches 0 at approximately 16 °C. The optimal growing temperatures of different species in one sub-ecosystem, such as the tree layer, would not exhibit much variance. When the mean canopy temperature reaches approximately 16 °C, the grass ecosystem reaches its optimal growing temperature, and the LUE of grass would be 10% higher than that at 10 °C or lower. At the same time, the LAI of the understory increases with increasing temperature, and the grass understory has a higher photosynthetic ability. This situation causes the value of GPPm to be higher than that of GPPs.The canopy vertical VPD stratification has a pattern that is similar to that of the canopy vertical temperature stratification: there are variations in photosynthesis in the vertical layers that lead to GPP estimation bias. Figure 6 shows that the GPPdif values are completely different at the DHS and TMK sites. The trend of the change in GPPdif in Figure 6B shows that the estimation from GPPm becomes much lower than that from GPPs as the mean canopy VPD decreases, and with an increase in the mean VPD, the estimation from GPPm becomes larger than that from GPPs. At the DHS site, the GPPdif varied nonsignificantly from approximately −5% to 5%. GPPdif declines with increasing canopy mean VPD, which is opposite the pattern observed at the TMK site, where GPPdif increases with VPD, because the VPD increases from 0 to a higher value at the DHS site. When the VPD is greater than 0, the photosynthetic capacities of different vegetation components, including the tree, shrub, and grass layers decrease, and the total GPP declines. GPPdif changes from −50% to 30% when the mean canopy VPD increases from approximately 0 Pa to 500 Pa at the TMK site. 4.2.2. Vertical Stratification of APAR Influenced GPP Estimation by the Multilayer ModelForest structure parameters such as LAI influenced the absorption of radiation by the forest canopy, so the total APAR of the forest canopy can be calculated using LAI and incident PAR. In this section, we analyze LAI and incident PAR as influenced by the APAR in different sub-ecosystems and the effect of separate APARs in the sub-ecosystems on GPP modeling.In a natural environment, the variety of vertical LAI distributions leads to different absorbed PAR distributions in the tree, shrub, and grass layers, which have diverse photosynthetic capacities that lead to GPP modeling biases. Figure 7 shows the total GPP in different LAI distributions. We made two assumptions. The first assumption is that the LUE on a daily scale in different layers is the mean value, which is 1.05 gC/m2/MJ in the tree layer, 0.83 gC/m2/MJ in the shrub layer, and 1.47 gC/m2/MJ in the grass layer. These values are the average values of the results of three models considering optimal growing environments. The APAR for each layer is influenced by only the LAI and the total incident PAR in the top layer. The second assumption is that the LUEmax in the shrub layer is lower than that in the tree and grass layers [32]. Similar to the results at the DHS site, when the LAI ratio in the tree, shrub, and grass layers is 2.5:0.6:0.9 (at DOY 249), GPPm is 5% higher than GPPs. At the TMK site during the summer, the LAI ratio in the tree and grass layers is 2:1, and GPPm is 15% higher than GPPs. As in the shrub and grass layers, the understory LAI would thus be the most important factor for GPPdif, and its ratio to total LAI leads to a range of −40% to 25% for the GPP estimation uncertainties.Incident PAR in the forest canopy also determined the GPP modeling difference whether or not vertical stratification was considered. Figure 8A,C show that considering the effect of vertical stratification on GPP leads to results that are similar to the GPP values that are measured by the flux towers because understory species such as shrubs and grasses have high photosynthetic capacities despite receiving little incident PAR [82]. When the incident PAR of the top of the canopy is lower than 175 W/m2 at these two sites, the value of the flux tower-based GPP is 1–2 gC/m2 lower than GPP, and is closer to GPPm than GPPs. When the incident PAR is higher than 175 W/m2, GPPm is 0.5–2 gC/m2 higher than the flux tower-based GPP, which has a lower bias than GPPs.Moreover, at high temperatures at the DHS site, the estimation of GPPm is lower than the estimation of GPPs, and the difference between GPPm and GPPs increases with increasing incident PAR (Figure 8B,D). At the TMK site, the difference between GPPm and GPPs increases with increasing PAR, and reaches a maximum of approximately 70% of GPPs, which is much higher than that at the DHS site. When the incident PAR increases, the PAR reaching the understory also increases. Understory layers have higher LUE values, and GPPm is capable of considering the higher photosynthesis from understory components, which explains why GPPm is higher than GPPs. At the TMK site, GPPm is lower than GPPs when the temperature is low, which is the opposite pattern of that at the DHS site. The high temperatures at the DHS site and the low temperatures at the TMK site represent non-optimal growing temperature conditions, under which the biases between GPPm and flux tower-measured GPP are always lower than those between GPPs and flux tower-measured GPP with different degrees of variation at different sites. When the temperature enters the optimal growing temperature range, the estimation of GPPm is higher than that of GPPs, which considers the high photosynthesis capacity of the understory.", 4. Results and Analysis, 4.2. Influence of Vertical Stratification on GPP Estimation,4
1279,"Vertical variations in temperature, VPD, and the LUEmax of sub-ecosystems led to differences in LUE at various forest canopy heights. Some studies have shown that the vegetation in the understory layer such as grass has a lower LUEmax. In addition, the vertical differences in temperature and VPD led to variations during different periods of the year. Figure 4 shows the modeled LUE, which combined the vertical variations in temperature and VPD in the sub-ecosystems. At the DHS site, high layers in the canopy, such as the tree and shrub layers, had LUEs that were 0.3 gC/MJ to 0.6 gC/MJ lower than those of understory layers, such as grass layers, throughout the study period. Prior to DOY 320, the LUE of the shrub layer was 0.1 gC/MJ lower than that of the tree layer. After DOY 330, the LUEs of the shrub layer and the tree layer were almost the same. Similarly, the understory LUE at TMK was approximately 0.4 gC/MJ higher than that of the overstory layer throughout the growing season (DOY 210 to 300).The mean canopy air temperature influenced the estimation of GPP. The trend in GPPdif in Figure 5 shows that with decreasing canopy mean temperature, the estimation based on GPPm becomes much lower than that based on GPPs, and with increasing mean temperature, the estimation based on GPPm becomes larger than that based on GPPs. The estimates of the three models are similar: GPPdif reaches 0 at approximately 16 °C. The optimal growing temperatures of different species in one sub-ecosystem, such as the tree layer, would not exhibit much variance. When the mean canopy temperature reaches approximately 16 °C, the grass ecosystem reaches its optimal growing temperature, and the LUE of grass would be 10% higher than that at 10 °C or lower. At the same time, the LAI of the understory increases with increasing temperature, and the grass understory has a higher photosynthetic ability. This situation causes the value of GPPm to be higher than that of GPPs.The canopy vertical VPD stratification has a pattern that is similar to that of the canopy vertical temperature stratification: there are variations in photosynthesis in the vertical layers that lead to GPP estimation bias.

1280,"Forest structure parameters such as LAI influenced the absorption of radiation by the forest canopy, so the total APAR of the forest canopy can be calculated using LAI and incident PAR. In this section, we analyze LAI and incident PAR as influenced by the APAR in different sub-ecosystems and the effect of separate APARs in the sub-ecosystems on GPP modeling.In a natural environment, the variety of vertical LAI distributions leads to different absorbed PAR distributions in the tree, shrub, and grass layers, which have diverse photosynthetic capacities that lead to GPP modeling biases. Figure 7 shows the total GPP in different LAI distributions. We made two assumptions. The first assumption is that the LUE on a daily scale in different layers is the mean value, which is 1.05 gC/m2/MJ in the tree layer, 0.83 gC/m2/MJ in the shrub layer, and 1.47 gC/m2/MJ in the grass layer. These values are the average values of the results of three models considering optimal growing environments. The APAR for each layer is influenced by only the LAI and the total incident PAR in the top layer. The second assumption is that the LUEmax in the shrub layer is lower than that in the tree and grass layers [32]. Similar to the results at the DHS site, when the LAI ratio in the tree, shrub, and grass layers is 2.5:0.6:0.9 (at DOY 249), GPPm is 5% higher than GPPs. At the TMK site during the summer, the LAI ratio in the tree and grass layers is 2:1, and GPPm is 15% higher than GPPs. As in the shrub and grass layers, the understory LAI would thus be the most important factor for GPPdif, and its ratio to total LAI leads to a range of −40% to 25% for the GPP estimation uncertainties.Incident PAR in the forest canopy also determined the GPP modeling difference whether or not vertical stratification was considered. Figure 8A,C show that considering the effect of vertical stratification on GPP leads to results that are similar to the GPP values that are measured by the flux towers because understory species such as shrubs and grasses have high photosynthetic capacities despite receiving little incident PAR [82]. When the incident PAR of the top of the canopy is lower than 175 W/m2 at these two sites, the value of the flux tower-based GPP is 1–2 gC/m2 lower than GPP, and is closer to GPPm than GPPs. When the incident PAR is higher than 175 W/m2, GPPm is 0.5–2 gC/m2 higher than the flux tower-based GPP, which has a lower bias than GPPs.Moreover, at high temperatures at the DHS site, the estimation of GPPm is lower than the estimation of GPPs, and the difference between GPPm and GPPs increases with increasing incident PAR (Figure 8B,D). At the TMK site, the difference between GPPm and GPPs increases with increasing PAR, and reaches a maximum of approximately 70% of GPPs, which is much higher than that at the DHS site. When the incident PAR increases, the PAR reaching the understory also increases. Understory layers have higher LUE values, and GPPm is capable of considering the higher photosynthesis from understory components, which explains why GPPm is higher than GPPs. At the TMK site, GPPm is lower than GPPs when the temperature is low, which is the opposite pattern of that at the DHS site. The high temperatures at the DHS site and the low temperatures at the TMK site represent non-optimal growing temperature conditions, under which the biases between GPPm and flux tower-measured GPP are always lower than those between GPPs and flux tower-measured GPP with different degrees of variation at different sites. When the temperature enters the optimal growing temperature range, the estimation of GPPm is higher than that of GPPs, which considers the high photosynthesis capacity of the understory.", 4. Results and Analysis, 4.2.2. Vertical Stratification of APAR Influenced GPP Estimation by the Multilayer Model,4
1281,"Estimating GPP with stratification information in the multilayer GPP model results in higher estimation precision than with the single-layer method (Table 4). Table 4 illustrates that the GPPm estimates at the DHS and TMK sites had higher accuracies than the GPPs estimations, and generally had a lower RMSE (GPPm is 0.2 gC/m2/day lower than GPPs). At the DHS site, the modeled GPP that considered vertical stratification showed a similar correlation when vertical layers were considered, but with the higher LAI of the understory, the R2 value was 2% to 5% higher with GPPm than with GPPs at the TMK site. The low mean bias in the multilayer model (DHS_m and TMK_m) indicates that the multilayer model performs better than the single-layer model.These selected GPP estimation models, including VPM, Wu’s model, and MOD, showed high correlations with the flux tower-based GPP. Wu’s model and the VPM showed higher R2 values than the MOD model at DHS, because they consider scalar temperature at high temperatures. The MOD17 model showed lower RMSE and higher R2 values than both Wu’s model and the VPM at the TMK site, indicating that the MOD model exhibits better performance at that site. The estimation results for the two sites were combined, which indicated that Wu’s model exhibited the best model performance with the highest mean R2 (R2 = 0.685) and the lowest mean RMSE at these two sites (RMSE = 1.66 gC/m2/day) when the vertical stratification information was included in the GPP estimation. Figure 9 indicates that Wu’s model can track the variations in growing season GPP when the vertical stratification information in the canopy is incorporated.Simplifying the vertical stratification parameters in the GPP model will also yield high estimation accuracies. To simplify the parameters when considering vertical stratification during GPP estimation, the adjusted method in Table 4 used the same temperature and VPD for every layer as inputs, the LAI values in different sub-ecosystems were separated from that for the total ecosystem, and LUEmax was used for different sub-ecosystems. The results showed that among all the methods, the adjusted method had the smallest mean bias at the TMK and DHS sites. Additionally, the R2 value differed depending on whether or not multilayer models were considered. This method requires the canopy mean temperature and the VPD and LAI proportions in the understory and overstory, the LUEmax set for different sub-ecosystems, and the incident PAR at the top of the canopy. The data used here are easier to obtain than those required by the multilayer GPP estimation method, and the performance results were also better than those when not considering vertical stratification.Modeled GPP and flux tower-based GPP values still differ to some degree, as illustrated in Figure 10. On a daily scale, the multilayer GPP model has a lower mean bias than the single-layer GPP model. Figure 10b demonstrates that the multilayer method performs well during the growing season (DOY 180 to 280) when the understory LAI is large. On some days when the shortwave incident radiation is high, GPPm was overestimated because the understory PAR was overestimated, but GPPm showed little variance when the understory LAI was low (Figure 10a,b DOY 290 to 360). Most of the results estimated by GPPs were lower than the GPP measured by the flux towers because the understory LUEmax was underestimated. Therefore, the GPP estimation method that considered vertical structure would be useful when the understory LAI is high (>1 m2/m2). Generally, adding the understory vegetation GPP to the total GPP reduces the underestimation when the understory LAI is high.", 4. Results and Analysis, 4.3. Performance of GPP Estimation Results Based on Flux Tower-Based GPP,4
1282,"In this research, we examined the addition of vertical stratification parameters such as temperature, VPD, PAR, LAI, and LUEmax to support remote sensing GPP estimation at the site level. Temperature and VPD influenced the LUEmax at various canopy heights because the vertical meteorology environments have greater variations at forest sites than those in other vegetation types, such as shrub and grass sites. PAR and LAI were used to determine the APAR of different sub-ecosystems, which would lead to a great deal of uncertainty in energy allocation.Vertical LUE is influenced by the vertical distributions of temperature, VPD, and LUEmax, but there are uncertainties when modeling the LUE in different sub-ecosystems. LUEmax values differ in sub-ecosystems, as explained in Section 4.2.1 of this article. At the TMK site, the GPPdif changes from −50% to 30% when the air temperature at the canopy height increases from approximately 7 °C to 20 °C. The variation is more significant at the TMK site than that at the DHS site, and one reason for this difference is that the temperature differences among layers are more obvious at the TMK site than at the DHS site, as shown in Figure 2. The effect of temperature stress on LUE differs for tree, shrub, and grass layers under the same mean canopy weather conditions. As the optimal temperatures of the tree, shrub, and grass layers differ by 2–5 °C at the same air temperatures in the forest canopy, the temperature stresses of the layers on LUEmax differ, varying by 5–20% around the optimal temperature [78,83]. However, when the temperature is above 23 °C, GPPdif changes only slightly because the canopy and the understory layers experience high temperature stress, and the LUE would decrease rapidly at this temperature range. On the other hand, the variation in GPPdif did not significantly change with the increase in VPD, as Figure 6B shows that GPPdif at the DHS site decreases only slightly when the VPD increased. Nepstad et al. [84] showed that the water contents of plants are more related to soil moisture than to the water content of the air in seasonally moist forests. The plants in the overstory and understory layers share the soil water content. Thus, the VPD does not have a significant effect on the GPP estimation in dense forests. All of these effects result in different LUE values at distinct canopy heights, as shown by previous research [85].Uncertainties in the vertical LAI distribution lead to uncertainties in APAR in the sub-ecosystems. LAI, which is a key parameter for separating an ecosystem into different photosynthetic components, determines the contribution of different species to total ecosystem photosynthesis, the light transfer process in the canopy, and the micrometeorological environment inside the forest [58]. As many studies have shown that the distribution of PAR through the canopy structure is highly affected by LAD, LAI, and the characteristics of different species in forest canopies with high heterogeneity, the PAR distribution must consider the vertical structure [39,58,82]. The overstory tree layer determines the intercept ratio of the incident PAR, so if the LAI in the overstory is high, a large amount of PAR would be absorbed during the first turn of intercepted light. The vertical LAI distribution in different vegetation covers follows its own rules (Figure 11), and therefore, remote sensing-based understory and overstory LAI estimations are important for separating the APAR of sub-ecosystems and adding unique LUE values when mapping the global GPP [86,87,88,89]. For all of the cases in a natural environment, when the total LAI is four, the highest GPP appears when all of the leaves are grass species. As shown in Figure 7, the LAI of the grass layer would not be higher than 2 m2/m2, and the highest GPP would thus appear when the LAI of both the tree and grass layers is two. The highest GPP in a dense natural forest would have a ratio of 0.5:0:0.5 for the tree, shrub, and grass layers. Under such circumstances, GPPdif reaches its highest value, and increases in the LUE of both the tree and grass layers would produce a greater GPP. The greatest GPP difference is 25% higher than that estimated via the single-layer method, and if the canopy has a higher proportion of shrubs, the GPP difference is 20% lower. When the proportion of LAI is high in the shrub layer, the total GPP is lower than that estimated by the single-layer method because the shrub LUE is low. As discussed in Section 4.2.2, a high LAI in the understory produces a high GPP because the understory component absorbs diffuse light and provides a better growing environment than that of the overstory. Figure 10 shows that different ecosystems have different vertical LAI ratios. In forest sites such as EBF, DBF, ENF, and DNF, the tree LAI ratio can be 60% or more, and the understory LAI can be as a great as 20% during the growing season. With different LAI distributions in the forest ecosystem, the total APAR allocation of the canopy in a sub-ecosystem would lead to uncertainties in the GPP estimation.Wu’s model exhibited the best performance of the three models. This model better considers the effect of temperature on GPP in overstory and understory layers. Wu’s model and the VPM consider the temperature stresses when the temperature is high. Therefore, these models exhibit better variance when the canopy temperature is high in both the multilayer model and single-layer model. In the VPM, phenology was proven to be an important indicator. However, at the site level, the VPM cannot obtain accurate spatially matched enhanced vegetation index (EVI) values, and the LAI of the canopy changes only slightly during the growing season; thus, we omitted the effect of phenology. In future research on multilayer GPP models, the phenology variance between understory and overstory layers would be a potential way to improve the GPP estimation accuracy in the VPM and Wu’s model.The continuous vertical acquisition of LAI is also challenging. On the one hand, many researchers have shown that remote sensing methods underestimate understory LAI, indicating that other GPP components are also underestimated in dense forests [39,94]. On the other hand, most remote sensing-based LAI products currently do not separate the overstory from the understory in forest sites. Without the LAI of different layers, the GPP of distinct vertical layers cannot be modeled; thus, understory GPP is often underestimated from the high understory LUE.Future versions of remote sensing-based GPP products should add forest vertical stratification information to GPP models. For example, the use of remote sensing-based understory and overstory LAI [90,91,92,93] to separate sub-ecosystems and the addition of prior LUE when combining the specific LUEmax from sub-ecosystem-based temperature and VPD response functions can improve GPP estimations compared to the performance of approaches that do not consider the vertical structure (“adjusted” method in Table 4). The ‘adjusted’ method in Table 4 showed lower systemic biases and a RMSE that was similar to that of GPPm, which indicated that this method has an estimation accuracy that is similar to that of the multilayer method. However, this method requires only the two main data sources as prior information, the LUEmax in height of the canopy, the canopy mean air temperature, VPD, and the LAI values of the sub-ecosystems, which are simple to obtain via remote sensing. This method can potentially be applied in remote sensing-based multilayer GPP models. Thus, a high GPP estimation accuracy could be obtained in ecosystems with high understory LAI values by considering the vertical structure (multilayer model).The accuracy of GPP estimates in a complicated, vertically stratified forest canopy where the understory LAI is high (e.g., in a tropical rainforest or old-growth forest) can be improved by using multilayer methods. Additionally, Wu’s model showed that a potential model could estimate the GPP with multilayer data inputs, but further global validation of the GPP model parameters is needed. Some articles have added vertical stratification data to GPP estimations in cropland [95,96], but unlike the homogeneous landscape in croplands, a vertical structure would lead to variations in the physiological parameters of vegetation in forest sites. Thus, there are still some limitations to this study.", 5. Discussion,None,5
1283,"In this article, we used three different LUE-based GPP models to analyze the effect of vertical vegetation stratification on GPP calculations. Additionally, in situ temperature, VPD, and PAR data were used to analyze the environmental factors that control GPP modeling. The results showed the following. (1) Vertical temperature and VPD stratification at the selected sites varied with the forest type, time of day, and season, but the difference was not significant. Moreover, incident PAR followed the Beer–Lambert law; there was a significant difference between the overstory and understory layers, and this difference was affected by the distributions of LAI in different sub-ecosystems. (2) The stratifications of temperature, VPD, PAR, LAI, and LUEmax have an interactive influence on the improvement of GPPm. Due to the importance of PAR in the estimation of GPP, the stratification of PAR becomes obvious when the incident PAR increases and the difference between GPPm and GPPs exceeds 50% of GPPs. GPPdif is approximately 30% when temperature stratification is considered, and this value is 20% when LAI stratification is considered. Multilayer LUEmax inputs are important for accurate GPP estimations, and different inputs may lead to contrary results concerning the difference between GPPm and GPPs. Therefore, quantitatively corrected understory LUEmax reduces the bias in GPP estimations. (3) The accuracy of the GPP estimation can be improved by using multilayer models, but the improvement is related to the forest type, the stratification of the canopy, and the growing conditions. Furthermore, the improvement is more obvious when the multilayer model is applied to canopies with obvious vertical stratification under optimal growing conditions. In this article, GPPm was the most accurate at the TMK site from July to September. Since a multilayer GPP estimation model considers the high photosynthetic ability and LAI of grass, GPPm is always larger than GPPs. However, when the conditions are not optimal for growth—for example, if the temperature becomes very low or high—the GPPm will be smaller than the GPPs.In future studies on GPP remote sensing products, vertical stratification should be considered in the models. Adding overstory and understory information such as LAI and LUEmax for diverse sub-ecosystems can improve the estimation accuracy of the GPP product.", 6. Conclusions,None,6
